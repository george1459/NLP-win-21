                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 September 18  2007 Washington  D C  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement on the Senate floor regarding the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008     Mr  President  September has arrived  Having received the much anticipated testimony of General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker  the U S  Senate now begins a debate of historic proportions     At stake is nothing less than the future of Iraq  the Middle East  and the security of all Americans for decades to come  The Senate faces a series of stark choices  whether to build on the success of the surge and fight for additional gains  or whether to set a date for American surrender in Iraq and suffer thereby the terrible consequences that will ensue  As we consider each of the Iraq related amendments filed on this bill  let us understand the enormous consequences of decisions taken here  Henry Kissinger framed the debate in a Washington Post article this weekend  saying  American decisions in the next few months will affect the confidence and morale of potential targets  potential allies and radical jihadists around the globe  Above all  they will define the U S  capacity to contribute to a safer and better world     Let us proceed with this debate  keeping in mind that the underlying bill  the National Defense Authorization Act  contains many non Iraq provisions that constitute good defense policy and that will strengthen the ability of our country to defend itself  That is why the Committee voted unanimously to report the bill  which fully funds the Presidents  648 billion defense budget request  authorizes a 3 5 percent pay raise for all military personnel  increases Army and Marine end strength  reforms the system that serves wounded veterans  and provides necessary measures to avoid waste  fraud  and abuse in defense procurement  Its a good bill  and I believe that we need to send it to the Presidents desk     While the Senate moved off the bill in July and onto other things  and then went into a month long recess  American soldiers  Marines  sailors and airmen continued fighting bravely and tenaciously in Iraq  in concert with their Iraqi counterparts  Some Senators undoubtedly welcomed the delay in considering the defense bill  believing that General Petraeus would deliver to Congress a report filled only with defeat and despair  If this was their hope  they were sorely disappointed  As we all now know  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker reported what some of us argued before the bill was pulled two months ago  that the surge is working  that we are making progress toward our goals  and that success  while long  hard  and by no means certain  is possible     We are succeeding only after four years of failures  years that have exacted an enormous cost on our country and on the brave men and women who fight in Iraq on our behalf  Some of us from the beginning warned against the Rumsfeld strategy of too few troops  insufficient resources  and a plan predicated on hope rather than on the difficult business of stabilization and counterinsurgency  We lost years to that strategy  years we cannot get back  In the process  the American people became saddened  frustrated  and angry     I  too  am heartsick at the terrible price we have paid for nearly four years of mismanaged war  But I also know that America cannot simply end this effort in frustration and accept the terrible consequences of defeat in Iraq  We cannot choose to lose in Iraq  and I believe that we must give our commanders the time and support theyve asked for to win this war  Ralph Peters  the distinguished military strategist  summed it up best  noting that Congress failure to support General Petraeus would be a shame  since  after nearly four years of getting it miserably wrong in Iraq  were finally getting it right     In two days of testimony and countless interviews  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker described how we are finally getting it right  We finally have in place a counterinsurgency strategy  one that we should have been following from the beginning  which makes the most effective use of our strength and does not advance the tactics of our enemy  This new strategy  backed by a tactical surge in troops  is the only approach that has resulted in real security improvements in Iraq     General Petraeus reported that the overall number of security incidents in Iraq has declined in 8 of the past 12 weeks  and that sectarian violence has dropped substantially since the change in strategy  Civilian deaths nationwide are down by nearly half since December  and have dropped by some 70 percent in Baghdad  Deaths resulting from sectarian violence have come down by 80 percent since December and the number of car bombings and suicide attacks has declined in each of the past five months  Anyone who has traveled recently to Anbar  or Diyala  or Baghdad  can see the improvements that have taken place over the past months  With violence down  commerce has risen and the bottom up efforts to forge counterterrorism alliances are bearing tangible fruit  This is not to argue that Baghdad or other areas have suddenly become safe  they have not  but such positive developments illustrate General Petraeus contention that American and Iraqi forces have achieved substantial progress     There are many challenges remaining  and the road ahead is long and tough  The Maliki government has not taken advantage of our efforts to enable reconciliation and is not functioning as it must  While violence has declined significantly  it remains high and success is not certain  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Congress choose to lose  by legislating a date for withdrawal  and thus surrender  or mandating a change in mission that would undermine our efforts in Iraq  then  Mr  President  we will fail for certain     Make no mistake  the consequences of Americas defeat in Iraq will be terrible and long lasting  There is in some corners a belief that we can simply turn the page in Iraq  come home  and move on to other things  This is dangerously wrong  If we surrender in Iraq  we will be back  in Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure  Two weeks ago  General Jim Jones testified before the Armed Services Committee and outlined what he believes to be the consequences of such a course        a precipitous departure which results in a failed state in Iraq  he said  will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists  jihadists       in the world  who will believe that they will have toppled the major power on Earth and that all else is possible  And I think it will not only make us less safe  it will make our friends and allies less safe  And the struggle will continue  It will simply be done in different and in other areas     Some senators would like to withdraw our troops from Iraq so we can get back to fighting what they believe to be the real war on terror  This  too  is inaccurate  Iraq has become the central front in the global war on terror  and failure there would turn Iraq into a terrorist sanctuary  in the heart of the Middle East  next door to Iran  the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism  If we fail in Iraq  we will concede territory to jihadists to plan attacks against America and our friends and allies  The region could easily descend into chaos  wider war  and genocide  and we should have no doubt about who will take advantage  The Iranian president has stated his intentions bluntly  saying  Soon  we will see a huge power vacuum in the region  Of course  we are prepared to fill the gap     We cannot allow an Iranian dominated Middle East to take shape in the context of wider war and terrorist safehavens  General Jones is just one of many distinguished national security experts who warn against the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  As Brent Scowcroft said  The costs of staying are visible  the costs of getting out are almost never discussed      If we get out before Iraq is stable  the entire Middle East region might start to resemble Iraq today  Getting out is not a solution  Natan Sharansky has written that a precipitous withdrawal of U S  forces could lead to a bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by comparison  And Henry Kissinger warns that  An abrupt withdrawal from Iraq would not end the war  it would only redirect it     The proponents of withdrawal counter that none of these terrible consequences would unfold should any of their various proposals become law  On the contrary  they argue  U S  forces could  when not engaged in training the Iraqi forces  engage in targeted counterterrorism operations  But our own military commanders say that such a narrow approach to the complex Iraqi security environment will not succeed  and that moving in with search and destroy missions to kill and capture terrorists  only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy  is a recipe for failure  How can they be so sure  Its simple  Mr  President  this focus on training and counterterrorism constitutes the very strategy that so plainly failed for the first four years of this war  To return to such an unsuccessful approach is truly staying the course  and it is a course that will inevitably lead to our defeat and to catastrophic consequences for Iraq  the region  and the security of the United States     General Petraeus and his commanders have embraced a new strategy  one that can  over time  lead to success in Iraq  They are fighting smarter and better  and in a way that can give Iraqis the security and opportunity to make decisions necessary to save their country from the abyss of genocide and a permanent and spreading war  and in a way that will safeguard fundamental American interests  They ask just two things of us  the time to continue this strategy and the support they need to carry out their mission  They must have both  and I will fight to ensure that they do     As we engage in this debate  I hope that each of us will recall our most solemn allegiance  which is not to party or politics but to country  I have heard on this floor the claim that our efforts in Iraq somehow constitute Bushs war or the Republican war  Nothing could be farther from the truth  Presidents do not lose wars  Political parties do not lose wars  Nations lose wars and suffer the consequences  or prevail and enjoy the blessings of their success     All of us want our troops to come home  and to come home as soon as possible  But we should want our soldiers to return to us with honor  the honor of victory that is due all of those who have paid with the ultimate sacrifice  We have many responsibilities to the people who elected us  but one responsibility outweighs all the others  and that is to protect this great and good nation from all enemies foreign and domestic     This is a serious debate  Mr  President  and one we engage at a time of national peril  The Americans who make the greatest sacrifices have earned the right to insist that we do our duty  as best we can and remember to whom and what we owe our first allegiance  to the security of the American people and to the ideals upon which our nation was founded                                             September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
