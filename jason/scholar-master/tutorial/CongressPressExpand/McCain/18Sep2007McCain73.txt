                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON LEVIN REED TROOP WITHDRAWAL AMENDMENT  September 20  2007  Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement about the Levin Reed amendment about a timetable for withdrawal of U S  troops from Iraq     Mr  President  I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Chairman and the Senator from Rhode Island that would mandate a withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq     Again  we find ourselves on the floor of this chamber debating an amendment that is nearly identical to one that failed just two months ago  The pending amendment would mandate a withdrawal of U S  combat forces within 90 days of enactment  leaving a smaller force authorized only to carry out narrowly defined missions  And the Senate faces  once again  a simple choice  whether to build on the successes of our new strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and support needed to carry out their mission  or to ignore the realities on the ground and legislate a premature end to our efforts in Iraq  accepting thereby all the terrible consequences that will ensue     Many senators wished to postpone this choice  preferring to await the testimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  Last week these two career officers reported unambiguously that the new strategy is succeeding in Iraq  Knowing what we now know  that our military is making progress on the ground  and that their commanders request from us the time and support necessary to succeed in Iraq  a measure of courage is required  Not the great courage exhibited by those brave men and women fighting on our behalf  but a smaller measure  the courage necessary to put Americas interests before every personal or political consideration     It is important that as we proceed with consideration of this amendment we spend a few moments reviewing the current state of affairs in Iraq  We see today that  after nearly four years of mismanaged war  the situation on the ground in Iraq shows demonstrable signs of progress  The final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus new counter insurgency plan have been in place for over two months and our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  is making significant gains in a number of areas     General Petraeus reported in detail on these gains during his testimony in both houses and in countless interviews  The number two U S  commander in Iraq  Lt  Gen  Ray Odierno  said today that the seven month old security operation has reduced violence in Baghdad by some 50 percent  that car bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have fallen to their lowest level in a year  and that civilian casualties have dropped from a high of 32 per day to 12 per day  His comments were echoed by Lt  Gen  Abboud Qanbar  the Iraqi commander  who said that before the surge began  one third of Baghdads 507 districts were under insurgent control  Today  he said  only five to six districts can be called hot areas  Anyone who has traveled recently to Anbar  or Diyala  or Baghdad  can see the improvements that have taken place over the past months  With violence down  commerce has risen and the bottom up efforts to forge counterterrorism alliances are bearing tangible fruit     None of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have suddenly become safe  or that violence has come down to acceptable levels  As General Odierno pointed out  violence is still too high and there are many unsafe areas  Nevertheless  such positive developments illustrate General Petraeus contention last week that American and Iraqi forces have achieved substantial progress under their new strategy     It is instructive to reflect on how far some areas have come  One year ago  in September 2006  the Washington Post ran a story titled  Situation Called Dire in West Iraq  Anbar is Lost Politically  Marine Analyst Says  After an offensive by U S  and Iraqi troops cleaned al Qaeda fighters out of Ramadi and other areas of western Anbar  the provinces tribal sheikhs  disgusted by the brutality and blatant disregard for human life exhibited by their aggressors  broke formally with the terrorists and joined the coalition side  As a result  Anbar  which last year stood as Iraqs most dangerous province  is now one of its safest     Some proponents of the pending amendment have suggested that Anbar is an aberration  unrelated to the surge and unable to be replicated elsewhere in Iraq  I asked General Petraeus about this during his appearance before the Armed Services Committee  and he said the following        the success in Anbar province  correctly  is a political success  But it is a political success that has been enabled  very much  by our forces that have been enabled by having additional forces in Anbar province  Ambassador Crocker added that such scenes are also unfolding in parts of Diyala and Ninewa  where Iraqis have mobilized with the help of Coalition and Iraqi security forces     Like in Anbar and elsewhere  where local populations have turned on al Qaedas brutal methods  there are reports of Shia extremists encountering a similar reception  Recent attacks by the Mahdi Army on worshippers in the holy city of Karbala prompted a public backlash that led Muqtada al Sadr to order a suspension of all military actions by his followers against Iraqi and Coalition forces     In Baghdad  the military  in cooperation with Iraqi security forces  continues to man joint security stations and deploy throughout the city in order to bring violence under control  These efforts have produced positive results  sectarian violence has fallen since the beginning of the year  the total number of car bombings and suicide attacks declined  and the number of locals coming forward with intelligence tips has risen     None of this is to suggest that the road in Iraq remains anything but long and hard  Violence remains at unacceptable levels  the Maliki government remains paralyzed and unwilling to function as it must  and other difficulties abound  No one can guarantee success or be certain about its prospects  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Congress succeed in terminating the strategy by legislating an abrupt withdrawal and a transition to a new  less effective and more dangerous course  should we do that  then we will fail for certain     Let us make no mistake about the costs of such an American failure in Iraq  Many of my colleagues would like to believe that  should the amendment we are currently considering become law  it would mark the end of this long effort  They are wrong  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement  If we leave  we will be back  in Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure     In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee last week  General Petraeus referred to an August Defense Intelligence Agency report that stated  a rapid withdrawal would result in the further release of strong centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a number of dangerous results  including a high risk of disintegration of the Iraqi Security Forces  a rapid deterioration of local security initiatives  al Qaeda Iraq regaining lost ground and freedom of maneuver  a marked increase in violence and further ethno sectarian displacement and refugee flows  and exacerbation of already challenging regional dynamics  especially with respect to Iran  Those are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal  and I hope that the supporters of such a move will tell us how they intend to address the chaos and catastrophe that would surely follow such a course of action     No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality of Iraq to the war on terror  there can simply be no debate that our efforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against violent Islamic extremism  Earlier this month  General Jim Jones testified before the Armed Services Committee and outlined what he believes to be the consequences of such a course        a precipitous departure which results in a failed state in Iraq  he said  will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists  jihadists       in the world  who will believe that they will have toppled the major power on Earth and that all else is possible  And I think it will not only make us less safe  it will make our friends and allies less safe  And the struggle will continue  It will simply be done in different and in other areas     The supporters of this amendment respond that they do not by any means intend to cede the battlefield to al Qaeda  on the contrary  their legislation would allow U S  forces  presumably holed up in forward operating bases  to carry out targeted counterterrorism operations  But our own military commanders say that this approach will not succeed  and that moving in with search and destroy missions to kill and capture terrorists  only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy  is the failed Rumsfeld strategy of the past nearly four years  We should not  and must not  return to such a disastrous course     The strategy that General Petraeus has put into place  a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protecting the population  which gets our troops out of the bases and into the areas they are trying to protect  and which supplies sufficient force levels to carry out the mission  is the right one  By returning troops to forward operating bases and confining their activities to training and targeted counterterrorism operations would mean a return to the failed Rumsfeld strategy  at the very time that the Petraeus strategy is showing progress     Some of this amendments proponents suggest that  while the security effects of its passage might be to vastly increase violence in Iraq  this is somehow a good thing  as it will prompt the Iraqis to take the tough political decisions on reconciliation they have been heretofore unwilling to make  The trouble with this argument is that it is plainly contradicted by the entire history of our involvement in Iraq  Where we have seen political progress  in Anbar  in Diyala  and elsewhere  that progress has followed a reduction in violence  Where we have seen a great expansion in the carnage  political solutions have been much less likely  if not impossible     This is  of course  in accordance with longstanding counterinsurgency doctrine  which emphasizes instilling security first  And it is a truth that must sound the death knell for this amendment  because it means that such a reduction in troops would make political reconciliation virtually impossible  We would  in short  be choosing to lose  As the most recent National Intelligence Estimate put it  the very perception that the coalition is withdrawing probably will encourage factions anticipating a power vacuum to seek local security solutions that could intensify sectarian violence and intra sectarian competition     It has become clear by now that we cannot set a date for withdrawal without setting a date for surrender  Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability  we invite chaos  genocide  terrorist safehavens and regional war  We invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons  training fighters  providing resources  and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq  If any of my colleagues remain unsure of Irans intentions in the region  may I direct them to the recent remarks of the Iranian president  who said  The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly      Soon  we will see a huge power vacuum in the region  Of course  we are prepared to fill the gap  If our notions of national security have any meaning  they cannot include permitting the establishment of an Iranian dominated Middle East that is roiled by wider regional war and riddled with terrorist safehavens     The hour is indeed late in Iraq  How we have arrived at this critical and desperate moment has been well chronicled  and historys judgment about the long catalogue of mistakes in the prosecution of this war will be stern and unforgiving  But history will revere the honor and the sacrifice of those Americans  who despite the mistakes and failures of both civilian and military leaders  shouldered a rifle and risked everything  everything  so that the country they love so well might not suffer the many dangerous consequences of defeat     That is what General Petraeus  and the Americans he has the honor to command  are trying to do  to fight smarter and better  in a way that addresses and doesnt strengthen the tactics of the enemy  and to give the Iraqis the security and opportunity to make the necessary political decisions to save their country from the abyss of genocide and a permanent and spreading war  Now is not the time for us to lose our resolve  We must remain steadfast in our mission  for we do not fight only for the interests of Iraqis  Mr  President  we fight for ours as well     In this moment of serious peril for America  we must all of us remember to who and what we owe our first allegiance  to the security of the American people and to the ideals upon which we our nation was founded  That responsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged by history to have discharged it honorably will  in the end  matter so much more to all of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim  electoral advantage or office  I hope we might all have good reason to expect a kinder judgment of our flaws and follies because when it mattered most we chose to put the interests of this great and good nation before our own  and helped  in our own small way  preserve for all humanity the magnificent and inspiring example of an assured  successful and ever advancing America and the ideals that make us still the greatest nation on earth                                            September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
