                                                                                                                         ADDRESS TO THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORK June 12  2006 New York  NY    Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following address to the Economic Club of New York   Thank you  it s a great pleasure to be here today   My friends  more than twenty five years after Ronald Reagan rededicated our national energies to the principles of personal  political  and economic freedom  his legacy has helped to change the world profoundly   We have proven that empowering free markets and free people is the bulwark of liberty and the surest means to prosperity  We have helped other countries embrace our free market principles  and they have flourished beyond their wildest imaginations  But the United States remains the most prosperous country on earth   Ronald Reagan s generation    the greatest generation fought the evils of despotism and bequeathed to us  at tremendous cost  a country free and secure  We have honored the sacrifices of our forebears by nurturing and protecting our inheritance  taking up the responsibilities of freedom  and building a nation and an economy that is the envy of the world   While the world is freer  it is still dangerous  While it is more prosperous  there is still much that threatens the progress we have made both at home and abroad  America s national security and economic prosperity have always gone hand in hand  Fulfilling the promise of American greatness in a global economy rests on our ability to provide a safe and stable environment for working men and women  for innovators and entrepreneurs  and for our children on whom the world will soon depend  as they have depended on us  to advance the glorious cause of human freedom   What would our parents  who fought and died in Europe and the Pacific to defeat totalitarianism  say about the challenges we face  They would answer  as it has been from the day we declared our independence  our peace and prosperity rest on our faithfulness to our ideals and our courage   We have much to be hopeful about  The great promise of participating in the prosperous world economy has led nations to move toward freer and more open systems   But our success in building a world where people compete as entrepreneurs in the market place rather than as adversaries on battlefields  rests on the free world s ability to maintain peace and stability  secure the global commons for the exercise of liberty  and provide for the free flow of ideas  goods  and services  These goals are a central part of our nation s security  defense  and military strategies   But no security strategy can succeed without a firm economic foundation  My friends  we know that in war there is no substitute for victory  In peace there is no substitute for growth  All nations hold a stake in our economic progress  End growth in America and the lights go out all over the world   Even so  America s greatness makes it a primary target for those who oppose the spread of the principles we cherish  Democracy  freedom  security  and prosperity are the four pillars of human progress  The strength of each depends greatly on that of the others  and the enemies of liberty know that   Looking back to the events of 9 11  we cannot rid from our memories the terrible human tragedies that occurred    the loss of life  devastation  and destruction  However  it is easy to forget the economic dimensions of that horrible day  Our enemies targeted the American economy and made the disruption of our financial markets one of their primary goals  The economy was  we now know  already in recession  Financial markets tumbled  Analysts worried that the risk taking and entrepreneurship that have been the engine of our prosperity would be hampered by fear and uncertainty  For many  the only question was how far the economy would sink   Yet a tremendous thing happened  As our nation rose to confront our enemies  American workers and entrepreneurs resumed their productivity with renewed confidence  Who in the world thought back then that the years ahead would deliver high growth  millions of new jobs  and soaring wealth  Americans did  my friends  Americans   Our government must stand up resolutely for our ideals as the American people have whenever they have been tested    not only to discourage and defeat those who would attack us and challenge the cause of freedom  but to further empower Americans to take the risks and make the investments that will make our country stronger  Fulfilling our security responsibilities requires a sober and honest assessment of the threats to our security  reaching across boundaries to engage allies in our cause  and strategic thinking that anticipates the dangers posed in today s world and tomorrow s   Just as we must anticipate and confront outside threats using all instruments of our national power  we must face the very real threats emanating from home that endanger our prosperity  Even in a world of political stability  our current economic policies will undermine our economic well being   A tsunami of entitlement spending is threatening our economy  while providing no real security to retirees  We have made promises that we cannot keep  Under moderately optimistic scenarios Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid will in the decades to come grow as large as the entire government is today  Someday the government will be forced to make drastic cuts in these programs  or crippling increases in taxes on workers    or both  The longer we wait to make the hard choices necessary to repair these programs  the harder the problem becomes  My children and their children will not receive the benefits we will enjoy  That is an inescapable fact  and any politician who tells you otherwise  Democrat or Republican  is lying   It is hardly statesmanship to ignore the obvious imperative of reducing the growth of spending for retiree income support  health care  and long term care  And yet  year after year  our government fails to act  This failure has a real and distressing cost  Our workers make their retirement plans based on promised benefits that cannot be paid even if we burden our children with crippling taxes  If we fix the system now  people will have time to plan accordingly  to ensure that they still have a comfortable retirement  If we wait  we make the problem worse and  in effect  lie to Americans who we encouraged to put their trust in a broken system   I have long supported supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts    but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept  People of good faith in both parties agree that we must make the hard decisions to restore solvency to these programs and that personal accounts can ease the impact of slower benefit growth  But  too often  we prefer to nurture our own ambitions rather than defend the public interest  It is long past time for our two parties to sit down together and fix our pressing entitlement problems  And while it is a smaller problem than health care  we should start with Social Security because the fix is obvious in comparison  and much simpler   While booming entitlement spending threatens us in the long run  our short term fiscal situation is terrible as well  In the past six years  government spending has gone from irresponsible to utterly indefensible  The numbers should shock us  and government s indifference to them should shame us  According to the latest figures  spending in the 2005 fiscal year was  683 billion higher than it was in 2000  If we had simply held spending growth in check we would not have a budget deficit today   Some of this money has necessarily been spent on the war on terror that was unexpected and has been obviously and hugely expensive  While at the same time we know we must focus most of our defense spending on tomorrow s threats  not yesterday s  But when Ronald Reagan increased defense spending to win the Cold War  he slowed non defense spending growth at the same time  This time  we have fallen again for that most alluring delusion  we have tried to have our cake and eat it too  Non defense spending  often on the most unnecessary projects  is out of control   Legislators pass pork filled bills without the fear of public retribution or presidential veto  Federal spending  and the special interest earmarks that destroy the budget process and waste taxpayer dollars by the billions continues at a breakneck pace  Sadly  we haven t reformed the bankrupt tax and spend policies decried by Ronald Reagan  We have  it is now evident  merely replaced them with a new and even more insidious scheme of borrow and spend  We are fooling no one  my friends  Inevitably  the bill will come due  In the mean time  we rack up big debts  With those debts come higher and higher interest payments each year  Instead of spending the tax payers  dollars on real priorities  more and more of them will be devoted simply to keeping the bill collectors at bay  Bills that perpetuate wasteful spending should be vetoed    not some of them  all of them   I have always believed in the power of the American people  and the importance of keeping marginal tax rates low  But  tax cuts work best when accompanied by lower spending  In recent years I have opposed some Republican fiscal initiatives out of concern for the absence of spending restraint  and the higher deficits they cause  which hamstring our ability to respond to future crises   But the answer to these deficits is not to raise new taxes or repeal tax cuts but to restrain our spending habits  If the federal government can t be funded with current revenues than we must reduce its size  Higher taxes and greater spending discourage entrepreneurship  foster wasteful tax planning and slow long term growth  Intelligently formulated tax cuts and sensible tax reform will deliver much higher growth when they are accompanied by lower spending   When the government s budget is tighter  the family budget won t have to be  If our government is forced to make more hard choices  our families will be forced to make fewer   Recent events have also made it clear that rising energy costs and our dangerous dependence on an unreliable supply from unstable parts of the world is potentially crippling to our economy  When Wall Street wants to limit risk  it diversifies  The obvious approach to resolve our energy problems is to increase and diversify our sources of power and look for ways to reduce our demand  We have promising technologies in development  but also proven alternatives at hand    the most obvious of which is nuclear   Genuine improvement in our energy security  must respect markets and avoid the temptations of nearsighted politics  While it is tempting to assail windfall profits and executive compensation  it is not a substitute for a viable and long term energy strategy  We will never be fully independent of global energy markets  But we must work for the day that energy supply volatility no longer imperils our economy and our security   A global rising tide of protectionism and a retreat from market based economic policy is threatening the entrepreneurs of developed and developing countries alike   Free trade is the key to global economic growth  and a key to U S  economic success  We need stand up for free trade with no ifs  ands or buts about it  We let trade and globalization be politicized at our own peril   Today  despite all the defeatist rhetoric  America is the world s biggest exporter  importer  producer  saver  investor  manufacturer and innovator  Americans do not shy from the challenge of competition  they welcome it  Because of that  we attract foreign investment from all over the world  Our government should welcome competition as the people do  and not resort to mindless protectionism   While we embrace free trade  it is important to recognize that trade can lead to painful dislocations for some individuals  We must remain committed to education  retraining  and help for displaced workers all the while reminding ourselves that our ability to change is a great strength of our nation  We cannot let fear and the appeals of protectionists lead us backward   My friends  in the course of my lifetime our economy has undergone unbelievable changes  When I was a kid  our economy grew by producing more and more of the same  We now have an ideas economy where growth comes from making new things  not larger quantities of the old things   If you walked into my house when I was twenty years old  my parents would have proudly displayed the same appliances they had when I was ten years old  Today I walk into my own house and am awestruck by the marvels my family uses    flash drives  Ipods and Tivos  things we never could have dreamed of  have become part of our every day lives   Our economy is like that now  Advances in information technologies have made us better at discovery  quicker to find the new idea that works  In this world  America has succeeded because we have been more willing to embrace and encourage change than our competitors  And we have opened our doors to the best and brightest from other countries to seek the American dream  The transformation has been dramatic  Today  American firms spend more money each year researching new ideas and processes than they do on new buildings and machines   As our economy has changed  too often  Washington has not kept pace  The business community understands the borderless world of the global economy far better than most policymakers and Washington has much to learn from you  Today  old industries dominate the trade debate  even while the intellectual property rights of our most innovative firms are ignored by some of our trading partners  An effective government must evolve with the economy and protect our ideas  and keep the new economy free of bureaucratic interference  restrictive red tape and unnecessary regulations   The challenges are great  but the costs of failure even greater   We now accept that the world where a worker can expect to stay with one employer  making one product  for the rest of his life  is gone forever  That willingness to change has brought us great wealth  but it has produced anxiety as well  While the economy is booming  surveys suggest that Americans are much more anxious about our future economic  political  and physical security   Some of that anxiety is perhaps justified  Change can cause dislocation and fear  and the opportunities of economic growth are not always apparent to all Americans  These anxieties are exacerbated when those elected to govern spend more of our time on our own ambitions than their concerns  We face serious challenges  and many Americans worry that their government cannot be relied on to face them forthrightly  We have given them cause for that concern   But America s strength has always resided in its people    in their industry  courage and imagination  A government accountable to such a people cannot forever ignore their priorities  burden their industry  impede their progress  It is a wonderful thing to be elected to high office in this great and good republic  But it is a shameful thing to cherish that office more than you value the public good   The times we live in pose difficult  but no greater challenges to us than we have faced in the past  Americans will meet them  as they always have  confident that a nation conceived in liberty will prove stronger  more decent and more enduring than any nation ordered to exalt the few at the expense of the many or made from a common race or culture or to preserve traditions that have no greater attribute than longevity   Those of us privileged to serve such a people  must prove an equal faith in the strength and righteousness of our ideals  confident that we hold a greater privilege than high office  that we have the honorable distinction of being part of a people living as one nation  in a kinship of ideals  who are making of our power and wealth a civilization for the ages  a civilization in which all people might share in the blessings and responsibilities of freedom                                              June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
