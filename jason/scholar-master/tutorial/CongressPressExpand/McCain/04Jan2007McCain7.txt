12  2007 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement before the Senate Committee on Armed Servicespreceding testimony byChairman of the Joint ChiefsPeter Pace and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on the current situation in Iraq    Chairman Levin  Thank you   I join our Chairman in welcoming our witnesses here today  I am very pleased to serve again with the returning members of our Committee and wish to welcome all of the new members to the Committee   Mr  Chairman  it is a hard thing to change course in the middle of a war  I commend the President for recognizing the mistakes of the past  and for outlining new steps on the military  economic  and political fronts  I believe that  together  these moves will give the Iraqis     and America     the best chance of success    We should make no mistake   the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure demand that we do all we can to prevail in Iraq  A substantial and sustained increase in U S  forces in Baghdad and Anbar province is necessary to bring down the toxic levels of violence there    There is much agreement that the dire situation in Iraq demands a political solution  That is true  But we must also realize what it will take to enable any political solution  It is simply impossible for meaningful political and economic activity to take place in an environment as riddled with violence as Baghdad is today  Security is the precondition for political and economic progress    Until the government and its coalition allies can protect the population  the Iraqi people will increasingly turn to extra governmental forces  especially Sunni and Shiite militias  for protection  Only when the government has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force will its authority have meaning  and only when its authority has meaning can political activity have the results we seek     The presence of additional coalition forces would allow the Iraqi government to do what it cannot accomplish today on its own   impose its rule throughout the country  They can do this by engaging in traditional counterinsurgency activities aimed at protecting the population and breaking the cycle of violence  In bringing greater security to Iraq  and chiefly to Baghdad  our forces would give the government a fighting chance to pursue reconciliation   As I have said before  a small  short surge would be the worst of all worlds  We need troops in the numbers required to do the job  in place for as long as it takes to complete their mission  We must ensure that we are committing sufficient numbers of additional troops  and I look forward to our witnesses    testimony on this score  It would be far better to have too many reinforcements in Iraq than to suffer  once again  the tragic results of insufficient force levels   The other elements of the President   s strategy are also critical  The Iraqi government must meet new benchmarks  including a reconciliation process for insurgents and Baathists  more equitable distribution of government resources  sharing oil revenue with the entire Iraqi population  and holding provincial elections that will bring Sunnis into government  And Iraq   s neighbors need to play a more constructive role  I would like to see the Saudis  for example  fund a major jobs creation program in Iraq  The Gulf states must not fiddle while Baghdad burns     I know that some of my colleagues disagree with a troop increase in Iraq  and I have heard the calls for a withdrawal to begin in 4 to 6 months  Those who advocate such a policy have a right     even an obligation     to join the debate on this issue  But I believe these individuals also have a responsibility to tell us what they believe are the consequences of withdrawal in Iraq  Do they not fear Iranian  Saudi  and Turkish involvement in Iraq  A wider regional war  A haven for terrorists  A humanitarian catastrophe  Do they truly believe that we can walk away from Iraq     We were able to walk away from Vietnam  If we walk away from Iraq  we will be back     possibly in the context of a wider war in the world   s most volatile region  I believe that those who disagree with this new policy should indicate what they would propose to do if we withdraw and Iraq descends into chaos     We have made many  many mistakes since 2003  and these will not be easily reversed  Even greater than the costs thus far and in the future  however  are the catastrophic consequences that would ensue from our failure in Iraq  By surging troops and bringing security to Baghdad and other areas  we will give the Iraqis and their partners the best possible chances to succeed    From everything I saw during my trip to Iraq last month  I believe that success is still possible  And I would not support this new strategy if I didn   t think it had a real chance of success  But let us realize that there are no guarantees  By controlling the violence  we can pave the way for a political settlement  Once the government wields greater authority  however  Iraqi leaders must take significant steps on their own  and they must do it right away   Increasing U S  troop levels will expose more brave Americans to danger and increase the number of American casualties  When Congress authorized this war  we were committing America to a mission that entails the greatest sacrifice a country can make  one that falls disproportionately on those Americans who love their country so much that they volunteer to risk their lives to accomplish that mission  And when we authorized this war  we accepted the responsibility to make sure they could prevail  Increasing deployments is a terrible sacrifice to impose on the best patriots among us  My travels and meeting with many service members lead me to believe  however  that these Americans will once again do everything they can to win this war   I will conclude by commending the President   s announcement Wednesday night that he plans to increase the standing size of the Army and Marine Corps by some 92 000 soldiers and Marines  Such a step is long overdue  particularly given our commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan  and I believe that the increase in end strength is in the national security interests of our country  I hope it will receive the backing of all senators   Chairman Levin  thank you  I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses here today                                               January 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
