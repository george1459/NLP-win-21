                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN CALLS FOR  COMPREHENSIVE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE  TO CRISIS IN BURMA October 10  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today released the following statement about the crushing of Burma s Saffron Revolution     For years  the people of Burma have endured violence and repression at the hands of a cruel military regime  Responding again and again with prayers and peaceful resistance  the Burmese people  led by that remarkable woman Aung San Suu Kyi  show the world the real meaning of courage     And the thugs who run Burma have shown  once again  the true face of their tyranny  In crushing the Saffron Revolution  killing hundreds and jailing thousands   including countless Buddhist monks   the junta has left no doubt about its intentions  Nor should the world have any doubt about ours  We stand on the side of freedom  not fear  of peace  not violence  and of the millions in Burma who aspire to a better life  not those who would keep them isolated and oppressed     Make no mistake  the crisis is not over  Reports continue to emerge about the fate of those in detention  and today there are indications that a member of Burma s opposition party has died under interrogation by security forces  Aung San Suu Kyi remains a captive  and her National League for Democracy barred from assuming the government offices they legitimately won long ago     All those who know and admire Suu Kyi were heartbroken to see photos of her meeting last week with U N  Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari  Serene as always  Suu Kyi appeared at home  away from her people  imprisoned by a cruel  thuggish  and illegitimate regime     I had the great honor to meet Aung San Suu Kyi years ago  She is a woman of astonishing courage and incredible resolve  Her determination in the face of tyranny inspires me  and every individual who holds democracy dear     Burma s rulers fear Aung San Suu Kyi because of what she represents   peace  freedom and justice for all Burmese people  The world must now respond to the junta s actions in a way that demonstrates the inevitability of those values so clearly demonstrated by Ms  Suu Kyi     The President s recently announced banking sanctions  while welcome  are just one element of a comprehensive international response that is required in the face of the junta s crimes     Specifically  the following actions must be taken       The Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  should move beyond issuing statements and immediately convene an emergency meeting to expel Burma       The United States should work with the United Nations   but also outside the U N   and unilaterally if necessary   to impose banking sanctions that will freeze the generals  bank accounts  These sanctions should at least be as robust as the financial sanctions imposed against North Korean leader Kim Jong Il s bank accounts in Macau      The U S  should push for an immediate U N  Security Council resolution that would impose a full arms embargo on Burma       The U N  should impose a visa ban on all those in the regime who are responsible for the crackdown       The U S  should increase its broadcasting into Burma and increase its assistance  channeled through organizations like the International Republican Institute  IRI   to aid the Burmese opposition       The U S  should ban all imports of Burmese gems and teak  which are not covered under current trade restrictions and which together provide millions for the junta  Additionally  the U S  should end the exception to its sanctions for Chevron  which operates a joint gas field project       The U S  should target intelligence resources to identify those responsible for the crackdown  murders and torture of peaceful Burmese activists       The U S  should press Thailand  which has major non NATO ally status with the United States  to join with Indonesia  Malaysia and others to demand a release of all Burmese political prisoners       China must realize its central role in effect supporting the Burmese massacre  and its importance to U S  Chinese relations  particularly ahead of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing  The U S  And the world must pressure China to stop its support of the regime in Burma and to support immediate U N  action against it       We should push India to immediately suspend all military sales to Burma and cancel all of its joint training and military operations       The next phase of political life in Burma has begun  The junta s thugs cannot forever postpone the blossoming of freedom and democracy                                            October 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
