Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement before the Committee on Commerce  Science  Transportation regarding an amendment he proposed to the Communications  Consumer s Choice  and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006 advocating cable channels to be offered on an a la carte basis   As many of my colleagues are aware  for almost ten years I have been advocating for broadcasters and cable companies that own cable channels to sell their channels individually to subscribers  also known as a la carte  to provide consumers with more control over the viewing options in their home and their monthly cable bill   Cable companies have resisted and continue to give consumers one option  buy a package of channels  whether you watch all the channels or not  The alternative is to not receive cable programming at all  Why have cable companies and cable programmers refused to give consumers the ability to buy and pay for only those channels consumers watch  Simply because they do not have to  They are the only game in town  But not for long  I hope  Telephone companies have realized that consumers want more and are poised to provide consumers across the nation with not only an alternative to the local cable company  but an alternative to buying a  bucket of channels    According to a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report  in communities where there are two cable companies competing for customers  cable rates are 15 percent less than in communities without any competition and in a few instances as much as an astounding 41 percent less  Unfortunately  today less then five percent of communities have two companies competing to provide consumers cable television service  But the Committee is acting to change that   A recent USA Today Gallup poll found that a majority of Americans would like to buy cable channels individually and an AP  Ipsos poll found that a remarkable 78 percent of Americans would like to do so  According to Nielsen Media Research  households receiving more than 70 channels only watch  on average  about 17 of these Consumers know that they could have greater control over their monthly bill if given the ability to choose their channels  This was recently confirmed by the FCC which found that many consumers could save as much as 13 percent on their monthly cable bills if they could buy individual channels   Can Committee members imagine the impact we could make on consumers  cable bills if consumers had not only a choice of providers  thereby lowering their bill at least 15 percent  but also a choice of channels  thereby lowering their bill another 13 percent   Consider the situation of a senior citizen on fixed income living in Sun City  Arizona  who watches only a few news and movie channels  but continues to pay for high priced channels such as ESPN  Fox Sports  and MTV  In fact  the general manager of the Sun City cable system has told my staff that he has tried to drop several expensive music video channels from the company s channel lineup to make room for channels his viewers want to receive and to decrease costs  but the owners of the music video channels have forbid him to do so without serious repercussions  So the residents of Sun City continue to subsidize the cost of these channels for viewers around the country  That is why the 35 million memebers of AARP supports a la carte channel choice   This amendment is NOT a mandate on cable providers  Instead it is designed to encourage choice and competition by granting significant regulatory relief to video service providers  such as telephone and cable companies  that agree to both offer cable channels on an a la carte basis to subscribers and to not prohibit any channel owned by the video service provider from being sold individually  In exchange  video service providers would receive the streamlined franchising process set forth in S  2686  Additionally  broadcasters that have own cable channels would get the protection of the broadcast flag if the broadcaster does not prohibit the cable channels from being sold individually   Contrary to what some might want the American people to believe  this amendment does not force cable companies or broadcasters to do a single thing  It is their choice whether to act or not act  The amendment provides them with such a choice even though they currently don t provide meaningful choices to their customers   I appreciate the Chairman putting a section in S  2686 supporting family tiers  but numerous family groups have stated that a la carte is preferable to the family tier concept and more likely to pass constitutional muster  In 2004  the FCC received 700 percent more cable indecency complaints than it received in 2003  A la carte channel selection would allow consumers the ability to combat cable indecency   Cable programmers and broadcasters have started offering individual television programs for download on the Internet  This is the purest form of a la carte  where one can watch and pay for only specific programs they choose  In addition  many of these same broadcasters and cable programmers make their channels available for individual purchase in Hong Kong  Canada  and other countries  Why do these cable programmers treat the American cable subscriber differently than a subscriber in Hong Kong or Canada or an Internet user  It remains unclear   This amendment is endorsed by Chairman Martin of the FCC  Parents Television Council  Consumers Union and the American Family Association  I hope the Committee votes with me to provide even MORE choice to consumers                                                      June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
