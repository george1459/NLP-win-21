                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN URGES FISCAL RESTRAINT AND GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN SPENDING January 18  2007 Washington  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following remarks regarding an amendment sponsored by Senator John Ensign  R NV  calling for greater transparency and enhanced Congressional oversight of spending  The measure  co sponsored by Senators McCain  R AZ  and DeMint  R NC   was agreed to and included in Senate bill 1       Mr  President  the underlying substitute does include two provisions that are intended to address the out of control earmarking and pork barrel spending of the past years  And  the adoption of the DeMint and Durbin amendments earlier this week have improved upon the underlying bill to ensure that all earmarks are disclosed     including those to federal entities  as well as all that are included in statements of managers and conference reports  A number of us supported a similar proposal last year  and I am pleased that the effort was finally successful      I am now pleased that additional improvements will be adopted with respect to Section 1 of the underlying bill concerning Out of Scope Matters in Conference Reports  The amendment sponsored by Senators Ensign  DeMint and myself  which I understand is agreeable on both sides  would ensure that Points of Order can be raised against specific items in conference reports  It would add a definition of    any matter   so that members are empowered to remove out of scope earmarks and policy riders from conference reports without taking down the entire conference report  And  importantly  it would ensure that funding associated with any provision stricken from a conference report is reduced from the total amount appropriated     a critical requirement missing from the underlying measure      For example  if a conference report provides  10 million for bridge improvements  but then adds a directive that  5 million of that funding should be directed to a specific bridge in a specific place     a directive that was not included in either the House or Senate Bill  our amendment would ensure the  5 million that accompanies that out of scope earmark is also removed from the total allocation of the bill  So that the total appropriated would be  5 million  not  10 million  This is about fiscal restraint  Mr  President  It makes little sense to raise a point of order that is sustained against an out of scope earmark  but to appropriate the funding regardless      While I support the improvements proposed and accepted so far  earmark reform still needs to go much further  We need to curtail earmarks  Mr  President  not just disclose them  The process is clearly broken when each year Congress continues to earmark billions and billions of taxpayer dollars  sometimes with virtually no information about the specifics of those earmarks  The scandal that came to light during the last Congress that involved earmarking by a former House member     now in prison     is a pox not just on him  but on each of us and the process that we have allowed to occur on our watch  The American public  Mr  President  deserves better  That is what this amendment is about      The growth in earmarked funding in appropriations bills during the past 12 years has been staggering  According to data gathered by CRS  there were 4 126 earmarks in 1994  In 2005  there were 15 877  an increase of nearly 400 percent  There was a little good news in 2006  solely due to the fact that the Labor HHS appropriations bill was approved almost entirely free of earmarks     an amazing feat given that there were over 3 000 earmarks the prior year for just that bill  Despite this first reduction in 12 years  it doesn   t change the fact that the largest number of earmarks in history have still occurred in the last three years   2004  2005  and 2006       Now  let   s consider the level of funding associated with those earmarks  The amount of earmarked funding increased from  23 2 billion in 1994 to  64 billion in FY 2006  Remarkably  it rose by 34 percent from 2005 to 2006  even though the number of earmarks decreased  Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000  and more than tripled in the last 10 years  This is wrong and disgraceful and we urgently need to curtail this seemingly out of control pork barreling practice that has become the norm around here       I filed an amendment designed to curtail earmarking  I was pleased to be joined by Senators Feingold and Graham in introducing amendment  29  Unfortunately  it is clear that we will not be given an opportunity to vote on that amendment and I find myself in the same position as I was in last March during debate on lobbying reform when I was not allowed a vote on my amendment  But one day soon  I am confident we will fundamentally change business as usual with respect to pork barrel spending  The American public has a powerful voice  and I would have thought more of us would have heard that voice last November  But  I do want to state my recognition that at least some improvements have been made to require full disclosure of all earmarks and to prevent out of scope matters in conference  And  I believe the Ensign  McCain  DeMint amendment makes further improvements                                                          January 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
