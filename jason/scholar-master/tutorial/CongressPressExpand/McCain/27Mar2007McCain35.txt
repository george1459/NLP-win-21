                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON FISCAL YEAR 2007 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT March 29  2007 Washington  D C      U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement regarding the Fiscal Year 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act    MR  McCAIN     Mr  President  this emergency supplemental appropriations bill contains  121 7 billion in funding  approximately  19 billion above the President   s request  and is replete with earmarks and other non emergency spending  Additionally  this bill would establish a timeline for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq  regardless of the conditions there  Such a mandate would have grave consequences for the future of Iraq  the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad  For these reasons  I do not support this bill       I support full funding for our troops in this time of war  and I believe that Congress  which authorized the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  is obligated to give American troops everything they need to prevail in their missions  Unfortunately  the must pass nature of this bill has proven all too tempting for Senators who could not restrain their profligate impulses to pile on spending unrelated to fighting the Global War on Terror      This bill exhibits little evidence that Congress respects the solemn responsibility to be custodians of the taxpayers    dollars  In a time of war  with large federal budget deficits  at a time when Americans deserve to keep more of their earnings at home  any rational observer would counsel restraint  Yet this emergency supplemental bill is stuffed with scarce dollars for the special interests  just as the measure approved by the House last week       The Dallas Morning News editorial board wrote last week with respect to the House passed bill that    turning the President   s  100 billion supplemental war spending request into a  124 6 billion  pork laden mess    is no way to show support for the troops  adding that    support for the troops takes the odd form of  25 million for spinach growers       1 48 billion for livestock farmers    and  74 million    to ensure the proper storage of peanuts             Unfortunately  the Senate has chosen to follow the House   s misguided lead by adding a host of non emergency and unrequested provisions to the measure pending before us   a measure that is desperately needed to fund the ongoing military missions       Let me mention some of the un requested items contained in this bill       3 million for sugar cane growers  of which the entire amount will go to one Hawaiian cooperative  Just last year Congress provided up to  40 million for Florida sugar cane growers in an emergency supplemental bill  I suppose no    emergency supplemental    bill is complete without a sweetener for sugar cane growers        165 9 million for fisheries disasters  Just last year Congress provided  95 million in another emergency supplemental bill to assist fishermen in recovering from fisheries disasters and to aid oyster bed and shrimp ground rehabilitation  This year  Congress    generous aid moved from the eastern seaboard to the west coast with over  60 million alone to assist salmon fishermen in Oregon and California        3 500 000 for the Capitol Guide Service and Special Services Office  to be available until September 2008  I was unaware that we had emergency tour guide needs in addition to our emergency troops    funding needs       13 million for research to develop mine safety technology  Congress provided  35 million in last year   s emergency supplemental bill to hire an additional 217 mine safety inspectors  and  10 million for mine safety research  so I must question why this latest funding cannot wait for the regular appropriations process        22 76 million for geothermal energy research  While I support renewable energy research to reduce our dependency on oil  this funding was not part of the Administration   s budget request  Does geothermal energy research qualify as emergency spending need  No  Mr  President  it does not       7 million for water quality research at pig farms in Missouri  Specifically  the bill directs the EPA to provide a  7 million grant to Water Environment Research Foundation in Alexandria  Virginia  to research water quality issues related to pig farms in Missouri  As many of us have stated  there is true    pork    in this bill as this earmark illustrates        2 million for the University of Vermont   s Educational Excellence Program  This project is essentially identical to an earmark that was proposed last year  It was rejected in last year   s final bill  and should not be included again this year         40 million for a    Tree Assistance Program     to aid    fruit and nut tree producers    and other producers of a    Christmas tree    or    potted shrub    or    ornamental tree     Mr  President  this bill is not only a big Christmas gift to special interests  but it also comes with a Christmas tree       95 millionto dairy producers       20 million for reimbursements to Nevada  Idaho and Utah for    insect damage    from grasshoppers  crickets and others  These pesky insects  Mr  President  are now richer than most residents in those states        24 million to sugar beet produces as compensation for production losses  These producers should be    beet red    over this handout      13 million for the Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention Program  Under this program  eligible livestock owners receive  18 for each qualifying ewe lamb  That means this provision would cover up to 722 222 sheep  Perhaps my colleagues think increasing our nation   s sheep stocks is somehow a viable alternative to the President   s troop increase in Iraq  I doubt the troops appreciate the priority that we   ve placed on ewe lambs breeding in this bill  It is a baa d earmark      6 million for crops damaged by floods in North Dakota  Yet another repeated attempt for funding that was rejected in last year   s emergency supplemental      5 million for irrigation repairs in Montana  Of the  35 million provided to the USDA Emergency Conservation Programs  which was not requested by the Administration  the bill earmarks  5 million for repairs to damaged irrigation ditches and pipelines in the State of Montana     30 million for the Farm Service Agency  Mr  President  on top of all the aforementioned programs  the bill provides  30 million for administration costs at the Farm Service Agency to ensure the federal government has enough employees to actually carry out all the new programs and new spending under this agriculture title  Here we see the underreported runaway effect of pork barrel politics  more pork translates into bigger government  bigger government means larger administrative overhead  and large administrative overhead means greater costs to American taxpayers       388 9 million for funding a backlog of old Department of Transportation highway projects  The taxpayers just provided over  24 billion in unauthorized highway projects in 2005  but Congress in its infinite wisdom has seen fit to provide another  388 million in this bill       This appropriations bill also includes numerous authorizing provisions  such as Section 3001  which uses the Emergency Supplemental to authorize certain outdoor signs that were damaged  abandoned  or discontinued as a result of a hurricane in certain regions to be repaired  replaced  or reconstructed within 24 months of enactment  The bill also restricts authorization to the Department of Transportation to implement a provision authorized by Congress in the North American Free Trade Agreement that would allow Mexican and U S  trucks to operate across the border  thereby facilitating free trade and benefiting the economy       Mr  President  once again the appropriators have included a massive agriculture disaster assistance package in the emergency supplemental  The language before us today is strikingly similar to language that appeared in the 2006 Emergency Supplemental and to an amendment that was rejected just last December  As my colleagues surely remember  the 2006 Senate passed Emergency Supplemental faced a veto threat because of the unrequested agricultural disaster package it contained  It faces the same threat today      Most shockingly still  Mr  President  the bill actually under funds the Army  Navy  Air Force  Marine Corps and Defense Wide Operation and Maintenance accounts by nearly  1 4 billion  withholding funds from accounts directly related to fulfilling the wartime needs of the military  This is disgraceful       Mr  President  this spending would be laughable if it weren   t so tragic  We are at war     a war that has cost us a great deal in blood and treasure and which inevitably will cost us more still  Our troops  who fight so bravely on our behalf and who so love their country that they are willing to sacrifice everything     everything     in order to defend it  show incredible courage in carrying out their duties in Iraq and Afghanistan  And so it is only right that we  the elected leaders entrusted to preserve the common welfare  show just a modicum of the sacrifice  courage  and restraint that these warriors exhibit every day      The Baltimore Sun editorialized last Sunday     President Bush requested that Congress quickly fund the troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and debate the war strategy separately  Yet Congress chose to hold troop funding hostage to pork barrel spending and to provide terrorists with a countdown clock to America   s exit from Iraq  Lawmakers must show that  past  promises of fiscal restraint were not meaningless by providing a clean bill for President Bush to sign  The troops deserve no less         I agree Mr  President  it is time to exercise the fiscal discipline commensurate with the responsibilities entrusted us by the American people and provide our troops with the support necessary to win the war in Iraq  This bill  which provides insufficient funding for our armed forces and a damaging withdrawal deadline  sends the wrong message to our troops  our enemies and the American taxpayer  The Dallas Morning News continued in its editorial      S etting an arbitrary date for withdrawal only handcuffs the troops trying to carry out their mission     and gives hope to their enemies     We hope     the supplemental war spending bill does not prove to be a reminder to Americans why the Constitution invested commander in chief responsibilities in one president  instead of 435 members of Congress         Mr  President  this bill will be vetoed and I will strongly support sustaining that veto  This bill is a perfect example of why I have long supported a President having line item veto authority     there is some necessary funding in this bill that is urgently needed to support our troops in Iraq  but unfortunately the bill is saddled with too much wasteful spending and a regrettable war strategy to allow me to support it                                                March 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
