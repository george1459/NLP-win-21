                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN STATEMENT ON ETHICS REFORM BILL  January 17  2007  Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following statement on the Senate floor regarding a bill calling for greater transparency in the legislative process and the creation of an Office of Public Integrity    Madame President  we as members of Congress owe the American people to conduct ourselves in a way that reinforces rather than diminishes the publics faith in Congress  An informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy and a democratic government operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye   In this bill  we have an opportunity to balance the right of the public to know with its right to petition government  the ability of lobbyists to advocate their clients  causes with the need for truthful public discourse and the ability of members to legislate with the imperative that our government must be free from corrupting influences  both real and perceived  We must act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the public s confidence in Congress does not become a collapse of confidence   I am pleased with the progress we have been making on this bill  We have been having a good debate on a range of proposals to further improve this bill  including requirements to rein in wasteful spending  such as by more fully disclosing earmarks and granting the President s enhanced rescission authority  We have recognized the need for increased disclosure and more timely reporting of lobbyist activities    And I am pleased we re considering an amendment   one that I fully support   to require members of Congress who use corporate aircraft to reimburse the full charter rate for a flight instead of simply paying the cost of a first class ticket  as required under the current rules  These are all solid proposals  Madam President  but we need to do more  And  Madam President  on the issue of first class air fare  I do not think there is a more dramatic example of the difference between we  members of Congress  and the average American citizen  No American citizen today can call up a corporation and say  please let me use your airplane and  by the way  I m only going to pay first class air fare  Nothing is more egregious   Are their worse abuses that go on around here  But there is no more egregious example than the ability of a member of Congress  who many times has oversight of the corporation that provides the aircraft  taking advantage of a situation where they only have to pay first class air fare   air fare  with a difference of sometimes tens of thousands of dollars  It is remarkable  We need to reform earmarking beyond mere disclosure requirements  We need to curtail this practice  which cost American taxpayers  64 billion in fiscal year 2006  And I have offered an amendment to help do that   Above all  we need to ensure the enactment and enforcement of comprehensive lobbyist ethics and earmark reforms  That is why we need to establish an Office of Public Integrityto help provide enforcement measures for the reforms that we are advocating  We can pass all the rules changes we want  but unless we back them up with a tough enforcement mechanism  they are useless   On the issue of earmarks  Madam President   and I obviously have a long record of being opposed to these egregious examples of pork barreling   I think that it is important for us to recognize that there are two ways we can address earmarking  One is to eliminate them andthe other is to watch them grow  And over the previous 20 years  I have watched them grow and grow and grow   I was intrigued by getting a call from an administration official who says the President is for cutting them in half  That is like saying we want to cut half the drug dealers in America  There is an addiction in Congress to pork barreling and we have got to cure the addiction or it will continue to grow  It is because of this need that I am pleased to again join my colleagues  Senator Lieberman and Collins  in co sponsoring an amendment to create an Office of Public Integrityto investigate complaints of ethical violations by senators  staff or officers of this chamber  Headed by a director appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate  upon the joint recommendation of the majority and minority leaders  the Office of Public Integrity would investigate complaints of rules violations filed with or initiated by the office  To ensure swift action within 30 days of receiving a complaint  the office would be required to make an initial determination of whether to dismiss or investigate it   Although a determination by the office to investigate may be overridden by the Select Committee on Ethics  the amendment stipulates that this can only occur if the Ethics Committee overrides the decision by a two thirds vote and makes this vote public  To assist in its investigation  the office would be empowered to issue subpoenas  take statements  and compel the attendance of witnesses  If after investigation  the director of the office determines that there is probable cause that a violation occurred  he or she must inform the Ethics Committee  which again  can decide not to proceed on a complaint  but only upon a two thirds vote that must be made public   If the Ethics Committee does not overrule the office s determination of probable cause  the office shall present the case to the Ethics Committee which shall vote on whether the subject of the investigation violated any rules or other standards  Again  this vote must be made public  If the Ethics Committee finds that there was a violation  the Director of the Office of Public Integrity shall recommend appropriate sanctions and whether the matter should be referred to the Department of Justice for investigation   Madam President  for two years  the Committee on Indian Affairs  which I chaired at the time  investigated the actions of Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon and brought to light their efforts to manipulate the political process  If there is a silver lining to the Abramoff affair  it is that it helped to compel Congress to reassess the rules that govern our dealings with lobbyists and others who seek to influence us and do so through the eyes of the public  not through our own jaundiced perspectives  Frankly  I also believe the American public sent a clear message that business as usual is an unacceptable proposition  And that is what drives our amendment today   Again  I want to point out that we  the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs  investigated Mr  Abramoff and his connection with frankly both sides of the Capitol  and there was never an Ethics Committee investigation  It was the Justice Department that finally had to take action  There was ample evidence of misbehavior and violation of the rules of both houses and here we are with people in jail  and as far as I know  the Ethics Committee never ruled on their behavior   So when I hear people say  Well  the Office of Public Integrity would somehow cause us embarrassment  aren t we embarrassed by what is already happened  Aren t we embarrassed that members of Congress violated their oath of office to the degree that they are in jail and the investigations continue on the part of the Justice Department  I say to the opponents of this amendment  in a perfect world  maybe you are right  In the world that we live in to today  you are not right  We owe the American public a better system than the one that has been in place for the past several years   While strengthening the Senate rules regarding disclosure  gifts  meals  travel and post employment lobbying is necessary and overdue  it is also of little importance if the rules are not enforced  Instances of apparent violations of congressional rules by members and staff who were the beneficiaries of Mr  Abramoff s largess were widely reported  Press accounts of luxury trips  high priced tickets to sporting events  meals at expensive restaurants and other gifts suggest that there had been flagrant  if not widespread  violation of our rules and that these violations had been occurring for some time   As a columnist and scholar Norm Ornstein has observed  Congress has regularly struggled with its constitutional responsibility to police itself  sometimes verging on partisan vendettas  what we called in the 1980 s and 1990 s  the criminalization of partisan differences   but more often erring on the side of doing nothing  as little as humanly possible to deal with ethical violations  At a time when the public is demanding change  the Senate needs to more aggressively enforce its own rules  We should do this not just by making more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee currently undertakes  but by addressing the conflict that is inherent in anybody that regulates itself  By creating  as this amendment would do  a new office with the capacity to conduct and initiate investigations and a perspective uncolored by bipartisan concerns or collegial relationships  I believe we can address this long standing structural problem   The amendment strikes a good balance by keeping with the Select Committee on Ethics the final decisions on whether to conduct an investigation  whether a violation has occurred  and whether to refer to the Department of Justice while adding an independent voice to the process to ensure that the reputation of the institution is not sacrificed for the understandable concern for the reputation of one s friends and colleagues  The Office of Public Integrity would not only assist in performing existing investigative functions  but would also be charged with the new function of approving or denying requests for travel by members and staff   The purpose of this pre clearance is to ensure that the trips serve a legitimate government interest and are not substantially recreational in nature  I believe that the Office of Public Integrity would be an appropriate entity to conduct these reviews   I urge the majority and minority leaders to allow an up or down vote on this amendment  The American public is watching  Madam President  there are many organizations that are observing our activities here and I think  as I said earlier  we can be pleased at some of the progress we are making  But this will be a seminal vote  This will be an indication of whether we are really seriousabout making sure that decisions made by the Ethics Committee are untainted by personal relationships or by other factors   I think it is long overdue  And I want to point out again  the exit polling from the 2006 election  There were two major issues that affected the voters  opinion and their vote  One  as we all know  was the war in Iraq   The other was the issue of corruption in Washington  The American public is very dissatisfied with the way Congress conducts its business   I have seen polls of their approval rating of Congress in the low twenties and even in the high teens  They do not think we conduct our business in an honest and straightforward manner and they believe that the special interests have way too much influence in determining both our priorities and the outcome of our legislation  I believe  Madam President  that the Lieberman amendment can go a long way towards restoring the very badly tarnished image of the Congress of the United States  I thank the President
