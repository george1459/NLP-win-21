                                                                                                                         MCCAIN INTRODUCES BILL TO STOP THE ONLINE EXPLOITATION OF OUR CHILDREN December 6  2006 Washington D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today introduced the Stop the Online Exploitation of Our Children Act and submitted the following remarks regarding his legislation for the record    Mr  President  today I am introducing the Stop the Online Exploitation of Our Children Act of 2006  This legislation would reduce the sexual exploitation of our children  and punish those who cause them physical and emotional harm through sex crimes    Twenty two years ago  President Ronald Reagan inaugurated the opening of the  National Center  for Missing and Exploited Children  known as NCMEC  At a White House ceremony  he called on the Center to wake up America and attack the crisis of child victimization  Today  thanks to the efforts of NCMEC and many others in the public and private sectors  America is more conscious of the dangers of child exploitation  but our children still face significant threats from those who see their innocence as an opportunity to do harm  The continuing victimization of our children is readily and all too painfully apparent in the resurgence of child pornography in our world    In recent years  technology has contributed to the greater distribution and availability  and  some believe  desire for child pornography  I say child pornography  but that label does not describe accurately what is at issue  As emphasized by a recent Department of Justice report  child pornography does not come close to describing these images  which are nothing short of recorded images of child sexual abuse  These images are  quite literally  digital evidence of violent sexual crimes perpetrated against the most vulnerable among us    Mr  President  experts are also finding that the images of child sexual exploitation produced and distributed today involve younger and younger children  As emphasized by NCMEC  83 percent of offenders surveyed in a recent study were caught with images of children younger than 12 years old  Thirty nine percent had images of children younger than six  Almost 20 percent had images of children younger than three  These are not normal criminals  and I cannot fathom the extent of the physical and emotional harm they cause their victims    The violence of the images continues to increase as well  Dr  Sharon Cooper  a nationally recognized expert on this subject  stated before a September Senate Commerce Committee hearing that the images often depict sadistic gross sexual assault and sodomy  This view was underscored by Mike Brown  the Sheriff of Bedford County  Virginia  and the Director of the Blue Ridge Thunder Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force  who also testified to his direct experience with increasingly violent and disturbing images of child sexual exploitation    The Federal government has in place a system for online companies such as Internet service providers to report these images to NCMEC  The Center is directed by law to relay that information to Federal and State law enforcement agencies  This reporting system has been successful  but it is in need of several vital improvements   The bill would enhance the current reporting system by expanding the range of companies obligated to report child pornography to NCMEC  stating specifically what information must be reported to the Center  moving the reporting obligations into the Federal criminal code  imposing higher penalties on companies that do not report child pornography to NCMEC in the manner required by law  and providing greater legal certainty around the child pornography reporting requirement    As suggested by NCMEC  the reporting of child pornography should be more widespread  To that end  the bill would expand and clarify the types of online companies that would be obligated to report child pornography to the Center  Today  Federal law requires electronic communication service providers and providers of remote computing services to report child pornography they discover to NCMEC through the Centers CyberTipline  However  what types of companies fall into each category is sometimes unclear  To better define and expand the types of online companies obligated to report child pornography  the legislation would require a broad range of online service providers  including web hosting companies  domain name registrars  and social networking sites  to report child pornography to NCMEC    Another weakness in the current reporting system is that the law does not say exactly what information should be reported to NCMEC  This failure to set forth specific reporting requirements makes the current statute both difficult to comply with and tough to enforce  and this omission may have led to less effective prosecution of child pornographers  According to testimony submitted by the Center to the Senate Commerce Committee  because there are no guidelines for the contents of these reports  some  companies  do not send customer information that allows NCMEC to identify a law enforcement jurisdiction  So potentially valuable investigative leads are left to sit in the CyberTipline database with no action taken  This is unacceptable  Mr  President  The bill would cure this problem by requiring that reporting companies convey to the Center a defined set of information  which is in large part the information that is provided to NCMEC today by the nations leading Internet service providers  Among other things  the bill would require online service providers to report specific information about the individual involved in producing  distributing  or receiving child pornography such as that individuals e mail address  In addition  it would require reporting companies to NCMEC geographic location of the involved individual such as the individuals physical address and the IP address from which the individual connected to the Internet   Mr  President  to ensure that law enforcement officials have better odds of prosecuting involved individuals  the bill would also require online service providers to preserve all data that they report to NCMEC for at least 180 days  and to not knowingly destroy any other information that they posses that relates to a child pornography incident reported to NCMEC    The legislation would help ensure greater compliance with the child pornography reporting requirements under Federal law by increasing three fold the penalties for knowing failure to report child pornography to NCMEC  It would also move the reporting requirement from title 42  which relates to the publics health and welfare  to title 18  our Federal criminal code  This is to underscore that a breach of the reporting obligations is a violation of criminal law  In addition  the Act would eliminate the legal liability of online service providers for actions taken to comply with the child pornography reporting requirements    The bottom line  Mr  President  is that this legislation should result in more thorough reporting of child pornography to NCMEC  I expect that more and better information provided to the Center will lead to a greater number of prosecutions and enhanced protection of our children  As stated by NCMEC  with improvements to the reporting system there would be more reports that are actionable by law enforcement  which will lead to more prosecutions and convictions and  more importantly  to the rescue of more children    In addition to the provisions relating to child pornography  the bill also would ensure that sex offenders will register information relevant to their online activities on sex offender registries  Specifically  it would require sex offenders to register their email addresses  as well as their instant messaging and chat room handles and any other online identifiers they use  If a sex offender failed to do so  he could be prosecuted  convicted  and thrown into jail for up to 10 years  The bill would also make the use of the Internet in the commission of a crime of child exploitation an aggravating factor that would add 10 years to the offenders sentence    Mr  President  to help address the international nature of child pornography  the bill would permit NCMEC to share reports with foreign law enforcement agencies  subject to approval by the Department of Justice  In addition  the Act would state the sense of Congress that the executive branch should make child pornography a priority when engaging in negotiations or talks with foreign countries    Finally  the Act would authorize  20 3 million for our Nations Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces  This increase of  5 million above that currently requested by the Administration is recommended by NCMEC  Sheriff Brown  and others who believe that the additional amount would significantly improve the efforts of these teams of Federal  State  and local law enforcement officials dedicated to identifying and prosecuting those who use the Internet to prey upon our Nations children    Mr  President  protecting our children is a top priority for members of Congress  regardless of party affiliation  This legislation would help us achieve that goal  I look forward to working with my colleagues to debate and move this bill through the legislative process during the next Congress                                                         December 2006 Press Releases           Browse
