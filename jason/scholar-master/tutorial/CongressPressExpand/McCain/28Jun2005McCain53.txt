                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON THE RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O CONNOR July 1  2005 The following is a floor statement delivered by Senator John McCain on the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O Connor    Mr  President  today we have learned that one of our nation s finest jurists will step down from our highest court  Despite her departure from the Supreme Court  Justice Sandra Day O Connor will leave a lasting mark on American jurisprudence characterized by fairness  balance  and integrity   Justice O Connor s career and service to our nation have been truly remarkable  This country will miss her presence on the Supreme Court dearly   Some have said that no other individual in our nation s history has come to the Supreme Court under greater expectations  Not only did Justice O Connor meet these expectations  she far exceeded them  When President Reagan nominated and the Senate unanimously confirmed Justice O Connnor in 1981  she became the first woman to sit on the Supreme Court and  over time  she grew to be one of the crucial swing votes on the court  her decisions driven both by her conservative sensibilities and also by her practical nature   Justice O Connor grew up on the Lazy B Cattle Ranch in southeastern Arizona  She learned to drive at age seven and could fire rifles and ride horses by the time she turned eight  Perhaps it was her Arizona roots that fueled both her pragmatism and her desire to succeed   Mr  President  after high school  Justice O Connor attended Stanford University where she majored in economics and graduated with high honors  A legal dispute over her family s ranch  however  inspired her interest in law and her decision to enroll at Stanford Law School  Justice O Connor completed law school in only two years  but she still managed to serve on the Stanford Law Review and receive highest honors  O Connor graduated third out of a class of 102  First in the class was fellow Arizonan William H  Rehnquist  I would suggest  Mr  President  that maybe we should turn to Arizona once again to for a Supreme Court nominee  considering the track records of Justices O Connor and Rehnquist   In law school  Justice O Connor also met her future husband  John Jay O Connor  a fine man and husband   Mr  President  Justice O Connor faced a difficult job market after leaving Stanford  No law firm in California wanted to hire her and only one offered her a position as a legal secretary  Later  in Arizona  she again found it difficult to obtain a position with any law firm  so she started her own firm  It is truly remarkable to realize just how far Justice O Connor has risen during her life despite the adversity she has faced   After she gave birth to her second son  Justice O Connor withdrew from her professional life to care for her children  Nevertheless  she became involved in many volunteer activities during this time  She also began an involvement with the Arizona Republican Party  After five years as a full time mother  Justice O Connor returned to work as an assistant State Attorney General in Arizona  Arizona Governor Jack Williams later appointed her to occupy a vacant seat in the Arizona Senate  O Connor successfully defended her Senate position for two more terms and eventually became the majority leader  By rising to the position of majority leader  Justice O Connor achieved another first for American women   In 1974  Justice O Connor ran and won a judgeship on the Maricopa County Superior Court  which resulted in her service in all three branches of Arizona government  A year later  she was nominated to serve on to the Arizona Court of Appeals  Almost two years after that  President Reagan nominated her to the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Justice Potter Stewart  The Senate rightly confirmed O Connor s nomination unanimously and the Court soon abandoned its use of Mr  Justice as the form of address  Justice O Connor herself described the significance of her nomination in the following way  She said  A woman had never held a position at that level of our government  And it was a signal that it was all right that women could be in such positions  That they could do well in such positions   Mr  President  Justice O Connor brought to her position on the Supreme Court her remarkable life history characterized by independence  perseverance  and achievement  Early in her tenure on the Court  observers identified her as part of the Court s conservative faction  The public often associated her with Justice Rehnquist because of their shared roots and values  Over time  though  Justice O Connor combined her conservative sensibilities with a desire to find pragmatic solutions based on sound legal interpretation  She approached each case thoughtfully   It will be difficult to fill the void that Justice O Connor s resignation has created  nor can anyone assume a similar place in American history  There can be only one first  and Sandra Day O Connor was it                                                     July
