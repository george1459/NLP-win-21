Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  introduced the Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment  CHOICE  Act of 2006  The bill is designed to encourage broadcasters and cable companies that own cable channels to sell their channels individually to subscribers  It also promotes cable channel distribution over the Internet   Below is Senator McCain s floor statement that was submitted for the record today  the bill summary  and a copy of the of the opinion editorial by Senator McCain and FCC Chairman Martin as it appeared in the Los Angeles Times on May 25  2006  Attached is a copy of the legislation            STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CONSUMERS HAVING OPTIONS IN CABLE ENTERTAINMENT  CHOICE  ACT OF 2006  June 7  2006  MR  MCCAIN  Mr  President  today I am introducing the Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment  CHOICE  Act of 2006  This bill would encourage broadcasters and cable companies that own cable channels to sell their channels individually to subscribers  It would also promote cable programming distribution over the Internet   For almost ten years I have supported giving consumers the ability to buy cable channels individually  also known as a la carte  to provide consumers with more control over the viewing options in their home and their monthly cable bill  Cable companies have resisted this and have continued to give consumers all the  choice  of a North Korean election ballot  There is only one option available  buy a package of channels  whether you watch all the channels or not  The alternative is to not receive cable programming at all  Why have cable companies and cable programmers refused to give consumers the ability to buy and pay for only those channels consumers watch  Simply because they do not have to  They are the only game in town  But not for long  I hope   Telephone companies have realized that consumers want more and are poised to provide consumers across the nation with an alternative to the local cable company  Many of these telephone companies  including ATT  are also ready to offer consumers the ability to purchase channels a la carte  Such companies will offer two crucial benefits to consumers  more competition in the video service provider market  and more options for programming packages  Together  these two offerings will allow consumers to have greater control over the content that enters the home and the ability to manage their monthly cable bills   According to a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report  in communities where there are two cable companies competing for customers  cable rates are 15 percent less than in communities without any competition  A subsequent GAO study suggests that in some markets the presence of another cable competitor may reduce rates by an astounding 41 percent  Unfortunately  today less then five percent of communities have two companies competing to provide consumers cable television service   The CHOICE Act would help bring competition to the cable television market  Choice in cable television delivery is long overdue for consumers who have suffered steep rate hikes year after year  Since 1996  cable rates have increased 58 percent or nearly three times the rate of inflation  The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  has found that rates increased seven percent in 2001 and 2002  and five percent in 2003  The FCC s most recent report found that rates again rose five percent in 2004  double the rate of inflation  but only 3 6  where the local cable company faced competition  I can only imagine the savings consumers could reap if presented with a choice of providers of cable service and a choice of channels  For this reason I call on Congress to pass the CHOICE Act   A recent USA Today Gallup poll found that a majority of Americans would like to buy cable channels individually and an AP  Ipsos poll found that a remarkable 78 percent of Americans would like to do so  According to Nielsen Media Research  households receiving more than 70 channels only watch  on average  about 17 of these  Consumers know that they could have greater control over their monthly bill if given the ability to choose their channels  This was recently confirmed by the FCC  This year the FCC found that consumers could save as much as 13 percent on their monthly cable bills if they could buy only the channels they want   Mr  President  consider the situation of a senior citizen on fixed income living in Sun City  Arizona  who watches only a few news and movie channels  but continues to pay for high priced channels such as ESPN  Fox Sports  and MTV   channels that other consumers enjoy  but channels that certain seniors may not want and possibly cannot afford  In fact  the general manager of the Sun City cable system has told my staff that he has tried to drop several expensive music video channels from the company s channel lineup to make room for channels his viewers want to receive and to decrease costs  but the owners of the music video channels have forbid him to do so without serious repercussions  So the residents of Sun City continue to subsidize the cost of these channels for viewers around the country  That is why AARP  representing 35 million senior citizens  supports the ability for viewers to buy channels on an a la carte basis  But again  cable companies don t have to listen to these 35 million viewers because there is no real threat of losing them  They have nowhere to turn   The CHOICE ACT  Mr  President  is not a mandate on cable providers  Instead it is designed to encourage choice and competition by granting significant regulatory relief to video service providers  such as telephone and cable companies  that agree to both offer cable channels on an a la carte basis to subscribers and to not prohibit any channel owned by the video service provider from being sold individually  In exchange  video service providers would receive the right to obtain a national franchise  would be permitted to pay lower fees to municipalities for the use of public rights of way  would benefit from a streamlined definition of  gross video revenue  for the calculation of such fees  and would gain a prohibition on the solicitation of institutional networks  in kind donation  and unlimited public access channels   In addition  broadcasters that have an ownership stake in a cable channel would get the benefit of the FCC s network non duplications rule if the broadcaster does not prohibit the channel from being sold individually  The FCC s network non duplication rule provides exclusivity for broadcasters by not allowing another broadcaster with the same network affiliation from broadcasting in the same community  The bill would also modify Section 616 a  of the Communications Act that currently prohibits video service providers from using coercion or retaliatory tactics to prevent cable channels from making their services available to competing companies to extend this provision to distribution over the Internet   For example  if Time Warner Cable offered CNN  a cable channel it owns  on an a la carte basis to its cable subscribers and allowed other cable companies  satellite companies  and video programmers who choose to distribute CNN to make it available on an a la carte basis  Time Warner Cable would be eligible for a national franchise and other regulatory relief  If Disney  which owns ESPN  allowed other cable companies  satellite companies  and video programmers who choose to distribute ESPN to make it available on an a la carte basis  the Disney s ABC broadcast stations would have the benefit of the FCC s network non duplication rule   Mr  President  contrary to what some might want the American people to believe  the CHOICE Act does not force video service providers or broadcasters to do a single thing  It is their choice whether to act or not act  The bill provides them with such a choice even though they currently don t provide meaningful choices to their customers  This bill is incentive based legislation that would encourage owners of cable channels to make channels available for individual purchase and would do nothing to prevent cable companies from continuing to offer a bundle of channels or tiers of channels   The cable industry regularly touts the value of its package of channels  noting that it costs less than taking a family of four to a movie or professional sporting event  However  watching cable television is not always a family event  Several channels have programming that consumers find objectionable or that parents believe is unsuitable for young children  Complaints about indecent cable programming have increased exponentially in recent years  In 2004  the FCC received 700 percent more cable indecency complaints than it received in 2003  Most of the cable programs about which indecency complaints have been filed with the FCC aired during hours when many children are watching television   Cable and satellite companies currently provide subscribers with a variety of methods of blocking the audio and video programming of any channel that they do not wish to receive  However  subscribers are still required to pay for these channels that they find objectionable  The  v chip  does not effectively protect children from indecent programming carried by video programming distributors  Most of the television sets currently in use in the United States are not equipped with a v chip  of the 280 million sets currently in United States households  approximately 161 million television sets are not equipped with a v chip  Households that have a television set with a v chip are also likely to have one or more sets that are not equipped with a v chip   Again  Mr  President  I am aware that not all consumers want to block and not pay for certain channels  but shouldn t all consumers should have the choice to do so  Cable programmers and broadcasters have started offering individual television programs for download on the Internet  This is the purest form of a la carte   where one can watch and pay for only specific programs they choose  In addition  many of these same broadcasters and cable programmers make their channels available for individual purchase in Hong Kong  Canada  and other countries  Why do these cable programmers treat the American cable subscriber differently than a subscriber in Hong Kong or Canada or an Internet user  It remains unclear   Lastly  Mr  President  I know that the cable programmers and broadcasters will not be the only group that may have some concerns with this bill  Many of my friends in local government are also likely to be interested in the reduced  rights of way  fee and streamlined definition of  gross video revenue  under this bill  Cable companies pay these fees to municipalities to use the right of way land under sidewalks  streets and bridges to reach customers  homes and then pass these fees on to subscribers  However  these fees often surpass the costs of managing  rights of way  land and municipalities use these funds for other expenditures  Just last month at a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee  Michael A  Guido  Mayor of Dearborn  Michigan  confirmed that these fees are often used to pay for other city expenses  such as emergency vehicles   In 2004  state and local governments collected approximately  2 4 billion in these fees  slightly more than  37 per year from every household subscriber  Americans for Tax Reform believes that the  franchise fee is just a stealth tax on our consumption of the cable television   as do other economists and tax payer advocacy groups  To this end  the legislature in my home state of Arizona just recently passed a bill to reduce such fees and taxes on cable television subscribers   The Phoenix Center  a non partisan legal and economic think tank  has found that the introduction of competition to cable companies could allow the fee to be lowered  significantly without doing any harm to local governments   Based upon this research  the CHOICE Act would reduce the fee from 5 percent to 3 7 percent for eligible video service providers and allow local governments to petition the FCC for a higher fee if it is necessary to cover the costs of managing  rights of way  land  I believe this would provide some real cost savings to cable subscribers   I remain open to working with municipalities on this issue and look forward to working with all interested parties to ensure that American consumers receive greater options for affordable and acceptable television viewing  Mr  President  I hope the introduction of the CHOICE Act furthers the debate on the issue of a la carte channel selection and I look forward to the Senate s consideration of the bill    Summary   The CHOICE Act   Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act   This bill would grant significant regulatory relief to video service providers who agree to both offer cable channels on an a la carte basis to subscribers and not prohibit any channel owned by the video service provider from being sold individually   In exchange for offering consumers cable channels on an a la carte basis  video service providers would receive the right to obtain a national franchise  would be permitted to pay lower fees to municipalities for the use of public rights of way  would benefit from a streamlined definition of  gross video revenue  for the calculation of such fees  and would gain a prohibition on the solicitation of institutional networks  in kind donation  and unlimited PEG channels   Broadcasters with an ownership stake in a cable channel would get the benefit of the FCC s network non duplication rule if the broadcaster does not prohibit the channel from being sold individually  Lastly  the bill would extend Section 616 a  of the Communications Act to extend this provision to distribution over the Internet   Below is a more detailed summary of the bill   Section One  Sets forth the title of the bill   Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act    Section Two  Defines the terms  a la carte    video service    video service provider  and  eligible video service provider    o A  video service provider  is defined as a provider of video services that uses a public right of way  This definition would cover all wired providers  including cable companies and telephone companies such as Comcast  Cox  Verizon  and ATT  This definition would not apply to direct broadcast satellite  DBS  providers such as Dish Network and DirecTV who are not required to seek a franchise under current law   o An  eligible video service provider  is defined as    1  a video service provider that  i  has an attributable interest in a cable channel offered on the basic tier of a digital cable system   ii  makes available that cable channel available to its subscribers individually   iii  does not prohibit other providers from offering this channel individually and  iv  files with the FCC a declaration of its intent to offer its subscribers on an individual basis any cable channel provided to it on an individual basis   OR   2  a video service provider that does not have an attributable interest in a cable channel and files with the FCC a declaration of its intent to offer its subscribers on an individual basis any cable channel provided to it on an individual basis    Section Three  Sets forth the regulatory relief for Eligible Video Service Providers   o Dissolution of a local franchise  in favor of a national franchise   o Termination of a  franchise fee  set at 5  of gross revenues in favor of a  rights of way fee  set at 3 7  of  gross video revenues    o Prohibition on in kind contributions or institutional networks  unless such donations are credited against the calculation of  gross video revenues    o Streamlining of definition of  gross video revenues  from current statutory definition of  gross revenues    o Establishment of a dispute resolution process for disputes regarding the use of a municipalities   rights of way    o Modification of FCC s rules on  public  educational  or governmental   PEG  channels to require video service providers to make available at least three PEG channels and to necessitate municipalities who program PEG channels to provide at least eight hours of programming a day with four hours of non repeat programming  and   o Establishes an effective date of six months after enactment   Section Four  This section states that broadcasters with an ownership stake in a cable channel would get the benefit of the FCC s network non duplication rule only if the broadcaster permits the cable channel to be sold individually  The FCC s network non duplication rule states that upon the request of a local television station with exclusive rights to distribute a network or syndicated program  a cable operator generally may not carry a duplicating program broadcast by a distant station  The Commission s rules generally provide stations such protection within a station s 35 mile geographic zone   Section Five  Amends Section 616 a  of the Communications Act that currently prohibits video service providers from using coercion to prevent cable channels from making their services available to competing companies to extend the prohibition to other distribution systems  including the Internet   Section Six  This section states that the FCC has the authority to prescribe any rules and regulations to carry out the CHOICE Act   Section Seven  Sets forth a severability clause     Los Angeles Times  May 25  2006 Thursday  Home Edition  SECTION  CALIFORNIA  Metro  Editorial Pages Desk  Part B  Pg  11  LENGTH  624 words  HEADLINE  TV served a la carte  BYLINE  John McCain and Kevin Martin  SEN  JOHN MCCAIN  R Ariz   is introducing the CHOICE Act  KEVIN MARTIN is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission   BODY   AMERICAN consumers have little choice when it comes to cable television  If you want ESPN  you must pay for 60 plus channels that you may never watch  If your child loves Nickelodeon  your family must pay for the same 60 plus channels  some of which may not be suitable for young children  Now  imagine deciding for yourself which TV channels you want to purchase  You could select the channels you want to pay for  and opt out of those you don t  In fact  right now millions of TV viewers outside the U S  have these choices  They buy their television channels individually or in smaller bundles    and get better deals as a result   Why can t Americans do this now  Because there is too little competition  too much regulation and not enough consumer choice in the cable TV business  As a result  in just the last two years alone cable prices have increased at twice the rate of inflation    and more than 90  since 1995  Cable companies explain away their skyrocketing prices by saying they are giving you more and more channels  At no time  however  have the cable companies actually asked if you want those additional channels  You have to pay for them whether you want them or not   The solution to high cable bills isn t price controls or additional government regulation  It is more competition and more choice  For that reason  Congress should pass the proposed Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act    the CHOICE Act    which is being introduced today  It would allow cable companies to compete nationally for your business  rather than only at the local level  in exchange for agreeing to offer channels a la carte  either individually or in smaller bundles   The Government Accountability Office has found that cable rates are 15  lower when a community has at least two companies competing for consumers  The Federal Communications Commission found that consumers could lower their monthly cable bill by as much as 13  if they had a la carte programming options   And parents would never be forced to purchase a slew of channels  some not suitable for young children  simply to receive those channels that their family enjoys watching together   Real world examples illustrate the benefits of greater choice and more competition coming through our TV sets  In Hong Kong  viewers can select and pay for only the channels they want  A family that wants to watch sports  movies  news and children s programming can receive 15 free channels plus a selection of 11 additional digital channels  including ESPN  HBO  CNN Headline News  National Geographic Channel  Animal Planet and Discovery Channel  for only  27 50 a month  To get a package that includes those channels in Washington  the cost is  82 per month    almost  1 000 a year  That s quite a difference   Similarly  in Canada  digital subscribers can buy channels individually or enjoy significant savings on a 5 pack  a 10 pack or a 15 pack of their own choosing   Interestingly  the same companies that oppose selling channels individually or in smaller packages in the U S  offer their programming a la carte in other countries  Their threats of financial ruin and a loss of diverse programming have proved hollow  American consumers want these companies to offer such choices  According to a recent AP Ipsos poll  78  of respondents said they would prefer to choose and pay for their own tailored selection of channels   Today  cable choice and competition have been successful around the world  Consumers in Hong Kong  Britain  India and Canada are reaping the rewards of greater choice from channels being offered on an a la carte basis  So why not increase competition in the U S  and at the same time make sure that companies offer us true choice in cable programming                                              June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
