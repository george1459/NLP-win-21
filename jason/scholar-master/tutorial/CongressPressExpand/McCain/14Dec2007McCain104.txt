                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN STATEMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 December 18  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Recordon H R  2764  the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008    Mr  President  Fiscal Year 2008 began seventy  nine days ago  And yet here we are at the end of the calendar year   with Christmas one week away   and everyone scrambling to finally get our work done and get out of town  This process  and the monstrosity it has produced  is the height of irresponsibility  We owe the taxpayer more than this   In the past  I have stood here on the Senate floor to speak about how our economic situation and our vital national security concerns require us to take greater effort in prioritizing our federal spending and that we could no longer afford  literally  business as usual  Actually  Mr  President  what we have before us is even worse than business as usual because the bill we received from the House provides not a single penny to fund our ongoing mission in Iraq  We are at war and our men and women serving in Iraq today continue to face a fierce and determined enemy   and this bill does not fund their mission  The omission of Iraq funding is no more than a political stunt   and we all know it  What kind of message does this send to those brave men and women in the field Mr  President   Unfortunately  little has changed over the years  Mr  President  Here we are again  nearly three full months into fiscal year 2008  and we have before us another appropriations monster  Let me remind my colleagues that  because of our inability to get much done around here under the regular order  we have been forced to consider huge omnibus appropriations bills and one long term continuing resolution in five of the last six fiscal years    The bill before us today is more than 1 400 pages long and is accompanied by a joint explanatory statement that was so big they couldnt even number the pages  This bill consolidates 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills with a price tag of nearly  475 billion  Amazingly  Mr  President  this bill contains 9 170 earmarks  Add those to the 2 161 earmarks that were contained in the defense appropriations bill and the grand total for FY 08 earmarks stands at 11 331 unnecessary  wasteful  run of the mill pork barrel projects  And that is just for the House  and Senate passed bill   I can only imagine what this will look like when it comes out of conference    A New York Times CBS News poll that was released today shows that the approval rating of Congress stands at 21   Can we blame the American people for holding us in such low esteem  Lets look at how were spending their hard earned tax dollars    Here is just a sampling of some of the earmarks contained in this bill   150 000 for the STEEED  Soaring Toward Educational Enrichment via Equine Discovery  Youth Program in Washington  DC  Basically   this is an earmark of  150 000 so that disadvantaged kids can ride horses    50 000 for the construction of a National Mule and Packers Museum in Bishop  CA   100 000 for Cooters Pond Park in Prattville  AL   625 000 for the Historic Congressional Cemetery right here on Capitol Hill   1 95 million for the City College of NY for the Charles B  Rangel Center for Public Service    975 000 for the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas  Little Rock  AR   1 628 million for animal vaccines in Greenport  NY   477 000 for Barley Health Food Benefits in Beltsville  MD    244 000 for Bee Research in Weslaco  TX   10 million to Nevada for the design and construction of the Derby Dam fish screen to allow passage of fish   1 6 million for sensitivity training for law enforcement in Los Angeles   1 786 million to develop an exhibit for the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Michigan    846 000 to the Fathers Day Rally Committee in Philadelphia  PA   125 000 for International Mothers Day Shrine in Grafton  WV    470 000 for an Oyster Hatchery Economic Pilot Program  Morgan State University  MD   446 500 for Horseshoe Crab Research  Virginia Tech  VA   125 000 for the Polish American Cultural Center in Philadelphia  PA   400 000 for the National Iron Workers Training Program   350 000 for leafy spurge control in North Dakota   1 725 million for the Hudson Valley Welcome Center in Hyde Park  NY   This omnibus was made available just yesterday  yet approved by the House last night  Imagine that  Mr  President   a 1 445 page bill  with a joint explanatory statement that is nine inches tall and costs  475 billion was made available and voted on by both chambers in less than 48 hours  Simply remarkable  It is impossible for us to know exactly what is in this thing  and were expected to simply take the appropriators word that its all okay  Well  Mr  President  Ive been around here long enough to know that a bill of this size  put together behind closed doors and rammed through at the last minute  cannot be all good  And I know it will be a long time before all of the hidden provisions in this legislation are exposed    I fully recognize that it isnt necessarily the fault of the appropriators that we are forced into this new pattern of adopting omnibus appropriations measures  Overly partisan politics has largely prevented us from following the regular legislative order  and that fact must change  But while it may not be the appropriators fault that we are forced to consider omnibus appropriations measures  it is their decision to continue to load them up with unauthorized earmarks   and at a rate that seems only increases year after year   When we ram through a gigantic bill  spending hundreds of billions of taxpayers dollars with little or no debate because we want to go home for Christmas  we send the message to the American people that we are not serious enough about our jobs  We essentially accomplish little almost all year long because everything requires 60 votes  and then  at the very last minute  we scramble around and throw together a mammoth bill like the one before us today  Were sending the signal that it is more important for us to be able to issue press releases  and Im sure hundreds of them will be going out today  about how much pork weve been able to get for our states and districts  than we are about good government and fiscal responsibility  How can we  in good conscience  defend this behavior to the American people    Among the most egregious aspects of this bill are the so called economic development initiatives funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development  This account is nothing more than a slush fund for the appropriators   plain and simple  Contained within this section of the joint explanatory statement are 741 locality specific earmarks costing nearly  180 million  These pork barrel projects are spread out over 42 pages and fund everything from construction of coastal trails  nature education centers  public parks and renovations for museums and theaters    On defense matters  the Omnibus Appropriations Bill proposes funding  1 18 billion in military construction projects that were not requested by the President  Of that amount   584 million was vetted by both the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to ensure that the Services critical unfunded priorities requirements were met  On the Senate floor  those projects were further reviewed  and approved in the Senate versions of the Authorization and Appropriations bills    However  this bloated Omnibus Appropriations Bill also includes another  580 millionfor 108 military airdropped construction projects  that is  funding for projects that were not included in any previous appropriations bill passed by the House or Senate  The House appropriators have once again waited until the last minute to present these new spending items to skirt responsibility for their pork spending  Mr  President  in the ethics reform law we passed with much fanfare earlier this year  we amended Senate Rule 44 specifically to discourage such airdropping of projects in the dead of night  In an unprecedented and unfortunate act  the Majority accepted  328 million of airdropped military construction authorizations into the recently passed National Defense Authorization Bill  It was in part for this reason that I reluctantly decided not to sign the defense authorization conference report  I could not then  and cannot now  support the parachuting of new spending items into final reports that have not been transparently vetted on the floor of Congress  I am very disappointed that we in the Senate continue to condone this irresponsible practice in light of our efforts to prevent it with ethics reform    The Omnibus Appropriations Bill also earmarks over  41 million for the planning and design of pork military construction projects requested by Members of Congress  Congress normally authorizes funding annually for each military service to plan and design their critical future military construction priorities  This bill disregards the military s priorities and earmarks funds towards specific projectswithout the Department being given the opportunity to determine whether or not those projects reflects actual military requirements   Even more egregious is that we are proposing to pay for this airdropped pork by cutting over  900 million from the amount of  8 1 billion requested by the President to carry out the critical military construction activities related to the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment round  Mr  President  the Department of Defense and the local communities affected by BRAC need enough funding to meet the statutory deadline of September 2011  To underfund BRAC in order to pay for earmarks is a sad reflection on the priorities of this Congress  which has again unabashedly put parochial interests above the needs of the Defense Department  our local communities and the American taxpayer   Mr  President  we simply must start making some very tough decisions around here if we are serious about improving our fiscal future  We need to be thinking about the future of America and the future generations who are going to be paying the tab for our continued spending  It is simply not fiscally responsible for us to continue to load up appropriations bills with wasteful and unnecessary spending  and good deals for special interests and their lobbyists  We have had ample opportunities to tighten our belts in this town in recent years  and we have taken a pass each and every time  We cant put off the inevitable any longer  Mr  President   In a report on our long term budget outlook issued this month  the Congressional Budget Office states this  Significant uncertainty surrounds long term fiscal projections  but under any plausible scenario  the federal budget is on an unsustainable path   that is  federal debt will grow much faster than the economy over the long run  In the absence of significant changes in policy  rising costs for health care and the aging of the U S  population will cause federal spending to grow rapidly    The report goes on to say that  If outlays increased as projected and revenues did not grow at a corresponding rate  deficits would climb and federal debt would grow significantly  Substantial budget deficits would reduce national saving  which would lead to an increase in borrowing from abroad and lower levels of domestic investment that in turn would constrain income growth in the United States  In the extreme  deficits could seriously harm the economy  Such economic damage could be averted by putting the nation on a sustainable fiscal course  which would require some combination of less spending and more revenues than the amounts now projected  Making such changes sooner rather than later would lessen the risk that an unsustainable fiscal path poses to the economy  Again   this is not my dire prediction   it comes from our own CBO   To underscore the urgency of the problem  in a speech at The National Press Club just yesterday  David Walker  the Comptroller General of the United States announced that   for the 11th straight year   the federal government failed its financial audit  Mr  Walker said that the federal governments total liabilities and unfunded commitments for future benefits payments promised under the current Social Security and Medicare programs are now estimated at  53 trillion  in current dollar terms  up from about  20 trillion in 2000  This translates into a defacto mortgage of about  455 000 for every American household and theres no house to back this mortgage  In other words  our government has made a whole lot of promises that  in the long run  it cannot possibly keep without huge tax increases   The Comptroller General also highlighted a specific program that serves as an example of the serious problems we face  He said  The prescription drug benefit alone represents about  8 trillion of Medicares  34 trillion gap  Incredibly  this number was not disclosed or discussed until after the Congress had voted on the bill and the President had signed it into law  Generations of Americans will be paying the price   with compound interest   for this new entitlement benefit  He went on to note that  Unfortunately  once federal programs or agencies are created  the tendency is to fund them in perpetuity  Washington rarely seems to question the wisdom of its existing commitments  Instead  it simply adds new programs and initiatives on top of the old ones  This continual layering is a key reason our government has grown so large  so expensive  so inefficient  and in some cases  so ineffective    Mr  Walker ended his speech by saying If all of us do our part  and if we start making tough choices sooner rather than later  we can keep America great  ensure that our future is better than the past  and ensure that our great nation is the first republic to stand the test of time  To me  that is a cause worth fighting for  I agree wholeheartedly  Mr  President  And I say to my colleagues   lets start making those tough choices today  We have to face the facts  and one fact is that we cant continue to spend taxpayers dollars on wasteful  unnecessary pork barrel projects or cater to wealthy corporate special interests any longer  The American people wont stand for it  and they shouldnt   they deserve better treatment from us
