                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM LEGISLATION March 30  2006  Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  spoke on the United States Senate floor and submitted for the record the following statement on the Border Security Bill  Mr  President  the Senate is beginning debate on a very important and complex subject that is among the most difficult and divisive we face  Our nation s immigration system is broken  And without comprehensive immigration reform  our nation s security will remain vulnerable  That is why we must act   I want to begin by commending Chairman Specter and the members of the Judiciary Committee for the considerable effort they have taken to report a comprehensive immigration reform measure that could be considered during this debate  While I may not be in agreement with each and every provision in their bill likely no one is  it offers a very good starting point for this debate   Those of us from border states witness every day the impact illegal immigration is having on our friends and neighbours  our county and city services  our economy and our environment  We deal with the degradation of our lands and the demands imposed on our hospitals and other public resources  Our current system doesnt protect us from people who want to harm us  It does not meet the needs of our economy  And it leaves too many people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse   Throughout this debate  we will be reminded that immigration is a national security issue  and it is  It is also a matter of life and death for many living along the border  We have hundreds of people flowing across our borders every day and an estimated 11 12 million people living in the shadows in every state in our country  While we believe that the majority are hard working people contributing to our economy and society  we can also assume there are some people who want to do us harm hiding among the millions who have come here only in search of better lives for themselves and their families  We need new policies that will allow us to concentrate our resources on finding those who have come here for purposes more dangerous than finding a job  Last year  when Senator Kennedy  Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  Martinez  Obama  Salazar and I worked together to develop a sensible bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform measure  first and foremost among our priorities was to ensure our bill included strong border security and enforcement provisions  We need to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security has the resources it needs to secure our borders to the greatest extent possible  These include man power  vehicles  and detention facilities for those apprehended  But we also need to take a 21st century approach to this 21st century problem  We need to create virtual barriers as well  through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  ground censors  cameras  vehicle barriers  advanced communications systems and the most up to date security technologies available to us  The Border Security provisions under the Leaders bill and the Judiciary Committees bill provide sound proposals to promote strong enforcement and should be part of any final bill  However  I do not believe the Senate should or will pass an enforcement only bill  Our experiences with our current immigration system have proven that outdated or unrealistic laws will never be fully enforceable  regardless of every conceivable border security improvement we make  Despite an increase of border patrol agents from 3 600 to 10 000  despite quintupling the Border Patrol budget  and despite the employment of new technologies and tactics all to enforce current immigration laws  illegal immigration drastically increased during the 1990s   While strengthening border security is an essential component of national security  it must also be accompanied by immigration reforms  We have seen time and again that as long as there are jobs available in this country for people who live in poverty and hopelessness in other countries  those people will risk their lives to cross our borders   no matter how formidable the barriers   and most will be successful   Our reforms need to reflect that reality  and help us separate economic immigrants from security risks  We need to establish a temporary worker program that permits workers from other countries   to the extent they are needed   to fill jobs that would otherwise go unfilled   Mr  President  we need workers in this country  There are certain jobs that Americans are simply not willing to do  For example  today in California and Arizona  fruit is rotting on the vine and lettuce is dying in the fields because farmers cant find workers to harvest their crops  At the same time  resorts in my own state of Arizona cannot open to capacity because there arent enough workers to clean the rooms  Restaurants are locking their doors because there is no one to serve the food or clear the dishes  We are facing a situation whereby the U S  population does not provide the workers that businesses desperately need  yet the demand for their services and products continues   The current immigration system does not adequately and lawfully address this problem  As long as this situation exists  without a legal path for essential workers to enter the country  we will have desperate people illegally crossing our borders and living in the shadows of our towns  cities and rural communities  That is not acceptable  particularly when we are fighting the war on terror  The vast majority of individuals attempting to cross our borders do not intend to harm our country  they are coming to meet our demand for labor and to earn money to feed their families  By the Border Patrols own estimates  99  of those apprehended coming across the border are doing so for work  However  the Border Patrol is overwhelmed by these individuals  They cannot possibly apprehend every crosser being smuggled in  no matter how many resources we provide  That is why any immigration legislation that passes Congress must establish a legal channel for workers to enter the United States after they have passed background checks and have secured employment  Then we can free up federal officials to focus on those individuals intending to do harm through drug smuggling  human trafficking and terrorism  In addition to a temporary worker program for future immigrants  we have to address the fact that 11 12 million people are living in the United States illegally  most of them employed  many whose children were born here  and are  therefore  American citizens  Our economy has come to depend on people whose existence in our country is furtive  whose whereabouts and activities  in many cases  are unknown  I have listened to and understand the concerns of those who simply advocate sealing our borders and rounding up and deporting undocumented workers currently in residence here  But that s easier said then done  Mr  President  Easier said than done  I have yet to hear a single proponent of this point of view offer one realistic proposal for locating  apprehending  and returning to their countries of origin over 11 million people  How do we do that  The columnist George Will quite accurately observed that it would take 200 000 buses extending along a 1700 mile long line to deport 11 million people  That s assuming we had the resources to locate and apprehend all 11 million  or even half that number  which we don t have and  we all know  won t ever have  And even if we could exponentially increase the money and manpower dedicated to finding and arresting undocumented workers in this country  and inventing some deportation scheme on a scale that exceeds all reality  we would  by removing these people from their jobs  damage the American economy   Instead  what we have allowed to be in effect is a de facto amnesty  where  for all practical purposes  a permanent underclass of people live within our borders illegally  fearfully  subserviently  vulnerable to abuse and exploitation  Most of these people aren t going anywhere  No matter how much we improve border security  No matter the penalties we impose on their employers  No matter how seriously they are threatened with punishment  We won t find most of them  We won t find most of their employers  There are jobs here that Americans aren t accepting  that people in other countries who have no future there will eagerly accept  They will find their way to those jobs  and employers who can t fill them any other way will employ them   And what of those we do apprehend  Do they have children who were born here  What shall we do with these Americans B and they are Americans by virtue of their birth here B when we deport their parents  Shall we build a lot of new orphanages  Find adoptive parents for them  Deny their citizenship and ship them back  too  No  Mr  President  we ll do none of these things  We ll simply continue our de facto amnesty program  Because we all know  we aren t going to find and deport so many millions and suffer the dislocation and agonizing moral dilemmas that such an impossible task would engender  So let s be honest about that  shall we   The opponents of our attempt to address undocumented workers in this country decry as amnesty our proposal to bring them out from their shadows and into compliance with our laws  No  Mr  President  it is not  Amnesty is  as I observed  for all practical purposes what exists today  We can pretend otherwise  but that doesnt make it so  Amnesty is simply declaring people who entered the country illegally citizens of the United States  and imposing no other requirements on them  That is not what we do  Mr  President   Under the provisions of our legislation  undocumented workers will have incentives to declare their existence and comply with our laws  They may apply for a worker visa  They would be subjected to background checks  They must pay a substantial fine  pay their back taxes  learn English  and enroll in civic education  remain employed here for six years  and then  at the end of those six years  go to the back of the line to apply for legal permanent resident  LPR  status  I believe most undocumented workers will accept these requirements in order to escape the fear  uncertainty and vulnerability to exploitation they currently endure  And while those who have come here to do us harm won t come out of hiding to accept these conditions  we will at least be spared the Herculean task of finding and sorting through millions of people who came here simply to earn a living   What are our opponent s alternatives  Raid and shutter businesses in every city and state in the country  Clog our courts with millions of immigration cases  Offer illegal immigrants the not too appealing opportunity to Areport to deport  We propose a better solution that is consistent with our country s tradition of being a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants   Mr  President  we are aware of the burdens illegal immigrants impose on our cities and counties and states  Those burdens  which are a federal responsibility  must be addressed  And we need also to face honestly the moral consequences of our current failed immigration system   As I mentioned previously  immigration reform is a matter of life and death for some  At this moment  someone may be dying in the Arizona desert  According to border patrol statistics  330 people died in fiscal year 2004  and that figure increased by 43  B to 472 deaths in 2005  As temperatures in the deserts get higher and the desperation more tangible  we can only expect the death tolls to increase further this fiscal year   In October of 2003  the Arizona Republic ran a story entitled A205 Migrants Die Hard  Lonely Deaths  I would like to read an excerpt from that story   Refer to article    In 2003  the bodies of 205 undocumented immigrants were found in Arizona  Official notations of their deaths are sketchy  contained in hundreds of pages of government reports   Beyond the official facts  there are sometimes little details  glimpses  of the people who died   Maria Hernandez Perez was No  93  She was almost 2  She had thick brown hair and eyes the color of chocolate   Kelia Velazquez Gonzalez  16  carried a Bible in her backpack  She was No  109   In some cases  stories of heroism or loyalty or love survive   Like the Border Patrol agent who performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a dead man  hoping for a miracle  Or the group of migrants who  with law officers and paramedics  helped carry their dead companion out of the desert  Or the husband who sat with his dead wife through the night   Other stories are almost entirely lost in the desolate stretches that separate the United States and Mexico   Within weeks  the heat makes mummies out of men  Animals carry off their bones and belongings  Many say their last words to an empty sky   John Doe  No  143  died with a rosary encircling his neck  His eyes were wide open   Closing  I am hopeful that at the end of this debate in the weeks ahead  we can show the American people that we addressed a serious and urgent problem with sound judgment  honesty  common sense and compassion  There are over 11 million people in this country illegally  They harvest our crops  tend our gardens  work in our restaurants  care for our children  clean our homes  They came as others before them came  to grasp the lowest rung of the American ladder of opportunity  to work the jobs others won t  and by virtue of their own industry and desire  to rise and build better lives for their families and a better America  That is our history  Mr  President  We are not a tribe  We are not an ethnic conclave  We are a nation of immigrants  and that distinction has been essential to our greatness   Yes  in this post 9 11 era  America must enforce its borders  There are people who wish to come here to do us harm  and we must vigilantly guard against them  spend whatever it takes  devote as much manpower to the task as necessary  But we must also find some way to separate those who have come here for the same reasons every immigrant has come here from those who are driven here by their hate for us and our ideals  We must concentrate our resources on the latter and persuade the former to come out from the shadows  We won t be able to persuade them if all we offer is a guarded escort back to the place of hopelessness and injustice that they had fled   Why not say to those undocumented workers who are working the jobs that the rest of us refuse  come out from the shadows  earn your citizenship in this country  You broke the law to come here  so you must go to the back of the line  pay a fine  stay employed  learn our language  pay your taxes  obey our laws  and earn the right to be an American  Riayen Tejada immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic  He came with two dreams  he said  to become an American citizen and to serve in the United States Marine Corps  He willingly accepted the obligations of American citizenship before he possessed all the rights of an American  Staff Sergeant Tejada  from Washington Heights by way of the Dominican Republic  the father of two young daughters  died in an ambush in Baghdad on May 14  2004  He had never fulfilled his first dream to become a naturalized American citizen  But he loved this country so much that he gave his life to defend her  Right now  at this very moment  there are fighting for us in Iraq and Afghanistan soldiers who are not yet American citizens but who have dreamed that dream  and have risked their lives to defend it  They should make us proud  not selfish to be Americans  They came to grasp the lowest rung of the ladder  and they intend to rise  Let them rise  Let them rise  Let us take care to protect our country from harm  but let us not mistake the strengths of our greatness for weaknesses  We are blessed  bountiful  beautiful America   the land of hope and opportunity   the land of the immigrant s dreams  Long may she remain so    end                                              March 2006 Press
