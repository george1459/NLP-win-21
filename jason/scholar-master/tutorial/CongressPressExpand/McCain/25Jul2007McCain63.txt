                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN ON S  1   THE HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 August 2  2007   Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record regarding the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007  Mr  President  over the past 20 years  I have often found myself in a somewhat lonely fight against earmarks and wasteful pork barrel spending  Year after year I have come to the floor and read list after list of the ridiculous items were spending money on   hoping enough embarrassment might spur some change  And year after year I would offer amendment after amendment to strip pork barrel projects from spending bills   usually only getting a handful of votes each time  Finally  I was encouraged in January when this body passed  by a vote of 96 2  an ethics and lobbying reform package which contained real  meaningful earmark reform  I thought that  at last  we would finally enact some effective reforms  Unfortunately  that victory was short lived   One of my happier days  Ill admit  was when Dr  Coburn was elected to the United States Senate in 2004  There is no better advocate of earmark reform  no one more consistent in standing firm to fight the worthy fight against wasteful spending  and I am proud to call him my friend  Id also like to commend Senators DeMint  Graham and others for joining our effort  Sadly  I say to my friends that given the very watered down earmark provisions contained in the measure brought to us by the Majority  our good fight clearly will have to continue  Not only does this bill do far too little to reign in wasteful spending   it has completely gutted the earmark reform provisions we passed overwhelmingly in January  It provides little more than lip service  unless of course you happen to be a Committee Chairman or the Majority Leader  Under this majority written bill  if you are lucky enough to hold one of those top positions  you will now yield even more power with your pork barrel pen    Mr  President  let me be clear  the ethics and lobbying reform bill before us today contains some good provisions which I strongly support  A ban on gifts and travel paid for by lobbyists or groups that employ lobbyists is long overdue  The increased disclosure requirements are also a welcome reform    But the bill before us fixes only part of the problem  Why were the earmark reform provisions contained in the bill we passed in January  again by a vote of 96 2  completely gutted from this version of the bill  To say that they needed to be changed in order for the House to agree just doesnt fly here   there was no excuse for changing those provisions   THEY APPLIED ONLY TO THE SENATE  Just six short months ago every one of my Democrat colleagues who voted supported a bill containing comprehensive earmark reforms   and now theyre gone  What changed  Why now do we have a bill before us with virtually none of the meaningful earmark reforms we overwhelmingly adopted such a short time ago   Ill tell you what happened  Mr  President   and it should come as no surprise to anyone  By earmarking scarce federal funds on teapot museums and bear DNA studies and bridges to nowhere  Congress has proven who they represent and who they are working for and its not the American taxpayer  In the eyes of the American people   we represent no one but the special interests  Whether it be catfish farmers in the south or blueberry farmers in the north or big Pharmaceutical companies with high paid lobbyists here in Washington   big monied special interests have a stranglehold on this town   thats why those earmark reform provisions are gone   and the American people know it  Just look at Congressional approval ratings  A recent CBS NYT survey showed Congress with an approval rating of just 26   Thats abysmal   and we deserve it    By ignoring the need for serious earmark reforms in this bill  we act like a doctor who is treating a patient with a broken arm  a broken leg and cancer  Were fixing the broken arm  and were fixing the broken leg  but the cancer remains and were doing nothing to treat it    Earmarks  Mr  President  are like a cancer  Left unchecked  they have grown out of control   increasing by nearly 400  since 1994  And just as cancer destroys tissue and vital organs  the corruption associated with the process of earmarking is destroying what is vital to our strength as a nation   that is the faith and trust of the American people in their elected representatives and in the institutions of their government    The corruption which stems from the practice of earmarking has resulted in current and former Members of both the House and Senate either under investigation  under indictment  or in prison  Lets be clear   it wasnt inadequate lobbyist disclosure requirements which led Duke Cunningham to violate his oath of office and take  2 5 million in bribes in exchange for doling out  70    80 million of the taxpayers funds to a defense contractor  It was his ability to freely earmark taxpayer funds without question    We cannot allow this to continue  We are squandering a golden opportunity to prove to the American public that we will end this wasteful practice once and for all  If we are really committed to addressing comprehensive ethics and lobbying reform in a meaningful and effective way  we must include meaningful earmark reform provisions in this legislative package  The process is clearly broken when each year Congress continues to earmark billions and billions of taxpayers dollars  sometimes with little or almost no knowledge about the specifics of those earmarks by most of the members of this body   Mr  President  my colleagues are all too familiar with my pork scrubs of the appropriations bills and my willingness to stand on this floor to inform the public of just how the Congress is spending their hard earned tax dollars  Yet despite my efforts  the growth in earmarked funding in appropriations bills during the past 12 years has been staggering   According to data gathered by CRS  there were 4 126 earmarks in 1994  In 2005  there were 15 877 again  an increase of nearly 400 percent  There was a little good news for 2006 solely because the Labor HHS appropriations bill was approved with almost no earmarks  an amazing feat given that there were over 3 000 earmarks in the previous years bill  Yet despite this first reduction in 12 years  it doesnt change the fact that the largest number of earmarks have still occurred in recent fiscal years    2004  2005  and 2006  Sadly  the best thing the 109th Congress did for the American taxpayers was fail to do our jobs and pass the annual appropriations measures  Instead  we ended up passing a clean Continuing Resolution in February to fund the government through the end of this fiscal year  essentially free of new earmarks  A remarkable  and likely one time  accomplishment   In regard to the level of wasted funding associated with those earmarks  it increased from  23 2 billion in 1994 to  64 billion in FY 2006  Remarkably  it rose by 34 percent from 2005 to 2006  even though the number of earmarks decreased  Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000  and more than tripled in the last 10 years  This is wrong and disgraceful and we urgently need to make some changes in the process around here  Unfortunately  the bill before us will do little to fix this broken process   Recently in the House of Representatives  when another member questioned the necessity of one of his earmarked projects  a Congressman raged at the idea of someone challenging what he described as my money  my money  Therein lies the problem  Mr  President  Too many Members of Congress view taxpayers funds as their own  And they feel free to spend it as they see fit  with no oversight and  often  no shame  Look at some of the things weve funded over the years     225 000 for an Historic Wagon Museum in Utah  1 million for a DNA study of bears in Montana  200 000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Ohio  220 000 for blueberry research at the University of Maine  3 million for an animal waste management research facility in Kentucky  170 000 for blackbird management in Kansas  196 000 for geese control in New York  50 000 for feral hog control in Missouri  90 000 for the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth  Texas  200 000 for an American White Pelican survey  6 million for sugarcane growers in Hawaii  13 million for a ewe lamb retention program  500 000 to study flight attendant fatigue  200 000 for a deer avoidance system in Pennsylvania and New York  3 million for the production of a documentary about Alaska    1 million for a waterless urinal initiative  500 000 for a Teapot museum in North Carolina  1 1 million to research the use of Alaskan salmon in baby food  25 million for a fish hatchery in Montana  16 million for display cases and interactive displays at the National Distance Running Hall of Fame in Utica  New York   37 million over four years to the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board to promote and develop fishery products and research pertaining to American fisheries  So how exactly does this Board spend the money Congress so generously earmarks every year  Well  they spent  500 000 of it to paint a giant salmon on the side of an Alaska Airlines 747   and nicknamed it the Salmon Forty Salmon    And we wonder why our approval rating stands at 26    Unfortunately  I could go on and on with examples of wasteful earmarks that have been approved by Congress  I really hoped that we had finally learned our lesson about the corruption that earmarking breeds with the convictions of Duke Cunningham and Bob Ney  But we havent  What will it take    Yes  some good has come from the Abramoff scandal  and the ethics and lobbying provisions in this bill are sound and overdue  But  in the end  they are meaningless if we dont put an end to a system that opened the door for the criminal activities of Duke Cunningham  Bob Ney  and whoever is next to fall  If we pass this bill without the earmark provisions we agreed to at the beginning of the year  then weve failed the American people   yet again  Time and time again leaders of both parties have stood up and promised to change the way things operate in Washington  particularly when it comes to how we spend taxpayers dollars  and time and time again we fail to change anything    So  lets talk about the earmark reforms contained in the Senate passed bill  again  which passed in January by a vote of 96 2  and compare them to what is included in the version we have before us today  First  let me be clear  The Senate passed provisions were modest  but they provided the most fundamental reforms I had witnessed in my time here  Under that bill  earmarks were not prohibited  which frankly  would be my ideal  But the Senate passed bill did ensure earmarks were fully disclosed and if they werent  the bill could not be considered  And the Senate passed version required that legislation be made available 48 hours before a vote and that any associated earmarks be in a searchable data base that the public could access  The Senate passed bill prohibited out of scope provisions and earmarks from being air dropped in conference  and allowed for Points of Order to be raised against specific items in conference reports that could be stricken from the conference reports without killing the entire measure  This is something I have advocated for years  and have introduced proposals to provide this ability since 2003  The Senate passed version also made it clear that if a provision was stricken from a conference report on a Point of Order  any associated money was also removed with it  After all  the goal behind earmark reform is to reign in wasteful spending    Now  lets compare all that to the new version presented to us this week  First  instead of preventing a bill from being considered if earmarks arent identified in the accompanying report  this version only applies to preventing a vote on a motion to proceed to a measure unless the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction or the Majority Leader  or his or her designee  certifies that all earmarks in the bill or accompanying report have been identified and publically available  Now  whats wrong with that  Well  nothing if you are the committee chair or the Majority Leader or the designee  But if you are a Senator wishing to exercise your rights under the Rules  this new rule basically gives you no rights  There is little consequence as to whether the so called certification is accurate or a farce  Instead of taking your case to the Senate Parliamentarian  whose only job now with respect to this provision will be to say whether or not a certification was provided  you will have to take it up with the Majority leaderor his designee  I wonder if the Majority Leader would name me or Dr  Coburn to be his designee  Doubtful    Let me read a quote from yesterdays Wall Street Journal  which says it even better   Our favorite switcheroo  Under the previous Senate reform  the Senate parliamentarian would have determined whether a bill complied with earmark disclosure rules  Under Mr  Reid s new version  the current Majority Leader  that is Mr  Reid himself  will decide if a bill is in compliance  When was the last time a Majority Party Leader declared one of his own bills out of order  So  while under this new version of the bill  earmarks should be disclosed in theory  the fact remains that only the Committee chair  the Majority Leader  or his designee can police it  If they say all of the earmarks are identified  we are to take it as gospel  Our only option is to appeal the ruling of the Chair that a certification was made    Conveniently  the bill was modified between its release Monday morning and another version Monday afternoon  Not surprising  it was a modification to the benefit of the business as usual crowd  It now would require a 60 vote threshold to appeal the ruling of the Chair compared to a mere majority vote under the version released a few hours earlier  Lets be clear   sixty Members are not going to overrule the Majority Leader  Business as usual  Mr  President  business as usual   The new version does retain the requirement that bills and conference reports be available 48 hours before a vote  but the searchable database is no longer a requirement when it comes to conference reports   the time when it would be of most value to Senators  staff and   most importantly   members of the public who want to review the final version of a measure to see exactly how their money is being spent    As I mentioned  the Senate passed version included provisions to allow Points of Order to be raised against out of scope items and earmarks added to conference reports  While the new version retains that requirement in part  it gutted the most important feature  which was to ensure that any related funding that was associated with the stricken item also be removed from the measure  As a result  the provision does nothing to promote fiscal responsibility  Sure  we might be successful at stripping a bridge earmark from a state  but the money will still be in the bill  And I can assure you it will be spent  Why the majority who wrote this bill thinks that is a responsible thing to allow is something they will have to explain   Mr  President  we  as Members  owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in a way that reinforces  rather than diminishes  the publics faith and confidence in Congress  An informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy  And  a democratic government operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye  By seriously addressing the corrupting influence of earmarks  this bill could go so much further in allowing Members to legislate with the imperative that our government must be free from corrupting influences  both real and perceived  We must act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the publics confidence in Congress does not become a collapse of confidence  We can  and we must  do more in this bill to end the practice of earmarking    Mr  President  in his farewell address  President Dwight D  Eisenhower reflected on the spending he believed to be excessive  His words then are all the more powerful in todays out of control environment    As we peer into society s future  he said  we   you and I  and our government   must avoid the impulse to live only for today  plundering  for our own ease and convenience  the precious resources of tomorrow  We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage  We want democracy to survive for all generations to come  not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow     And yet  if we cannot change  if we will not change  we risk precisely that  becoming the insolvent phantom of tomorrow  I wonder what President Eisenhower would think of this mess  But  then  perhaps others have contemplated the same question  After all  the Defense Appropriations bill we passed in December 2005 included a  1 7 million unauthorized  unrequested earmark for a memorial on the National Mall that would honor none other than       Dwight D  Eisenhower    I yield the floor
