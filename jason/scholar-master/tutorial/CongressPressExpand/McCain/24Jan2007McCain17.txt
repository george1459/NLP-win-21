                                                                                                                         MCCAIN DELIVERS TESTIMONY TO ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE HEARING ON GLOBAL WARMING January 30  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain today delivered the following testimony to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the subject of global warming   Madame Chairman  let me thank you for calling today s hearing to discuss the most important environmental issue of our time  climate change   Over the past several years  a number of my colleagues and I have spent considerable time studying the issue of climate change  We have traveled around the globe to see first hand the impacts of climate change and how it is changing the lives of people even as we speak  I am pleased to have visited Alaska  Antarctica  Australia  Canada  New Zealand  South America  Norway  and other parts of the Arctic region  Let me say  if anyone remains in doubt that climate change is real  I invite them to visit some of these places to see for themselves    The number of individuals in Washington who reject the clear evidence of global warming appears to be shrinking as its dramatic manifestations mount  A large number of prominent scientists  industry leaders  environmentalists  state and local government officials  the faith based community  and others agree that climate change is real and we must move quickly to address the problem in a meaningful and sustainable manner    We are no longer just talking about how climate change will effect our children s and grandchildren s lives  as we did just a few years ago  but we now are talking about how it is already impacting the world  Drought  declining snow packs  forest fires  melting ice caps  species dislocation and habitat loss  and extreme weather eventsBall are examples of how climate change is impacting us  We need to act to mitigate and adapt to these devastating events   More and more Americans are acknowledging that climate change is not only real  but that our action is critical  On Monday of last week  a coalition of major U S  based businesses  with a combined market capitalization of over  750 billion  joined with environmental organizations to call upon our federal government to quickly enact strong national legislation to achieve significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions  The members of the U S  Climate Action Partnership recognize that setting the ground rules now for managing greenhouse gasses will unleash American ingenuity in an all out effort to meet this complicated challenge    In their letter to President Bush  the coalition said that   properly constructed policy can be economically sustainable  environmentally responsible  and politically achievable  Swift legislative action on our proposal would encourage innovation and provide needed U S  leadership on this global challenge  They further stated that  climate change will create more economic opportunities than risks for the U S  economy  I agree   While action at the national level is essential  and it will eventually occur because the American public will demand it  I am pleased to also mention progress that is already being made at the state and local levels      Just six months ago  the state of California enacted legislation requiring mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  the first of its kind in the nation  That legislation would require that California s emissions be reduced to the year 1990 levels by the year 2020      The Northeast states of Connecticut  Delaware  Maine  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  and Vermont agreed in December 2005 to implement a  cap and trade  program to lower carbon dioxide emissions from power plants  This effort is continuing to grow as evidenced by the state of Massachusetts joining this regional effort two weeks ago     Also two weeks ago  an alliance of prominent U S  scientists and members of the faith community agreed to work together to push for a reduction in the Nation s greenhouse gas emissions  In their joint statement  the group said that Earth is  seriously imperiled by human behavior  and called on Americans to  steward the natural world in order to preserve  the planet  for ourselves and future generations      And  the U S  mayors have also agreed to take action  Over 375 U S  mayors  representing over 55 million people  have signed an agreement calling for emission reductions of 7 percent below the 1990 levels by the year 2012   Madam Chairman  we will continue to learn more about the science of climate change and the dangerous precedence of not addressing this environmental problem  The science tells us that urgent and significant action is needed    Later this week  we expect to receive from the United Nation s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a summary of their Fourth Assessment Report  Some well respected scientists are already calling it the  smoking gun  and the  iconic statement  on the issue of global warming    We recognize that many fear the costs of taking action  But there are costs to delay as well  Failure to implement significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions in the near term will yield only more climate change and a much harder job in the future  Simply stated  inaction is unsustainable   As Senator Lieberman and I have continued working for passage of legislation to address climate change in a meaningful way  and are continuing our efforts to further improve upon our legislation with the goal of producing the most innovative  meaningful  and economically feasible measure that can be embraced by the Senate  it has become clear to us that any responsible climate change measure must contain five essential components   First  it must have rational  mandatory emission reduction targets and timetables  It must be goal oriented  and have both environmental and economic integrity  Let us realize that the climate system reacts not to emission intensity but to atmospheric concentration levels  We need policy that will produce necessary reductions  not merely check political boxes  The reductions must be feasible and based on sound science  and this is what we have tried to do in our bill  We realized that this problem is an environmental problem with significant economic implications and not an economic problem with significant environmental implications    Second  it must utilize a market based  economy wide  cap and trade  system  It must limit greenhouse gas emissions and allow the trading of emission credits across the economy to drive enterprise  innovation and efficiency  This is the central component of our legislation  Voluntary efforts will not change the status quo  taxes are counterproductive  and markets are more dependable than regulators in effecting sustainable change    Third  it must include mechanisms to minimize costs and work effectively with other markets  The  trade  part of  cap and trade  is such a mechanism  but it s clear it must be bolstered by other assurances that costs will be minimized  I am as concerned as anyone about the economic impacts associated with any climate change legislation  I know that many economists are developing increasingly sophisticated ways to project future costs of compliance  Lately  we have seen the increased interest in this area of research  As we learn more from these models about additional action items to further reduce costs  we intend to incorporate them  Already  based upon earlier economic analysis  we have added  offsets  provisions in this bill in an effort to minimize costs and to provide for the creation of new markets  And  I assure my colleagues  we will continue to seek new and innovative ways to further minimize costs  Let me again mention what the coalition of CEO s of major US based companies and environmental groups said last week   In our view  the climate change challenge will create more economic opportunities than risks for the U S  economy    Fourth  it must spur the development and deployment of advanced technology  Nuclear  solar  and other alternative energy must be part of the equation and we need a dedicated national commitment to develop and bring to market the technologies of the future as a matter of good environmental and economic policy  There will be a growing global market for these technologies and the U S  will benefit greatly from being competitive and capturing its share of these markets  Our legislation includes a comprehensive technology title that would go a long way toward meeting this goal  Unlike the Energy bill  it would be funded using the proceeds from the auctioning of allowable emission credits  rather than from the use of taxpayers  funds or appropriations that will never materialize    And fifth  it must facilitate international efforts to solve the problem  Global warming is an international problem requiring an international effort  The United States has an obligation to lead  If we don t lead proactively  we will find ourselves following  There is no in between  However  our leadership cannot replace the need for action by countries such as India and China  We must spur and facilitate it  We have added provisions that would allow U S  companies to enter into partnerships in developing countries for the purpose of conducting projects to achieve certified emission reductions  which may be traded on the international market    These five components represent a serious challenge that will require a great deal of effort  the concentration of substantial intellectual power  and the continued efforts of our colleagues and those in the environmental  industrial  economic  and national security communities  I look forward to collaborating with the Committee in this effort as we continue to shape our legislation into its most effective form   Madame Chairman  I believe that Senator Lieberman has already provided the Committee with a thorough description of our bill  S  280  the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007  I won t seek to repeat it  However  I would like to address one issue that I know has been of concern for some on the Committee  and that is the topic of nuclear energy   I know that some here maintain strong objections to nuclear energy  even though today it supplies nearly 20 percent of the electricity generated in the U S  and much higher proportions in places such as France  Belgium  Sweden and Switzerland   countries that are not exactly known for their environmental disregard  The fact is  nuclear energy is CLEAN  It produces ZERO emissions in operations  It has the lowest carbon footprint  and is  therefore  undeniably a valuable tool for reigning in greenhouse gas emissions both quickly and economically   Nuclear energy is growing  and it will continue to grow substantially in the coming decades given the growing electricity needs around the world  Not only should we promote U S  companies in their efforts to compete for important roles in this growing market throughout the world  we should be helping them in promoting nuclear in a safe and efficient manner here in the United States  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC   which is under this Committee s jurisdiction  is already preparing for a substantial number of license applications for new plants  I am confident that this committee  under the Chairman s and Ranking Member s leadership  will work to ensure that safety remains first and foremost among the NRC s responsibilities  as it must    Finally  I  too recognize and share the concerns of what to do with nuclear waste  I am confident that given political will and time for technology development and deployment  we can solve that problem  It is important to recognize the responsible waste management that occurs in the nuclear industry today  Yet  while there is a great concern over comparatively small quantities of responsibly managed nuclear waste  there is an even more dangerous event occurring under our noses  And that is 900 tons of carbon dioxide per second being dumped in the atmosphere from fossil fuel use  Now that is a an urgent waste problem that should be concerning us most   Therefore  I hope we can have a thorough debate about the importance of nuclear energy and its future as we grapple with how best to address global warming  We need to better understand what is necessary to bring new  safe and reliable nuclear power plants on line  I hope that we can work together  Madame Chairman  to ensure we put all options on the table so that the Senate can pass the most innovative  effective  and economically feasible climate change legislation possible   The status quo is a strong and stubborn force  People and institutions are averse to change  even when that change is critical for their own well being  and that of their children and grandchildren  If the scientists are right and temperatures continue to rise  we could face environmental  economic  and national security consequences far beyond our ability to imagine  If they are wrong and the Earth finds a way to compensate for the unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  what will we have accomplished  Cleaner air  greater energy efficiency  a more diverse and secure energy mix  and U S  leadership in the technologies of the future  There is no doubt  failure to act is the far greater risk
