                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN REITERATES HIS COMMITMENT TO FIGHT AGAINST ONLINE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY September 19  2006  Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following statement at the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation hearing on online child pornography   This afternoon s hearing brings to the Committee s attention what some have called an epidemic of child pornography on the Internet  I say child pornography  but that label doesnt describe accurately what we are talking about today  As emphasized by a recent Department of Justice report  child pornography does not come even close to describing these images  What we are really talking about is recorded images of child sexual abuse  These images are  quite literally  digital evidence of violent sexual crimes perpetrated against the most vulnerable among us   Experts are also finding that the images of child sexual exploitation produced and distributed today    often online    involve younger and younger children  As Ernie Allen emphasizes in his prepared testimony on behalf of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children    known as NICK MEC    83 percent of offenders surveyed in a recent study were caught with images of children younger than 12 years old  Thirty nine percent had images of children younger than six  Almost 20 percent had images of children younger than 3  These are not normal criminals  and I cannot fathom the extent of the physical and emotional harm they cause their victims   The violence of the images continues to increase as well  As Dr  Cooper states in her prepared testimony  the images that she has reviewed in her Sheriff Brown s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force also has direct experience with these increasingly violent and disturbing images of child sexual exploitation   The graphic description of these images given by some of the witnesses in their prepared testimony is difficult to stomach and almost impossible to grasp as the actions of human beings    and I do advise everyone in this room that the matters discussed today are not appropriate for children  However  as policy makers  it is our duty to face these matters head on so that we can understand the extent of this evil and determine how best to fight it  Its also our duty to bring these issues to light so that parents around the country know exactly what dangers their children face   It s also important to stress that  though the focal point of this hearing is online child pornography  the actual exploitation occurs in the offline world  Children can be sexually abused by people who have access to them at school and  unfortunately  even in the children s own homes  I hope our witnesses will talk about how parents and communities can protect children from sexual exploitation in addition to discussing what law enforcement is doing to combat this crime   I note with some disappointment that we do not have Internet companies represented today  although they were invited to participate  They are certainly a crucial component of our effort to eradicate child pornography  and I trust that the Committee under the leadership of Chairman Stevens will pursue further hearings to assess the private sector s contribution  I thank the Chairman for the courtesy of the gavel this afternoon  and I turn now to my colleagues for any opening statements they may have                                                   September 2006 Press Releases           Browse by                                                                                                                                                              Current record
