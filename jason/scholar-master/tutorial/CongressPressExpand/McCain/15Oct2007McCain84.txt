                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON S  1745 H R  3093  THE COMMERCE  JUSTICE  SCIENCE FY 08 APPROPRIATIONS BILL October 16  2007 Washington  D C  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record onS  1745 H R  3093  the Commerce  Justice  and Science FY 08 Appropriations Bill    Mr  President  I am deeply disappointed that once again  the Senate is considering a bill that mortgages our childrens future for our own political gain  To date  the Senate has passed five spending bills  the majority of which exceeded the Presidents budget request  Today  the Senate will seek to add a sixth appropriations bill to that list   The Senate Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  2008  S  1745 H R  3093  provides  54 billion in total discretionary spending and exceeds the Presidents budget by  3 2 billion  This has prompted the White House to call the bill irresponsible and threaten a veto  If this bill passes in its current form  the Senate will have approved six spending bills that combined exceed the Presidents budget by  8 Billion  And  the Senate still has six more appropriations bills to consider this year    While the recently enacted ethics and lobbying reform measure requires the disclosure of the authorship of earmarks  it seems to have had little  if any  impact on curtailing earmarks  Indeed  91 members secured earmarks in this appropriations bill alone  There are over 600 earmarks in this bill that total  486 million  For example  this bill contains    1 million for the National Fatherhood Initiative   500 000 for a Maritime Museum in Mobile  AL   15 million for a Massachusetts Groundfish Disaster   I was unaware there was such a disaster     215 000 for the Alaska Sea Otter and Steller Sea Lion Commission   360 000 for Hawaii Rain Gages    Over  9 million for Human Intelligence Management    500 000 for Girls  Inc  of New York  NY    And  if that wasnt enough  the bill also includes   450 000 for an advanced undersea vehicle   500 000 for horseshoe crab research   2 million for permanent displays for the Thunder Bay Exhibit   3 million for the Maryland Institute for Dextrous Robotics   400 000 for wireless cameras in Elizabeth  NJ   5 million for forensic lab equipment in West Virginia   1 5 million for the Cal Ripken Sr  Foundation    In addition  the bill provides funding to many programs that were proposed to be cut by the President  It also funds many other programs at levels beyond what was recommended by the Presidents budget  For example   100 million is allocated for the Advanced Technology Program that the President has sought to eliminate for the past several years and  110 million is allocated for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program     64 million above the Presidents budget request  The sole purpose of both programs is to subsidize private firms and industries  which  as Ive argued previously  are nothing more than welfare programs for corporate special interests  I have fought against funding for both of these programs for many years to no avail  but will continue to speak out against hard earned tax payer dollars being provided to assist corporations that have billions of capital available to them on the private markets    Since the bill has been brought to the floor  over  1 billion worth of spending has been added  Specifically  the Senate voted to add  1 billion on top of the  10 billion the bill already provided to NASA  I continue to support NASA and space research  but at what cost to our nations children who will inherit the largest national debt this country has seen   Mr  President  again  I would like to express my disappointment that Senate leadership has brought to the floor a bill that is  3 billion over the Presidents request containing more than 600 earmarks  In my recent travels around the nation  I hear again and again from citizens who are fed up with pork barrel spending and yet  Congress fails to listen  It is a shame and I can only hope that the American people will join me and the President in expressing their displeasure with this bill  I hope that the remaining six appropriations bills do not contain such rampant and reckless spending  and that Congress works to regain some fiscal discipline                                            October 2007 Press Releases           Browse by                                                                                                                              Current record
