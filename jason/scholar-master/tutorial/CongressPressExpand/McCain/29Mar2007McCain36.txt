                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON STEM CELL RESEARCH April 11  2007  Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement on the Senate floor regarding Stem Cell Research legislation    Mr  McCAIN     Mr  President  I will vote in support of the two bills under consideration today  S  5 and S  30  which would provide a framework for federal support of stem cell research under strict guidelines and ethical criteria  I supported similar legislative proposals during the last Congress      Mr  President  stem cell research has the potential to give us a better understanding of deadly diseases and spinal cord injuries affecting millions of Americans  One day  these efforts may lead to cures and treatments for these devastating diseases and conditions  At the same time  it is important and right to recognize the ethical and moral concerns have been raised by individuals inside and outside of the medical research community regarding one particular type of stem cell research that involves embryonic stem cells  I believe that these two bills will provide an appropriate framework for moving stem cell research forward in a responsible way      We must create a framework for federal support of stem cell research now  since research involving embryonic stem cells is also proceeding outside the United States  While we have had a robust and needed debate on the ethical and moral concerns of embryonic stem cell research  as reflected by the President   s Commission on Bioethics  the same cannot always be said of private industry and scientific research communities in other parts of the world  I am deeply concerned where unregulated research may lead us if researchers are left without ethical and moral guidance and stringent regulations and oversight      It does not have to be that way  One bill before us today  S  5  is similar to H R  810  a bill that I supported and that passed the Senate on July 18  2006  S  5 will provide the same strict ethical guidelines for stem cell research that the Senate supported last year  This bill would authorize federal support for embryonic stem cell research  but limits appropriately that support to scientists who use embryos originally created for reproductive purposes  and now frozen or slated for destruction by in vitro fertilization clinics  Before there is even consideration of whether to donate unused embryos for research  the legislation would require that the patient who is the source of the embryos be consulted and a determination be made that these embryos would otherwise be discarded  and would never have been implanted in the patient or another woman       S  5 also provides support for alternative stem cell research methods by offering increased federal funding and support for research that does not involve the use of human embryos  Such alternative research was unanimously supported in the Senate last July and deserves our full support again today  Researchers believe that this type of stem cell research hold tremendous potential and I strongly support their efforts  Millions of Americans affected by many diseases and conditions stand to benefit from the future cures provided by this type of research      I am also supportive of the other measure that is before us today  S  30  This bill will also offer increased federal funding and support for adult stem cell research and other research that does not involve the use of human embryos  Additionally  S  30 would allow research to be performed on embryonic stem cells taken from naturally dead embryos  This research shows some promise but only additional research will tell whether it can lead to cures and treatments  and we should embrace the opportunity that would be afforded under this legislation to determine the research potential that might exists      Mr  President  the United States offers an ideal climate for scientific and medical research because of the quality of our educational institutions  the strength of our economy  and the scope of our comprehensive legal and regulatory system for protection of intellectual property rights  The guidelines and requirements contained in S  5 do not exist currently  and this sort of embryonic stem cell research remains largely unregulated in the private sector and in many scientific communities overseas  Enacting S  5 would provide the federal oversight necessary to ensure that embryonic stem cell research does not expand into ethically objectionable ground in balancing the promise on the foreseeable horizon of stem cell research with the protection of human life       It should be clearly recognized that embryonic stem cell research will occur with or without federal approval and guidance  Keeping that in mind  I believe embryonic stem cell research is best carried out under strict federal guidelines and oversight  With the limited federal support and stringent guidelines afforded under this legislation  we can promote the benefits of stem cell research while maintaining clearly our ethical and moral values and obligations  which we must never sacrifice at any price                                                April 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
