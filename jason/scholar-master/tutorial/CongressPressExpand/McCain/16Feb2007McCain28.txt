                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN STATEMENT ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SAVE LIVES ACT OF 2007 March 1  2007 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding the introduction of the SAVE LIVES Act of 2007    Mr  McCain     Mr  President  I am pleased to introduce today the Spectrum Availability for Emergency Response and Law Enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency Services Act  otherwise known as the SAVE LIVES Act  The bill would provide public safety with the ability to use an additional 30 MHz of radio spectrum for a new nationwide public safety state of the art broadband network  This would allow police  fire  sheriffs  and other medical and emergency professionals the ability to communicate using a modern and reliable broadband network  thereby allowing for interoperable communications between local  state and Federal first responders during emergencies       The 9 11 Commission   s Final Report states that     Command and control decisions were affected by the lack of knowledge of what was happening 30  60  90  and 100 floors above    due to the inability of police and firefighters to communicate using their hand held radios  The Final Report recommended the    expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum to public safety entities    to resolve the problem  This bill would finally implement fully the recommendation       Let me be clear  the federal government has made many strides in developing a comprehensive  interoperable emergency communications plan  setting equipment standards  funding the purchase of interoperable communications equipment  and belatedly making additional radio spectrum available  But none of this is enough  We will not solve our nation   s interoperability crisis until all emergency personnel involved in responding to an incident are able to communication seamlessly  and that is what this legislation is intended to accomplish       I have been working on this issue for many years  Ten years ago  while serving as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee  I introduced the Law Enforcement and Public Safety Telecommunications Empowerment Act  which would have provided public safety with 24 MHz in the 700 MHz bandAlthough my bill did not pass  Congress did require this spectrum to be allocated to public safety in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997       Unfortunately  this spectrum was encumbered by television broadcasters who refused to move despite broadcasters being given other spectrum in the Telecommunications Act of 1996  The television broadcasters persuaded some members of Congress to slip into the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 a provision that allowed for broadcasters to retain their new spectrum and use the spectrum dedicated to public safety for an indefinite time       Rightly  public safety fought the broadcasters    spectrum squatting    and asked Congress to set a firm date for broadcasters to provide public safety spectrum  I was happy to support them in the fight       During the 108th Congress  I introduced a bill that would have provided public safety with this spectrum by January 1  2008  The bill was not considered by the Senate  I also introduced an amendment to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to set a firm date for the delivery of this spectrum  but it was strongly opposed thank to the broadcasters       In October 2005  the Commerce Committee debated a firm date as part of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2006  I offered an amendment to make the spectrum available by January 2007  but it was shot down by a vote of 17 5  I then took an amendment to the floor which was defeated by a vote of 30 69  Congress did finally set the date of February 17  2009    date that is too late in my opinion       I have not only been concerned about public safety not receiving spectrum in a timely manner  but also not receiving enough spectrum  In 2004  I offered an amendment that was included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  which required the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to study the short term and long term spectrum needs of public safety  In December 2005  the FCC delivered their report  While the report did not contain a specific amount of spectrum necessary to aid public safety interoperability  it did state          emergency response providers would benefit from the development of an integrated  interoperable nationwide network capable of delivering broadband services throughout the country     DHS has never provided its report to Congress      The FCC   s recommendation became all too apparent during the horrors of Hurricane Katrina  First responders in Louisiana were unable to communicate with each other during their response and recovery efforts because New Orleans and the three nearby parishes all used different radio equipment and frequencies  To make matters worse  Federal officials responding to the area used an entirely different communications system than the local first responders  which hindered relief efforts  New Orleans officials had purchased equipment that would allow some patching between local and Federal radio systems  but that the equipment was rendered useless by flooding  Nonetheless  short term solutions to link incompatible systems are not the right approach to this critical problem  A better approach is for this nation and its representatives to get serious about public safety communications by developing an interoperable communications network for all local  state  regional and Federal first responders that can carry voice and data communications       Mr  President  I believe the SAVE LIVES bill provides that comprehensive and serious approach  The bill would establish a national policy for public safety spectrum directing that the 24 MHz allocated by Congress to public safety in 1997 be used for state  local and regional interoperability and that the 30 MHz in the 700 MHz band be available as needed for a national  interoperable public safety broadband network by local  state  regional and Federal first responders  These two networks would be interoperable  thereby allowing local  state  regional and Federal first responders to communicate  Congress has deemed spectrum in the 700 MHz band    ideal    for public safety communications because it can travel great distances and penetrate thick walls       The day before our nation experienced the worst act of terrorism on our soil  the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee completed an 850 page study of public safety spectrum requirements and recommended that 97 5 MHz of additional spectrum be made available for public safety  In 1997  Congress set aside 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use  but due to television broadcasters refusal to relocate from that spectrum  public safety will not have full use of the spectrum until February 2009  However  public safety states that the 24 MHz is not enough  Just last month  Fire Chief Charles Werner of Virginia testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that an additional 70 MHz may be needed by 2011       The bill also would establish a    Public Safety Interoperable Working Group     the Working Group  to establish user driven specifications for public safety   s use of the 30 MHz and then require the FCC to auction the 30 MHz under a    conditional license    that requires any winning bidder to meet public safety   s specifications to operate a national  interoperable public safety broadband network  If there is no winning bidder  then the license to the 30 MHz will revert to public safety  which could then use the spectrum for a national  interoperable public safety broadband network and work with the FCC to auction excess non emergency capacity      To ensure public safety is using the spectrum effectively and efficiently  the bill would require the FCC to review public safety   s use of the 24 MHz to determine whether it could handle a national interoperable broadband network in addition to local  state and regional networks as technology improves  The bill would also require the FCC  DHS and public safety to review the possibility of moving most public safety communications to the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands thereby enhancing interoperability       As required by Congress  the FCC is slated to auction spectrum in the 700 MHz band by January 28  2008  Except for the 24 MHz allocated to public safety  the remaining spectrum will be auctioned to commercial providers unless Congress dictates otherwise  Therefore any use of the 30 MHz by public safety must be considered quickly by Congress as the FCC would need to begin developing the rules for a conditional license by early fall to ensure that the auction date is not delayed       Late last year  the FCC stated     The availability of a nationwide  interoperable  broadband communication network for public safety substantially could enhance the ability of public safety entities to respond to emergency situations     yet only 2 6 MHz is designated for nationwide interoperable communications in the 700 MHz public safety band     This is unacceptable and that is why I believe the SAVE LIVES Act would solve the interoperability crisis that faces our country       We cannot survive another disaster such as 9 11 or Katrina without reforming our nation   s interoperable communications  I fought for many years to clear the 700 MHz spectrum for first responders and now that there is a firm date for the availability of this spectrum  we should ensure that a sufficient amount of spectrum is being provided to first responders  Again  this spectrum is slated to be auctioned in January 2008 to commercial entities  so if Congress does not act now to ensure that public safety can have some reasonable access to this valuable spectrum  it will be auctioned off without any consideration to our nation   s interoperability crisis and this opportunity will be lost forever       Mr  President  I know some critics would rather all of this spectrum be auctioned solely for commercial applications  such as wireless Internet surfing  instant messaging and phone services  I can assure you  Mr  President  I do not lay awake at night wondering why my children can   t surf the Internet on their cell phone from any location at any time  but I do worry about whether we will be adequately prepared to respond to the next disaster       I can only imagine how many lives could have been saved during 9 11 had this spectrum been available and I can only imagine how many victims of Hurricane Katrina could have been rescued sooner if only police  fire fighters and other emergency personnel had been able to communicate with each other  But instead of imagining  we have an obligation to act Mr  President  We can have a national  interoperable communications system available to first responders by 2009 if we act now to make this spectrum available to public safety       I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the SAVE LIVES Act                                                       March 2007 Press Releases
