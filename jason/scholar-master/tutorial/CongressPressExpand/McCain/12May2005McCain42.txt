 2005 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  announced that on May 13th  the Senate Armed Services Committee completed its markup of the National Defense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 2006  FY06   This legislation authorizes  441 6 billion for national defense programs  which is  21 billion more than in 2005  and an additional  50 billion to pay for continued operation in Iraq and Afghanistan  The defense authorization bill authorizes appropriations to purchase and modernize weapons systems and fund research and development for new weapons systems  In addition  the bill authorizes funding for operations and maintenance for the services  pay and quality of life improvements for service members  and military construction projects at military bases   The Senate s version of the FY06 defense bill authorizes funding for a wide range of defense industries  ranging from small subcontractors to some of the nation s leading prime contractors located in Arizona   Although Arizona s economy is not critically dependent on defense jobs  the impact on defense spending on Arizona s prosperity is obviously significant and is particularly important in creating the kind of high technology jobs and facilities that are essential to economic growth in the state   McCain said  Arizona defense industries received approximately  7 billion in defense contracts   Some

000 jobs and add  5 7 billion in direct economic impact to the state  Additionally  military retirees living in the state spend about  200 million a year in Arizona  Many of these retirees reside in Arizona because they have access to base facilities and medical care  The Senate Armed Service s Committees action authorizes nearly  100 million for Arizona bases for major construction projects  These construction projects will improve critical base infrastructure and quality of life for service members and their families  Some of the key military construction projects for Arizona s bases and installations are     An upgrade to the Wastewater Treatment Plant and building of 35 new family homes at Yuma Proving Grounds     Additional facilities and space to the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station to increase the ability to fuel helicopters more efficiently and safely     The construction of a new 144 room enlisted barracks complex on Luke Air Force Base in the Phoenix West Valley     A new Combat  and Rescue  CSAR  headquarters complex on Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson     The construction of 131new family homes at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista    Realigns the Papago Park Military Reservation to more adequately reflect the mission and usage by the Arizona National Guard   Our military has demonstrated tremendous success and perseverance during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and deserves our full measure of funding and support   The Senate Armed Services Committee s markup of the National Defense Authorization bill for FY06 demonstrates Congress  continued support for our troops in the Global War on Terrorism   McCain said   This bill goes far in taking care of service members by paying them adequately  equipping them with top notch equipment  and providing for their health  morale and welfare  as well as for that of their families   McCain said    end                                             May 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
