                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT July 10  2007 WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered a statement on the Senate floor about the Defense Authorization Act of 2008  The remarks as prepared for delivery are below       Mr  President  the Senate has reached another moment of great importance  In debating the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill  we will help set the course of our nation   s security policy and influence our participation in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  Much of the debate will be about Iraq  and I will have more to say about that important matter in a few moments  Before I do  I would like to note the many provisions in this bill that constitute good defense policy and that will strengthen the ability of our country to defend itself  That is why the Committee voted unanimously to report the bill  It fully funds the President   s  648 billion defense budget request  it provides necessary measures to avoid waste  fraud and abuse in defense procurement  and it makes Members accountable for their spending      I would like to thank Chairman Levin  the subcommittee chairs  and all the Committee members for their work in bringing this measure to the floor  We have a good bill  We   ve authorized a 3 5 percent across the board pay raise for all military personnel and we   ve increased Army and Marine end strength to 525 400 and 189 000  respectively  I hope that by boosting these numbers we can build a more flexible active duty force and deploy reservists more prudently       The Committee also approved  2 7 billion for items on the Army Chief of Staff   s Unfunded Requirements List  including  775 million for reactive armor and other Stryker requirements   207 million for aviation survivability equipment   102 million for combat training centers  and funding for explosive ordnance disposal equipment  night vision devices and machine guns  The bill also authorizes  4 1 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected  MRAP  vehicles for all of the Services    known requirements       The Committee has come up with the money to support our troops  and I have no doubt that the full Senate will follow step  Money and policy statements  however  are not all that is required at this moment in our nation   s history  Courage is required  Mr  President  Not the great courage exhibited by the brave men and women fighting today in Iraq and Afghanistan  but a smaller measure  the courage necessary to put our country   s interests before every personal or political consideration       In this light I would like to discuss America   s involvement in Iraq  The final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus    new counter insurgency strategy arrived several weeks ago  and last week I had the opportunity to visit these troops in theatre  From what I saw and heard while there  I believe that our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  is making progress in a number of areas  I   d like to outline some of their efforts  not to argue that these areas have suddenly become safe     they have not     but to illustrate the progress that our military has achieved under General Petraeus   s new strategy       The most dramatic advances have been made in Anbar Province  a region that last year was widely believed to be lost to al Qaeda  After an offensive by U S  and Iraqi troops cleaned al Qaeda fighters out of Ramadi and other areas of western Anbar  the province   s tribal sheikhs broke formally with the terrorists and joined the coalition side  Ramadi  which just months ago stood as Iraq   s most dangerous city  is now one of its safest  In February  attacks in Ramadi averaged between 30 and 35  now many days see no attacks at all     no gunfire  no IEDs  and no suicide bombings  In Falluja  Iraqi police have established numerous stations and have divided the city into gated districts  leading to a decline in violence  Local intelligence tips have proliferated in the province  thousands of men are signing up for the police and army  and the locals are taking the fight to al Qaeda  U S  commanders in Anbar attest that all 18 major tribes in the province are now on board with the security plan  and they expect that a year from now the Iraqi army and police could have total control of security in Ramadi  At that point  they project  we could safely draw down American forces in the area       The Anbar model is one that our military is attempting to replicate in other parts of Iraq  with some real successes  A brigade of the 10th Mountain Division is operating in the areas south of Baghdad  the belts around the capital which have been havens for al Qaeda and other insurgents  All soldiers in the brigade are    living forward     and commanders report that the local sheikhs are increasingly siding with the coalition against al Qaeda  the main enemy in that area of operations  Southeast of Baghdad  the military is targeting al Qaeda in safe havens they maintain along the Tigris River  These and other efforts are part of Operation Phantom Thunder  a military operation intended to stop insurgents present in the Baghdad belts from originating attacks in the capital itself       In Baghdad  the military  in cooperation with Iraqi security forces  continues to establish joint security stations and deploy throughout the city in order to get violence under control  These efforts have produced positive results  sectarian violence has fallen since January  the total number of car bombings and suicide attacks declined in May and June  and the number of locals coming forward with intelligence tips has risen  Make no mistake     violence in Baghdad remains at unacceptably high levels  suicide bombers and other threats pose formidable challenges  and other difficulties abound  Nevertheless  there appears to be overall movement in the right direction       North of Baghdad  Iraqi and American troops have surged into Diyala Province and are fighting to deny al Qaeda sanctuary in the city of Baqubah  For the first time since the war began  Americans showed up in force and did not quickly withdraw from the area  In response  locals have formed a new alliance with the coalition to counter al Qaeda  Diyala  which was the center of Abu Musab al Zarqawi   s proposed    Islamic caliphate     finally has a chance to turn aside the forces of extremism      I offer these observations  Mr  President  not in order to present a rosy scenario of the challenges we continue to face in Iraq  As last weekend   s horrific bombing in Salahuddin Province illustrates so graphically  the threats to Iraqi stability have not gone away  Nor are they likely to go away in the near future  and our brave men and women in Iraq will continue to face great challenges  What I do believe  however  is that  while the mission     to bring a degree of security to Iraq  and to Baghdad and its environs in particular  in order to establish the necessary precondition for political and economic progress     while that mission is still in its early stages  the progress our military has made should encourage all of us       It is also clear that the overall strategy that General Petraeus has put into place     a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protecting the population  and which gets our troops off of the bases and into the areas they are trying to protect     that this strategy is the correct one  Some of my colleagues argue that we should return troops to the forward operating bases and confine their activities to training and targeted counterterrorism operations  That is precisely what we did for three and a half years  Mr  President  and the situation in Iraq only got worse  I am frankly surprised that my colleagues would advocate a return to the failed Rumsfeld Casey strategy  No one can be certain whether this new strategy  which remains in the early stages  can bring about ever greater stability  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Senate seek to legislate an end to the strategy as it is just commencing     should we do that  Mr  President  then we will fail for certain       Now that the military effort in Iraq is showing some signs of progress  the space is opening for political progress  Yet rather than seizing the opportunity  the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not functioning as it must  We see little evidence of reconciliation and little progress toward meeting the benchmarks laid out by the President  The Iraqi government can function  the question is whether it will       To encourage political progress  I believe that we can find wisdom in several suggestions put forward recently by Henry Kissinger  An intensified negotiation among the Iraqi parties could limit violence  promote reconciliation  and put the political system on a more stable footing  At the same time  we should promote a dialogue between the Iraqi government and its Sunni Arab neighbors     specifically Egypt  Jordan  and Saudi Arabia     in order to build broader international acceptance for the Iraqi central government  in exchange for that government meeting specific obligations with respect to the protection and political participation of the Sunni minority  These countries should cease their efforts to hand pick new Iraqi leaders and instead contribute to stabilizing Iraq  an effort that would directly serve their national interests  Finally  we should begin a broader effort to establish a basis for aid and even peacekeeping efforts by the international community  keyed to political progress in Iraq       In taking such steps  we must recognize that no lasting political settlement can grow out of a U S  withdrawal  On the contrary  a withdrawal must grow out of a political solution  a solution made possible by the imposition of security by coalition and Iraqi forces  Secretary Kissinger is absolutely correct when he states that    precipitate withdrawal would produce a disaster     one that    would not end the war but shift it to other areas  like Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia     produce greater violence among Iraqi factions  and embolden radical Islamists around the world       Let us keep in the front of our minds the likely consequences of premature withdrawal from Iraq  Many of my colleagues would like to believe that  should any of the various amendments forcing a withdrawal become law  it would mark the end of this long effort  They are wrong  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous  and more arduous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement       No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality of Iraq to the war on terror  there can simply be no debate that our efforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against violent Islamic extremism  Already  the terrorists are emboldened  excited that America is talking not about winning in Iraq  but is rather debating when we should lose  Last week  Ayman al Zawahiri  al Qaeda   s deputy chief  said that the United States is merely delaying our    inevitable    defeat in Iraq  and that    the Mujahideen of Islam in Iraq of the caliphate and jihad are advancing with steady steps towards victory         If we leave Iraq prematurely  jihadists around the world will interpret the withdrawal as their great victory against our great power  Their movement thrives in an atmosphere of perceived victory  we saw this in the surge of men and money flowing to al Qaeda following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan  If they defeat the United States in Iraq  they will believe that anything is possible  that history is on their side  that they really can bring their terrible rule to lands the world over  Recall the plan laid out in a letter from Zawahiri to Abu Musab al Zarqawi  before his death  That plan is to take shape in four stages  establish a caliphate in Iraq  extend the    jihad wave    to the secular countries neighboring Iraq  clash with Israel     none of which shall commence until the completion of stage one  expel the Americans from Iraq  Mr  President  the terrorists are in this war to win it  The question is  Are we      Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority would turn Iraq into a failed state and a terrorist sanctuary  in the heart of the Middle East  We have seen a failed state emerge after U S  disengagement once before  and it cost us terribly  In pre 9 11 Afghanistan  terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with impunity  We know that today there are terrorists in Iraq who are planning attacks against Americans  We cannot make this fatal mistake twice       As my friend Brent Scowcroft has said recently   The costs of staying are visible  the costs of getting out are almost never discussed      If we get out before Iraq is stable  the entire Middle East region might start to resemble Iraq today  Getting out is not a solution     Natan Sharansky has recently written     A precipitous withdrawal of U S  forces could lead to a bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by comparison     Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability  we will invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons  training fighters  providing resources  and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq  Iran will comfortably step into the power vacuum left by a U S  withdrawal  and such an aggrandizement of fundamentalist power has great potential to spark greater Sunni Shia conflict across the region       Leaving prematurely would induce Iraq   s neighbors  including Saudi Arabia and Jordan  Egypt to Israel  Turkey and others  to feel their own security eroding  and may well induce them to act in ways that prompt wider instability  The potential for genocide  wider war  spiraling oil prices  and the perception of strategic American defeat is real  Mr  President  and no vote on this floor will change that  This fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq alone  It is greater than that and more important still  about whether America still has the political courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for defeat  with all of the terrible things that accompany it  We cannot walk away gracefully from defeat in this war       General Petraeus and his commanders believe that they have a strategy that can  over time  lead to success in Iraq  General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker will come to Washington in September to report on the status of their efforts  and those of the Iraqis  They ask just two things of us  the time necessary to see whether their efforts can succeed  and the political courage to support them in their work  I believe that we must give them both       I know that senators are tired of this war  tired of the mounting death toll  tired of the many mistakes we have made in this war and the great efforts it requires to reverse them  tired of the war   s politicization and the degree to which it has become embroiled in partisan struggles and election strategies  I understand this fatigue  and yet I maintain that we  as elected leaders with a duty to our people and the security of their nation  cannot let fatigue dictate our policies       The soldiers I met last week have no illusions about the sacrifices necessary to achieve their mission  On July 4th I had the great privilege to be present as 588 troops reenlisted in the military and another 161 were naturalized as U S  citizens  Those men and women  taking the oaths of enlistment and citizenship in the center of Saddam   s al Faw Palace  they understand the many hardships made in our name  They have completed tour after tour  away from their families  risking everything     everything     for the security of this country  They do so because they understand that  however great the costs of this war  the costs are immeasurably greater still if we abandon it prematurely  All they ask is that we support them in their noble mission       I wish we had planned to fight this war correctly the first time  but we can no more turn back the clock to 2003 than we can wish away the consequences of defeat by imposing some artificial deadline for withdrawal  Last week in Iraq  I met the bravest men and women our country has to offer  and not one of them told me that it was time to go  or that the cause is lost  They are frustrated with the Iraqi government   s lack of progress  They are buffeted by the winds of partisanship in Washington  talking today of surges and tomorrow of withdrawal  voting to confirm General Petraeus and then voting for a course that guarantees defeat  But in the end  they know that the war in Iraq is part of a larger struggle  a war of moderation and stability against the forces of violence and extremism  They recognize that if we simply pack up and leave  the war does not end  It merely gets harder                                                    July
