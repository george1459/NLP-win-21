AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS May 26  2005 Washington D C   Senator McCain delivered the following statement today on the floor of the Senate in support of John Bolton s confirmation as United States Ambassador to the United Nations   Mr  President  I rise to speak again in support of John Bolton s confirmation as United States Ambassador to the United Nations   When I spoke on this floor in April in favor of Mr  Bolton  I highlighted a number of his qualities  including that he is smart  experienced  hard working  and talented  and that he knows the UN  In view of these and other impressive qualifications  the Senate has confirmed him four times in the past   In his current job as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security  Mr  Bolton has compiled a record of accomplishment  For example  next week marks the second anniversary of the Proliferation Security Initiative  a multilateral effort to stop trafficking of weapons of mass destruction and their components  John Bolton spearheaded this program since its inception  and today more than 60 countries support it  This success alone should disprove the argument that Mr  Bolton is somehow an arch unilateralist  bent on subverting collective international action   But PSI is not his only multilateral success  Mr  Bolton also helped to construct the G 8 s Global Partnership to secure dangerous technologies and materials  He led the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Moscow  which dramatically reduced the size of deployed nuclear arsenals in the U S  and Russia  And in his previous post as Assistant Secretary for International Organizations  he led the successful drive to repeal the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism   Much has been made in recent weeks about Mr  Bolton s personal disposition in dealing with colleagues  Let s be frank  he is not a career diplomat  either by profession or temperament  but then  the role of ambassador to the UN has always required something special  A look back at some of the personalities who have held this job  from Adlai Stevenson to Daniel Patrick Moynihan  from Jeane Kirkpatrick to Richard Holbrooke  shows that directness and forcefulness are assets  not hindrances  to effectiveness at the UN   We all know that Mr  Bolton is perhaps not the world s most beloved manager  nor one to keep his temper entirely under wraps  But I ask my colleagues  is this unique to Mr  Bolton  If a temper and an unorthodox management style were disqualifiers from government service  I d bet that half of Washington would be out of a job   Mr  President  it is worth wondering not whether Mr  Bolton is a mild  genteel diplomat  we know he is not  but rather whether he is the representative we need at the United Nations  We need an ambassador who truly knows the UN  We need an ambassador who is willing to shake up an organization that requires serious reform  We need an ambassador who has the trust of the President and the Secretary of State  Mr  Bolton  it seems to me  has what it takes for the job   The United Nations is a vital organization  to the world and to U S  national interests  But it is not perfect by any means  and John Bolton knows this  There has been talk that the nomination of Mr  Bolton was an indication of the administration s disdain for multilateral diplomacy  I cannot believe that Mr  Bolton wishes to be dispatched for four years to an ineffective body unloved by the U S  I do believe that he wants to work actively to reform the United Nations  to make it stronger and better  Mr  Bolton  seeing clearly the UN s strengths and its weaknesses  will be well positioned to improve the organization and America s relationship with it   And let s not forget that it desperately needs improvement  It is hard to take entirely seriously an organization that has countries like Sudan on its Human Rights Commission  or whose General Assembly equates Zionism with racism  But at the moment a great opportunity presents itself  The panel named by the Secretary General  on which my friend Brent Scowcroft served  has recently issued its list of recommendations to transform the UN  and Kofi Annan has presented his own serious plan to implement these recommendations  But without hard work and pressure  nothing will happen    over the years the UN has proved itself to be remarkably resistant to change  I believe that John Bolton could provide the medicine the United Nations needs   It s clear that I am not the only one who believes this  The list of respected foreign policy experts who support Mr  Bolton s nomination is much too long to enumerate here  But let me cite just a few  Former Secretary of State James Baker has called Mr  Bolton  the right man for the job  and former Secretary Lawrence Eagleberger has written a recent op ed praising him  Henry Kissinger  Frank Carlucci  and George Shultz  among others  have urged Mr  Bolton s quick confirmation  and a string of former ambassadors have done the same   Mr  President  elections have consequences  and one consequence of President Bush s reelection is that he has the right to appoint officials of his choice  I stress this  because the President nominates not the Democrats  selection  nor mine or that of any other senator  but his own choice  When President Clinton was elected  I did not share the policy views of some of the officials he nominated  but I voted to confirm them  knowing that the President has a right to put into place the team that he believes will serve him best   Mr  President  the Foreign Relations Committee has spent weeks investigating Mr  Bolton s background  In his recent report on behalf of the committee majority  Senator Lugar determined that  the end result of all this is that Secretary Bolton emerged looking better than when it began   Chairman Lugar ultimately concluded that Mr  Bolton  is a highly qualified nominee   and I agree  Let s move forward expeditiously to confirm John Bolton as America s ambassador to the United Nations    end                                             May 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
