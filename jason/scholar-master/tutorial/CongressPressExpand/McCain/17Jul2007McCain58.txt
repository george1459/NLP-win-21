                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON THE LEVIN REED IRAQ AMENDMENT July 17  2007 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following statement on the Senate floor about the Levin Reed Iraq Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY    08      Mr  President  I oppose the amendment offered by the Chairman and the Senator from Rhode Island that would mandate a withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq      The debate that has taken place on this floor for some months now comes down to this  It is a simple choice  The sponsors of this amendment would have us legislate a withdrawal of U S  combat forces from Iraq within 120 days of enactment  leaving in place only forces authorized to carry out specific narrow missions  That is one choice  to force an end to the war in Iraq and to accept thereby all the terrible consequences that follow  The other is to defeat this amendment  to give General Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and support they have requested to carry out their mission  to allow them to safeguard vital American interests and an Iraqi population at risk of genocide      That is the choice  Mr  President  and though politics and popular opinion may be pushing us in one direction  to take the easy course  we as elected leaders have a greater responsibility  A measure of courage is required  Not the great courage exhibited by the brave men and women fighting today in Iraq and Afghanistan  but a smaller measure  the courage necessary to put our country   s interests before every personal or political consideration       I would like to spend a few moments reviewing the state of affairs in Iraq today  The final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus    new counter insurgency strategy arrived several weeks ago  From what I saw and heard on my recent trip  and from briefings and reports since then  I believe that our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  is making progress in a number of areas  The areas where they are operating have not suddenly become safe     they have not     but they do illustrate the progress that our military has achieved under General Petraeus   s new strategy       The most dramatic advances have been made in Anbar Province  a region that last year was widely believed to be lost to al Qaeda  After an offensive by U S  and Iraqi troops cleaned al Qaeda fighters out of Ramadi and other areas of western Anbar  the province   s tribal sheikhs broke formally with the terrorists and joined the coalition side  Ramadi  which just months ago stood as Iraq   s most dangerous city  is now one of its safest  In February  attacks in Ramadi averaged between 30 and 35  now many days see no attacks at all     no gunfire  no IEDs  and no suicide bombings  In Falluja  Iraqi police have established numerous stations and have divided the city into gated districts  leading to a decline in violence  Local intelligence tips have proliferated in the province  thousands of men are signing up for the police and army  and the locals are taking the fight to al Qaeda  U S  commanders in Anbar attest that all 18 major tribes in the province are now on board with the security plan  and they expect that a year from now the Iraqi army and police could have total control of security in Ramadi  At that point  they project  we could safely draw down American forces in the area       The Anbar model is one that our military is attempting to replicate in other parts of Iraq  with some real successes  A brigade of the 10th Mountain Division is operating in the areas south of Baghdad  the belts around the capital which have been havens for al Qaeda and other insurgents  All soldiers in the brigade are    living forward     and commanders report that the local sheikhs are increasingly siding with the coalition against al Qaeda  the main enemy in that area of operations  Southeast of Baghdad  the military is targeting al Qaeda in safe havens they maintain along the Tigris River  and Maj  Gen  Rick Lynch  commander of operations there  recently reported that attacks on civilians in his area of operations were down 20 percent since April and civilian deaths had declined 55 percent  These and other efforts are part of Operation Phantom Thunder  a military operation intended to stop insurgents present in the Baghdad belts from originating attacks in the capital itself       In Baghdad  the military  in cooperation with Iraqi security forces  continues to establish joint security stations and deploy throughout the city in order to get violence under control  These efforts have produced positive results  sectarian violence has fallen since January  the total number of car bombings and suicide attacks declined in May and June  and the number of locals coming forward with intelligence tips has risen  Make no mistake     violence in Baghdad remains at unacceptably high levels  suicide bombers and other threats pose formidable challenges  and other difficulties abound  Nevertheless  there appears to be overall movement in the right direction       North of Baghdad  Iraqi and American troops have surged into Diyala Province and are fighting to deny al Qaeda sanctuary in the city of Baqubah  For the first time since the war began  Americans showed up in force and did not quickly withdraw from the area  In response  locals have formed a new alliance with the coalition to counter al Qaeda  Diyala  which was the center of Abu Musab al Zarqawi   s proposed    Islamic caliphate     finally has a chance to turn aside the forces of extremism      I offer these observations  Mr  President  not in order to present a rosy scenario of the challenges we continue to face in Iraq  As last weekend   s horrific bombing in Salahuddin Province illustrates so graphically  the threats to Iraqi stability have not gone away  Nor are they likely to go away in the near future  and our brave men and women in Iraq will continue to face great challenges  What I do believe  however  is that  while the mission     to bring a degree of security to Iraq  and to Baghdad and its environs in particular  in order to establish the necessary precondition for political and economic progress     while that mission is still in its early stages  the progress our military has made should encourage all of us      It is also clear that the overall strategy that General Petraeus has put into place     a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protecting the population  and which gets our troops off of the bases and into the areas they are trying to protect     that this strategy is the correct one  Some of my colleagues argue that we should return troops to the forward operating bases and confine their activities to training and targeted counterterrorism operations  That is precisely what we did for three and a half years  Mr  President  and the situation in Iraq only got worse  I am frankly surprised that my colleagues would advocate a return to the failed Rumsfeld Casey strategy  No one can be certain whether this new strategy  which remains in the early stages  can bring about ever greater stability  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Senate seek to legislate an end to the strategy as it is just commencing     should we do that  Mr  President  then we will fail for certain      Now that the military effort in Iraq is showing some signs of progress  the space is opening for political progress  Yet rather than seizing the opportunity  the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not functioning as it must  We see little evidence of reconciliation and none of the 18 benchmarks has yet been met  Progress is not enough     we need to see results  and today the results are not there  The Iraqi government can function  the question is whether it will  If there is to be hope of a sustainable end to the violence that so plagues that country  Iraqi political leaders must seize this opportunity  It will not come around again       To encourage political progress  I believe that we can find wisdom in several suggestions put forward recently by Henry Kissinger  An intensified negotiation among the Iraqi parties could limit violence  promote reconciliation  and put the political system on a more stable footing  At the same time  we should promote a dialogue between the Iraqi government and its Sunni Arab neighbors     specifically Egypt  Jordan  and Saudi Arabia     in order to build broader international acceptance for the Iraqi central government  in exchange for that government meeting specific obligations with respect to the protection and political participation of the Sunni minority  These countries should cease their efforts to hand pick new Iraqi leaders and instead contribute to stabilizing Iraq  an effort that would directly serve their national interests  Finally  we should begin a broader effort to establish a basis for aid and even peacekeeping efforts by the international community  keyed to political progress in Iraq       In taking such steps  we must recognize that no lasting political settlement can grow out of a U S  withdrawal  On the contrary  a withdrawal must grow out of a political solution  a solution made possible by the imposition of security by coalition and Iraqi forces  Secretary Kissinger is absolutely correct when he states that    precipitate withdrawal would produce a disaster     one that    would not end the war but shift it to other areas  like Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia     produce greater violence among Iraqi factions  and embolden radical Islamists around the world        Let us keep in the front of our minds the likely consequences of premature withdrawal from Iraq  Many of my colleagues would like to believe that  should the withdrawal amendment we are currently debating become law  it would mark the end of this long effort  They are wrong  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous  and more arduous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement       No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality of Iraq to the war on terror  there can simply be no debate that our efforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against violent Islamic extremism  Already  the terrorists are emboldened  excited that America is talking not about winning in Iraq  but is rather debating when we should lose  Last week  Ayman al Zawahiri  al Qaeda   s deputy chief  said that the United States is merely delaying our    inevitable    defeat in Iraq  and that    the Mujahideen of Islam in Iraq of the caliphate and jihad are advancing with steady steps towards victory     He called on Muslims to travel to Iraq to fight Americans  and appealed for Muslims to support the Islamic State in Iraq  a group established by al Qaeda       General Petraeus has called al Qaeda    the principal short term threat to Iraq     What do the supporters of this amendment believe to be the consequences of our leaving the battlefield with al Qaeda in place  If we leave Iraq prematurely  jihadists around the world will interpret the withdrawal as their great victory against our great power  Their movement thrives in an atmosphere of perceived victory  we saw this in the surge of men and money flowing to al Qaeda following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan  If they defeat the United States in Iraq  they will believe that anything is possible  that history is on their side  that they really can bring their terrible rule to lands the world over  Recall the plan laid out in a letter from Zawahiri to Abu Musab al Zarqawi  before his death  That plan is to take shape in four stages  establish a caliphate in Iraq  extend the    jihad wave    to the secular countries neighboring Iraq  clash with Israel     none of which shall commence until the completion of stage one  expel the Americans from Iraq  Mr  President  the terrorists are in this war to win it  The question is  Are we      The supporters of this amendment respond that they do not by any means intend to cede the battlefield to al Qaeda  on the contrary  their legislation would allow U S  forces  presumably holed up in forward operating bases  to carry out targeted counterterrorism operations  But our own military commanders say that this approach will not succeed  and that moving in with search and destroy missions to kill and capture terrorists  only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy  is the failed strategy of the past three and a half years      Major General Rick Lynch  who is directing a major part of the Baghdad offensive  said over the weekend that an early American withdrawal would clear the way for    the enemy to come back    to areas now being cleared of insurgents     When we go out there     he said     the first question they ask is     Are you staying     And the second question is     How can we help        General Lynch added that  should U S  forces pull back before the job is complete  we risk    an environment where the enemy could come back and fill the void     On Monday  Lt  Gen  Odierno  the number two commander in Iraq  said     My assessment right now is  I need more time        I   m seeing some progress now here in Iraq  We have really just started what the Iraqis term    liberating    them from al Qaeda          Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority would turn Iraq into a failed state and a terrorist sanctuary  in the heart of the Middle East  We have seen a failed state emerge after U S  disengagement once before  and it cost us terribly  In pre 9 11 Afghanistan  terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with impunity  We know that today there are terrorists in Iraq who are planning attacks against Americans  We cannot make this fatal mistake twice       As my friend Brent Scowcroft has said recently   The costs of staying are visible  the costs of getting out are almost never discussed      If we get out before Iraq is stable  the entire Middle East region might start to resemble Iraq today  Getting out is not a solution     Natan Sharansky has recently written     A precipitous withdrawal of U S  forces could lead to a bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by comparison     Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability  we will invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons  training fighters  providing resources  and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq  Iran will comfortably step into the power vacuum left by a U S  withdrawal  and such an aggrandizement of fundamentalist power has great potential to spark greater Sunni Shia conflict across the region       Leaving prematurely would induce Iraq   s neighbors  including Saudi Arabia and Jordan  Egypt to Israel  Turkey and others  to feel their own security eroding  and may well induce them to act in ways that prompt wider instability  The potential for genocide  wider war  spiraling oil prices  and the perception of strategic American defeat is real  Mr  President  and no vote on this floor will change that       Do not take my word from it  Consult  perhaps  the Iraq Study Group report  which says      a  chaotic Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally     and that    Al Qaeda will portray any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for their cause in the region and in the world     The report goes on to say that    a premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions      The near term results would be a significant power vacuum  greater human suffering  regional destabilization  and a threat to the global economy  Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory          Or perhaps ask the Iraqis  Brig  Gen  Qassim Attam  the chief Iraqi spokesman for the Baghdad security plan  said on Sunday that the Iraqi military and police force need more time before they are capable of assuming control of the country   s security       Or maybe our intelligence agencies which  in the January National Intelligence Estimate concluded     If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this Estimate  we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq  intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government  and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation      the ISF would be unlikely to survive as a non sectarian national institution  neighboring countries      might intervene openly in the conflict  massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable  AQI would attempt to use parts of the country      to plan increased attacks in and outside Iraq  and spiraling violence and political disarray in Iraq  along with Kurdish moves to control Kirkuk and strengthen autonomy  could prompt Turkey to launch a military incursion         Those are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal  and I hope that the supporters of such a move will tell us what they believe to be the likely consequences of this course of action  Should their amendment become law  and U S  troops begin withdrawing  do they believe that Iraq will become more or less stable  That al Qaeda will find it easier to gather  plan  and carry out attacks from Iraqi soil  or that our withdrawal will somehow make this less likely  That the Iraqi people become more or less safe  That genocide becomes a more remote possibility or ever likelier       Mr  President  this fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq alone  It is greater than that and more important still  about whether America still has the political courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for defeat  with all of the terrible things that accompany it  We cannot walk away gracefully from defeat in this war        How we leave Iraq is very  very important  Mr  President  As the Iraq Study Group found      i f we leave and Iraq descends into chaos  the long range consequences could eventually require the United States to return     General Petraeus and his commanders believe that they have a strategy that can  over time  lead to success in Iraq  General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker will come to Washington in September to report on the status of their efforts  and those of the Iraqis  They request just two things of us  the time necessary to see whether their efforts can succeed  and the political courage to support them in their work  I believe that we must give them both       Mr  President  right now  as we continue our debate on the war in Iraq  American soldiers  Marines  sailors and airmen are fighting bravely and tenaciously in battles that are as dangerous  difficult and consequential as the great battles of our armed forces    storied past  Americans who fought in France   s hedgerow country  those who bled in the sands and jungles of Pacific islands  who braved the onslaught of the Chinese Army in the frozen terrain of Korea  and who fought a desperate battle to retake Hue from the enemy during the Tet Offensive and against numerically superior forces in an isolated Marine base at Khe San will recognize and honor the sacrifice of Americans who now fight with such valor  determination and skill to defend the security interests and the honor of our country in desperate battles in Iraq       The hour is indeed late in Iraq  How we have arrived at this critical and desperate moment has been well chronicled  and history   s judgment about the long catalogue of mistakes in the prosecution of this war will be stern and unforgiving  But history will revere the honor and the sacrifice of those Americans  who despite the mistakes and failures of both civilian and military leaders  shouldered a rifle and risked everything     everything     so that the country they love so well might not suffer the many dangerous consequences of defeat       We read in our leading newspapers about those veterans of the Iraq War who have organized to oppose its continuation  They have fought for America   s freedom  and they have every right to exercise their freedom to oppose their government   s policies  I wish  though  that the press would pay at least equal attention to the many more veterans who have fought  suffered and witnessed the ultimate sacrifice  the loss of their dearest friends  and yet are still committed to America   s success in Iraq  and to those who have served multiple tours in this terrible war  and yet re enlist because they remain steadfast in the belief that they can achieve the mission they have already risked so much to achieve  The American public  those who still support our effort in Iraq and those who desire a quick end to it  should be daily reminded that although our country is deeply divided about this war  most of the many thousands of Americans who have suffered its worst miseries are still resolved that it not end in an American defeat      Our new counterinsurgency strategy is succeeding where our previous tactics failed us  We are taking from the enemy and holding territory that was once given up for lost  Those who have falsely described General Petraeus   s efforts as    staying the course    are the real advocates of continuing on the course of failure  Many of those who decry the way we got into this war and the way we fought it are now advocating a way out of it that suffers from a more willful refusal to face facts than they accused the administration of exhibiting  Although we all seem to be united in recognizing the mistakes and failures of the past  the proponents of reducing our forces in Iraq  and keeping them on secure bases from which they could occasionally launch search and destroy missions are proposing to return to the very tactics that have brought us to the point of trying to salvage from the wreckage of those mistakes the last best hope for success       That is what General Petraeus  and the Americans he has the honor to command  are trying to do     to fight smarter and better  in a way that addresses and doesn   t strengthen the tactics of the enemy  and to give the Iraqis the security and opportunity to make the necessary political decisions to save their country from the abyss of genocide and a permanent and spreading war  So far  the Maliki government has not risen to that challenge  and it must do so  It is obvious that America is losing our resolve to continue sacrificing its sons and daughters  while the Iraqi government will not take the political risks to do what is plainly in the best interests of the Iraqi people  But we do not fight only for the interests of Iraqis  Mr  President  we fight for ours as well       We  too  Mr  President  we members of Congress  must face our responsibilities honestly and bravely  What is asked of us is so less onerous than what we have asked from our servicemen and women  but no less consequential  We need not risk our lives  nor our health  but only our political advantages so that General Petraeus has the time and resources he has asked for to follow up on his recent successes and help save Iraq and America from the catastrophe that would be an American defeat  That is not much to risk  Mr  President  compared to the sacrifices made by Americans fighting in Iraq or the terrible consequences of our defeat  For if we withdraw from Iraq  if we choose to lose there  there is no doubt in my mind  no doubt at all  that we will be back     in Iraq and elsewhere    in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure       Little is asked of us to help prevent this catastrophe  but so much depends on our willingness to do so  on the sincerity of our pledge to serve America   s interests before our own  The Americans who must make the greatest sacrifices have earned the right to insist that we do our duty  as best as we can see it  and accept willingly and graciously whatever small sacrifice we must make with our own personal and partisan ambitions  Ours is a noisy  restive  and contentious profession  It has always been thus  Mr  President  and it always will be  But in this moment of serious peril for America  we must all of us remember to who and what we owe our first allegiance     to the security of the American people and to the ideals upon which we our nation was founded  That responsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged by history to have discharged it honorably will  in the end  matter so much more to all of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim  electoral advantage or office  The history of this country  after all  is not merely a chronicle of political winners and losers  it is a judgment of who has and who has not contributed to the continued success of America  the greatest political experiment in human history      It is my sincere wish that all of us  Republicans and Democrats  should know in our hearts whatever mistakes we have made in our lives  personally or politically  whatever acclaim we have achieved or disappointment we have suffered  that we have  in the end  earned history   s favor  I hope we might all have good reason to expect a kinder judgment of our flaws and follies because when it mattered most we chose to put the interests of this great and good nation before our own  and helped  in our own small way  preserve for all humanity the magnificent and inspiring example of an assured  successful and ever advancing America and the ideals that make us still the greatest nation on earth                                                July 2007 Press
