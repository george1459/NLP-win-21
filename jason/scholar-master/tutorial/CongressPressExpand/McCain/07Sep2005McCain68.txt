                                                                                                                         STATEMENT BY SENATOR JOHN McCAIN ON SENSE OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT REGARDING EARMARKS H R  2862  Departments of Commerce and Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill  2006 September 14  2005 Washington  D C   Senator McCain  R AZ  spoke on the floor of the United States Senate today  Follows are his remarks  Mr  President  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration   I thank the clerk for reading the amendment in its entirety for the benefit of my colleagues   As you have just heard  this Sense of the Senate amendment is fairly simple  It is an attempt to reign in wasteful spending  particularly during this time when portions of our country along the Gulf are enduring the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina  indeed a national tragedy   Mr  President  as our Nation continues to manage the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  it is imperative that Congress do what it can  what it must  to help the hundreds of thousands of victims of one of the worst natural disasters in our history  Congress must do all that is necessary to fund essential relief and recovery efforts and help those in need   The costs of the recovery and relief effort will be enormous  and it should go without saying that we live in times of great need and limited resources  In these times Americans are called to sacrifice  and Congress needs to make sacrifices of its own  To the extent that it is possible  we should pay for this effort now rather than pass on even more debt to future generations  We should also make better use of taxpayers money by eliminating our spending on matters of questionable merit or nonessential in order to better assist the victims of Katrina   These are times when members of Congress need to deny themselves a few of the comforts of political office and refrain from directing tax dollars to special projects in their States  These projects might help political campaigns but they do not necessarily benefit the country as a whole  Regrettably  as far back as I can recall  Congress has found a way to fund thousands of unauthorized projects of questionable merit  Perhaps some of those dollars would have been better spent on activities that might have limited the impact of this tragedy   Mr  President  this years Commerce and Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill  H R  2862  is relatively restrained compared to recent bills that have moved through the Senate  the highway bill comes to mind  Still  the legislation contains several examples of the types of provisions that magically appear in too many of the appropriations bills that benefit parochial interests with little regard to the merits at the expense of national priorities   For example  H R  2862 contains several earmarks that fund initiatives that some  including myself  might consider to be of less than pressing importance  Among them are a  10 million dollar earmark for the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board and a  1 75 million dollar earmark for something called the Hawaii Humpback Education Program   This bill also provides needed funding for grants through the Small Business Administration  Unfortunately  the Appropriations Committee recommends that the SBA direct funding to 53 specific programs named in the Committee report  It is imperative  in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  that SBA grants be awarded on the basis of need and merit and not on the whim of a Member of Congress  despite what might be the best of intentions   The Sense of the Senate amendment that I am proposing would allow funding for earmarks that have not been authorized  have not been requested by the President  or are not related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina to be redirected to recovery efforts  This would occur if the agency or department head determines  after consultation with the appropriate Congressional Committees  that such an earmark is not of national significance or is not in the public interest   I appreciate the helpful efforts of Senator Shelby and his staff to secure the adoption of this modest amendment  I hope it can be easily adopted and not to take much of the Senates time  I could propose the impossible  that no earmarks be permitted in any appropriations bill  period  But I am not proposing the impossible  Or  I could propose what is suggested almost daily by the press that Congress turn in its pork  Many are rightly calling into question the thousands of projects in the highway bill  and suggesting the related project funding should more wisely be transferred to recovery efforts  The amendment isnt proposing that either  But perhaps next time  that will be the proposal I offer  particularly if  given the dire situation in the gulf  we cant even agree to preclude funding for projects that arent found to be in the public interest   Mr  President  this is a modest proposal  I would hope that my colleagues would overwhelmingly adopt it for the sake of those tens of thousands Americans who have lost almost everything and are relying on their government for necessary support as they struggle for what will be a long and difficult time  I call upon the appropriators and the leadership to pay careful attention to the funding measures yet to be debated and to do their part to ensure we are living up to our obligations to those who are suffering  even if it means that it comes at some of our personal political expense and ability to issue a press release on what weve delivered to our home state   Mr  President  in a time of national catastrophe  it is the responsibility of the United States Congress to take quick and decisive action to help those in need  It is not appropriate to continue the practice of earmarking scarce funds in the face of such a great tragedy  This should be a time of sacrifice for the sake of our suffering citizens                                                      September 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
