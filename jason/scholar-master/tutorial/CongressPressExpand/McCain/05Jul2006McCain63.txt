                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON IMMIGRANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO U S  MILITARY July 10  2006 Miami  Florida    Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following remarks before a field hearing on immigrant contributions to the United States Military conducted by the Senate Armed Services Committee   I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Warner  Ranking Member Levin  and the Committee Members for holding this hearing regarding the importance of immigrants in our armed services   As everyone knows  Congress has been engaged in an immigration debate for over a year now  I would like to begin by saying that any reform that is ultimately adopted by both bodies of Congress and signed in to law by the President must address all aspects of the immigration debate  It cannot  should not  and will not be an enforcement only policy  An enforcement only strategy will not make our nation safer or more economically sound  Though our hearing today will primarily focus on one aspect of the contributions immigrants make in our society  we cannot lose sight of the fact that our nation cannot survive as a leader in this world without the lifeblood and vitality provided by immigrants  It is not enough to secure our borders and go home  We must recognize this need for immigration in our country and deal with those immigrants that are already here in a humane  fair and just way  Immigration reform is a very important and complex subject that is among the most difficult and divisive we face  And without comprehensive immigration reform  our nation s security and economy are vulnerable   Those of us from Border States witness every day the impact illegal immigration is having on our friends and neighbors  our county and city services  our economy and our environment  We deal with the degradation of our lands and the demands imposed on our hospitals and other public resources  It is a matter of life and death for many living along the border  We have hundreds of people flowing across our borders every day and an estimated 11 12 million people living in the shadows in every state in our country  Our current system doesn t protect us from people who want to harm us  It does not meet the needs of our economy  And it leaves too many people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse   Mr  Chairman  we need immigrants in this country  The current immigration system does not adequately and lawfully address this need  As long as this situation exists  without a legal path for immigrants to enter the country  we will have desperate people illegally crossing our borders and living in the shadows of our towns  cities and rural communities  That is not acceptable  particularly when we are fighting the war on terror  The vast majority of individuals attempting to cross our borders do not intend to harm our country  they are coming to meet our demand for labor and to earn money to feed their families  We have seen time and again that as long as there are jobs available in this country for people who live in poverty and hopelessness in other countries  those people will risk their lives to cross our borders    no matter how formidable the barriers    and most will be successful  By the Border Patrol s own estimates  99 percent of those apprehended coming across the border are doing so for work  However  the Border Patrol is overwhelmed by these individuals  They cannot possibly apprehend every crosser being smuggled in  no matter how many resources we provide  That is why any new immigration law must establish a legal channel for immigrants to enter the United States after they have passed background checks and have secured employment  Then we can free up federal officials to focus on those individuals intending to do harm through drug smuggling  human trafficking and terrorism   Throughout our nation s history  immigrants have proven to be hard working  ingenuitive  and prosperous  The armed services provide a unique opportunity and ability for immigrants to better their place and position  More than 20 percent of the recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor  the nation s highest decoration  have been immigrants  The creation of the submarine  the helicopter  and the ironclad ship all resulted from newcomers to our country  Additionally  during World War II  a combat team made up of the sons of Japanese immigrants was the most decorated regiment of its size  Some of our most decorated and famous serviceman  including former Secretary of State Colin Powell  are first generation Americans or immigrants themselves  At this time I would like to read a letter submitted for this hearing by Secretary Powell    Dear Chairman Warner   I am pleased to hear that the Senate Armed Services Committee will be convening a hearing regarding the contributions of immigrants to our armed services  I deeply appreciate your invitation to give testimony and regret being unable to attend  I hope you will permit me to convey my experiences as the son of immigrants and articulate both the important role immigrants  service plays in our armed forces and the need to enact comprehensive immigration reform   My parents  Luther and Maud Powell  emigrated from Jamaica in the 1920s and settled in a neighborhood in the South Bronx  New York  My father worked as a shipping clerk  my mother a seamstress  I grew up surrounded by two cultures and took pride in my immigrant roots  Upon graduating from college I took a commission in the Army and found  in that institution  opportunities to strive and succeed beyond my imagination   From the greens of Lexington and Concord to the sands of Iraq  Americans have continually answered the call to arms and successfully defended our way of life  I am proud that much of that military success can be attributed to the contributions of immigrants  The burden of defending our ideals and freedom has always been shared by those who were not yet citizens  I have witnessed time and again the bravery and valor of soldiers defending a country that they consider their adopted home  They are grateful for the opportunities the United States provides and we are grateful for their sacrifices   As President Bush has stated  our nation is in desperate need of an overhaul of our immigration laws  This must be done in a comprehensive manner to ensure that we provide the same opportunities for future immigrants as were available to my parents  While we ensure our national security and secure our boarders  we must also recognize the socially  economically  and culturally revitalizing force immigrants play in America   America s diversity is the basis for its greatness  and we are a country that prides itself on our openness to change  Those wishing to cause us harm cannot alter this fundamental American ideal  and in order to preserve it  we must continue to embrace those who come to our shores  not just those who have already benefited from the American dream   Again  thank you for the opportunity to add my voice to this important discussion   Sincerely   Colin Powell   I am hopeful that at the end of the immigration debate  we can show the American people that we addressed a serious and urgent problem with sound judgment  honesty  common sense and compassion  We must address immigration reform in a comprehensive  yes  comprehensive manner  We cannot throw money at our borders and call it a day  If all we do is attempt to secure our borders and nothing else  we will have failed the American people  I have no doubt that we will learn today of the sacrifices that many immigrants have made for their adopted home  If we do not provide the same opportunities for future immigrants that were provided for our forefathers  it is an affront to our national ideals  We owe these servicemen more for the sacrifices they have made for this great country   In closing  I urge Congress to move forward in a thoughtful  productive manner and call on both Houses to put the rhetoric and demogagory aside and sit down for meaningful discussions  It is past time to act and the American people are losing patience                                                      July 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
