                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON S  1789  DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION  AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT  AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT  2008 September 12  2007 Washington  D C  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record on the Departments of Transportation  and Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies Appropriations Act  2008     Mr  President  the bill before us is a budget buster  It is over  3 billion above the Presidents budget request and contains numerous earmarked projects  worth over  2 billion  It should be soundly rejected     Mr  President  funding for transportation infrastructure and transportation safety is of enormous importance and I know all of us support doing what we can to improve our nations transportation system  from our roads and bridges to our air service  The tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota in August was a harsh reminder of just how critical our responsibilities are to balance competing transportation funding needs  But we simply must do so in a fiscally responsible manner  The Senates action Monday to increase the obligation limitation for the highway trust fund by  1 billion is not the answer nor was it responsible  It might have been politically expedient  but it is not the answer     We cannot afford to simply spend more and more of taxpayers hard earned dollars without consequences  It is time for Congress to start making choices among competing priorities  just as American families do each month with their family budgets  In this bill  we are not underfunding transportation  Mr  President  we are misdirecting infrastructure funding to earmarked projects that are questionable and certainly not urgently needed     According to the Reason Foundations 16th Annual Highway Performance Report  24 percent of our nations bridges were deficient or obsolete in 2005  Minnesota actually ranked 5th best in the nation  yet we watched with horror as one of the states major thoroughfares crumbled from disrepair  The Wall Street Journal reported on August 22  2007  that a week before the bridge collapse  a Congressman from Minnesota inserted over  10 million in earmarks for rail transit  bike trails and the Kids Peace Mesabi Academy  but not a penny for bridge or infrastructure repair     In addition to our aging bridges  our interstate highway system is over 50 years old and not equipped to handle todays traffic levels  So what has Congress done in response to this reality  We have increased earmarking of our highway program funding by a staggering level      The 1982 highway bill included 10 demonstration projects totaling  386 million     The 1987 highway bill included 152 demonstration projects totaling  1 4 billion     The 1991 highway bill included 538 location specific projects totaling  6 1 billion     The 1998 highway bill included 1 850 earmarked projects totaling  9 3 billion  and    The 2005 highway bill included over 5 634 earmarked projects totaling  21 6 billion      So instead of allowing states the ability to allocate their highway dollars to their most pressing needs  like deficient bridges  we are funding a significantly higher level of bike paths and highway beautification projects and sidewalk improvements  When will we learn  Mr  President  When will we learn that this is not what the American people want or deserve from their elected representatives  How many more infrastructure tragedies will occur before we change our earmarking ways     Instead of raising the gas taxes  as some members of Congress have suggested  for the millions of Americans who are already paying more for gas than ever before  the Federal and state governments must prioritize transportation spending to focus on projects with the most need rather than building bridges to nowhere  If Congress fails to recover from its addiction to earmarks  then crumbling bridges  congested highways  and crowded airports will continue much to the determent of all Americans     Congress recently passed an ethics reform bill that requires the disclosure of the authorship of earmarks  Ninety one members of this body requested transportation earmarks in this appropriations bill  For example  this bill contains  4 million for a bridge in Arkansas that does not appear in the Arkansas state transportation improvement plan  thereby questioning its necessity  The bill also includes almost  2 million for a study on the effects of dust suppressant chemicals on federal highways   2 million above the Administrations request for volcano monitoring in Alaska  and  2 million to prevent the frequent U turns at the gates of the Los Alamos labs in New Mexico     Of course  the bill includes a wide range of transportation earmarks  The bill also contains  8 million for airport improvements to Cape Cod and Nantucket   2 5M for improvements at the Niagara Falls International Airport  and  1 5 million for improvements at the airport in Palm Springs  CA  No doubt these popular tourist destinations could have helped to pay for these improvements themselves rather then requiring all taxpayers to subsidize such marvelous destinations that many taxpayers may never be able to afford to visit     The bill also provides  3 5 million to construct an airport in Akutan  AK  pop  767  when an alternative airport is less than 55 miles away and  1 million for airport improvements at Lewis University  IL  for its 1 000 students  There are also earmarks for ferry service  such as  1 million for Nassau County  NY  which is the sixth richest county in the nation  Again  taxpayers nationwide must support and sustain these projects despite their use by a few     Mr  President  the underlying bill provides funding for the Department of Transportations one year pilot program that would allow a maximum of 100 Mexican trucks to enter and travel to a single destination in the United States this year  This pilot program is the result of planning and preparation over the past 14 years  NAFTA  passed by Congress in 1993 and signed into law by President Clinton in 1994  mandated the opening of our southern border to Mexican trucking operations  Congress set forth stringent pre conditions for opening the border in Sec  350 of the FY02 transportation appropriations bill  and DOT complied with all 22 of those requirements  The Inspector General has reported five times that the Department has substantially met those safety requirements  It is now time to allow these two countries to move forward with this one year pilot program that will have numerous economic benefits for the two nations  Unfortunately  the Senate has voted 74 to 24 to prevent the pilot from going forward  As such  we continue to fall short of abiding by the obligations we committed to when we approved NAFTA     In addition to my concerns with the transportation title  this bill provides more than  3 billion above the Presidents budget request for the Department of Housing and Urban Development  Like previous years  the accompanying report contains an enormous number of earmarks in the Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative Accounts to the tune of more than 300 earmarks totaling nearly  300 million     Mr  President  again  I would like to express my disappointment that Senate leadership has brought to the floor a bill that is  3 billion over the Administrations request containing hundreds of earmarks  Rightly  the Administration has announced that the President will veto this bill unless its price tag is reduced  That is the correct action     During my recent travels around the nation  I hear again and again from citizens who are fed up with pork barrel spending and yet  Congress fails to listen  It is a shame  Mr  President  and I can only hope that the American people will join me in expressing their displeasure with this bill                                             September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
