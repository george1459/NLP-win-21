January 23  2007 Washington  D C     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following opening remarks during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the nomination of General David Petraeus to become the top Commander in Iraq       General Petraeus  I join Chairman Levin in welcoming you here today and congratulating you on your nomination      It is hard to imagine a more important military nomination than that of General David Petraeus  General  you know better than others the stakes in this war  the benefits of success and the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure  You  having literally written the book on counterinsurgency  understand the strategy and tactics that must guide the President   s increase in U S  force levels  And you  General  will have great responsibility for the course of future American actions in Iraq  But to state the obvious  your job will be very difficult      We have made many mistakes in this war  From the initial invasion  we had too few troops in Iraq  and we never redressed this deficiency  We played    whack a mole    instead of clearing and holding  We adopted an inadequate and unrealistic    light footprint    coalition strategy that focused on turning over to Iraqis missions that they were plainly unable to complete       Administration officials  frequently and repeatedly  issued unjustifiably optimistic assessments and predictions about the situation in Iraq  And we responded ineffectively to the hostile actions of Sunni  Shia  and foreign fighters alike and the vagaries of the Iraqi government      It is somewhat dismaying that only now  after nearly four years at war in Iraq  is the United States moving toward a traditional counterinsurgency strategy aimed first at the protection of the Iraqi population and supported by troop levels appropriate to their mission  Whether the projected surge is sufficient to accomplish all that our leaders will ask of our troops remains an open question in my mind  and I look forward to the General   s testimony on this score  But I believe that the fundamental components of the new strategy are needed in Iraq  and that they have been necessary for a long time       By quelling the violence in Baghdad and  with your leadership  improving our training and reinforcement efforts  we will allow the economic and political process to move forward and create a situation which will permit confidence and optimism  And while I believe that this will present a solid chance of success  I would note again that the new plan does not  on its own  guarantee success  Bringing down the violence in Iraq will help give Prime Minister Maliki and others the political space they need to pursue reconciliation  but it is up to the Iraqis to make these tough decisions  It is absolutely imperative that they seize this opportunity  It may well be their last       We have needed new military leadership in Iraq for some time  and there is no one in the U S  military better suited to implement the President   s new strategy than General Petraeus  I am confident that you will receive broad support in the Senate  as will Admiral Fallon  who has been nominated as the next head of Central Command       General Petraeus  it is absolutely essential that the Senate act promptly on your nomination  I hope that  following Senate action  the President will direct you to take the next flight to Iraq and assume command  Your role is that important       If confirmed  this will be your third assignment in Iraq since the war began in March 2003  You led the 101st Airborne Division with great distinction in northern Iraq in 2003  and you were later recognized for making significant improvements in the training of the Iraqi Security Forces after a slow start and missteps during the early months of the Coalition Provisional Authority       Most recently  as Commander of the U S  Army   s Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth  you led the development of the Army   s doctrine for military operations in a counterinsurgency environment  This revised doctrine is designed to merge traditional approaches to counterinsurgency operations with the realities of the 21st century and to incorporate lessons learned from previous counterinsurgencies and contemporary operations       Mr  Chairman  in the forward to the new field manual  General Petraeus wrote that    conducting a successful counterinsurgency campaign requires a flexible  adaptive force led by agile  well informed  culturally astute leaders     I believe that this committee has just such a leader before it today  and that he is someone we can look to for leadership in this  America   s final chance to prevail in Iraq        General  I thank you and your family for the sacrifices you have made and your career of selfless service to our nation  I look forward to your testimony today                                                January 2007 Press Releases
