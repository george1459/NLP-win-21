                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF FUNDS TRANSPARENCY ACT March 16  2006 Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  testified before the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  Government Information  and International Security on the Obligations of Funds Transparency Act and submitted the following statement for the record   Mr  Chairman  I want to begin by thanking you  not only for holding this hearing today  but for your tireless work on behalf of the American taxpayer  Your fight to eliminate waste and abuse in the federal government is an honorable one  and I am happy to join you in those efforts  I m pleased that both you and Sen  Kyl joined me in offering S  1495  the Obligation of Funds Transparency Act last July  This is a very important piece of legislation  and it is imperative that we work to move it to the Senate floor for a vote  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of my fellow Arizonan  Rep  Flake  for introducing the companion bill in the House of Representatives   H R  1642   As all of my colleagues know  the process of earmarking funds in the annual appropriations bills has lurched out of control  According to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service  CRS   in 1994  there were 4 126 Congressional earmarks added to the annual appropriations bills  In 2006  there were 12 852 earmarks  The level of funding associated with those earmarks has risen from  23 2 billion in FY 1994 to over  64 billion in FY 2006   To address this growing problem  I was recently joined by my colleagues Senators Feingold  Coburn  Bayh  Sununu  Graham  Ensign  DeMint  Kyl  and Cornyn in introducing S  2265  the Pork Barrel Reduction Act  This bipartisan bill would establish a new procedure under Rule XVI  modeled in part after the Byrd Rule  which would allow a 60 vote point of order to be raised against specific provisions that contain unauthorized appropriations  including earmarks  as well as unauthorized policy changes in appropriations bills and conference reports  Of importance is that successful points of order would not kill a conference report  but the targeted provisions would be deemed removed from the conference report  and the measure would be sent back for concurrence by the House   Additionally  to ensure that Members are given enough time to review appropriations bills  our proposal would also require that conference reports be available at least 48 hours prior to floor consideration  It also prohibits the consideration of a conference report if it includes matter outside the scope of conference   As you well know  Mr  Chairman  our bill also includes the provisions of S  1495  which would prohibit Federal agencies from obligating funds for appropriations earmarks included only in congressional reports  which are not amendable  While many may not see it as an important distinction  where an earmark is placed is of great importance  What we have found  is that the overwhelming majority of earmarks are found in report language   and  if I may remind my colleagues  report language DOES NOT have the force of law  Reports and the Statements of Managers which accompany bills and conference reports are to serve merely as explanations for the actions of the committee and the time has come to make it clear to all federal agencies that they should not be interpreting report language as law   In a recent report on earmarks  CRS said Most of these earmarks  however  are included in the Senate and House Appropriations Committees  reports explaining a measure as reported  These earmarks are also frequently included in the managers  joint explanatory statement  or managers  statement  that accompanies the conference report  Committee reports and managers  statements do not have statutory force  departments and agencies are not legally bound by their declarations  In an attempt to draw attention to this often overlooked fact  last week I joined Chairman Coburn as well as Senators DeMint  Feingold  and Bayh in writing to President Bush to urge him to instruct his cabinet to ignore wasteful earmarks that are contained in any statement of managers  that accompanies a bill he signs into law   In our letter to the President we wrote As you know  the executive branch has the authority to exercise discretion in funding these projects  The agency can either fund the projects as prescribed in the committee reports or subject them to an open and competitive review  CRS recently found that over 95 percent of the earmarks in the Fiscal Year 2006 budget were not written into law  If your Administration would reject even some of the most wasteful earmarks  it would ensure that scarce federal funds are spent on national priorities and it would make it substantially more difficult for Congress to load up annual spending bills with earmarks  Mr  Chairman  or bill  S  1495  is only one of several measures that have been introduced to address the growing problem of Congressional earmarks  As I have said  the time has come to tighten our belts around here  We have an obligation to future generations of American taxpayers  We must remember that everything we do today will impact them and it is grossly unfair of us to saddle them with a deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars just so we can issue a press release to curry favor with the folks back home   Again  Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing today on this important issue and for inviting me to share my views  I am pleased to be working with you  S  1495 is a good bill and will go a long way in helping to protect the taxpayer s dollars   I am proud to be sponsoring it with you    end                                              March 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
