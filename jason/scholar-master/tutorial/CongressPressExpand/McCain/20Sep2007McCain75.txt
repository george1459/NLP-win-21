                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON FEINGOLD AMENDMENT TO CUT OFF FUNDS FOR IRAQ September 20  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today gave the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding the Feingold Amendment to cut off funding for the troops in Iraq     Mr  President  I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my good friend  the Senator from Wisconsin     The pending amendment would mandate a withdrawal of U S  combat forces within 90 days of enactment and cut off funds for our troops in Iraq after June 30  2008  The one exception would be for a small force authorized only to carry out narrowly defined missions     The Senate  once again  faces a simple choice  Do we build on the successes of our new strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and support needed to carry out their mission  or do we ignore the realities on the ground and legislate a premature end to our efforts in Iraq  accepting thereby all the terrible consequences that will ensue     That is the choice we must make  Mr  President  and though politics and popular opinion may be pushing us in one direction  we have a greater responsibility  the duty to make decisions with the security of this great and good nation foremost in our minds  We now have the benefit of the long anticipated testimony delivered by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  testimony that reported unambiguously that the new strategy is succeeding in Iraq  Understanding what we now know  that our military is making progress on the ground  and that their commanders request from us the time and support necessary to succeed in Iraq  it is inconceivable that we in Congress would end this strategy just as it is beginning to show real results     We see today that  after nearly four years of mismanaged war  the situation on the ground in Iraq is showing demonstrable signs of progress  The final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus new counter insurgency plan have been in place for over two months and our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  is making significant gains in a number of areas     General Petraeus reported in detail on these gains during his testimony in both houses and in countless interviews  The number two U S  commander in Iraq  Lt  Gen  Ray Odierno  said today that the seven month old security operation has reduced violence in Baghdad by some 50 percent  that car bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have fallen to their lowest level in a year  and that civilian casualties have dropped from a high of 32 per day to 12 per day  His comments were echoed by Lt  Gen  Abboud Qanbar  the Iraqi commander  who said that before the surge began  one third of Baghdads 507 districts were under insurgent control  Today  he said  only five to six districts can be called hot areas     None of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have suddenly become safe  or that violence has come down to acceptable levels  As General Odierno pointed out  violence is still too high and there are many unsafe areas  Nevertheless  such positive developments illustrate General Petraeus contention last week that American and Iraqi forces have achieved substantial progress under their new strategy     The road in Iraq remains  as it always has been  long and hard  The Maliki government remains paralyzed and unwilling to function as it must  and other difficulties abound  No one can guarantee success or be certain about its prospects  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Congress succeed in terminating the strategy by legislating an abrupt withdrawal and a transition to a new  less effective and more dangerous course  should we do that  Mr  President  then we will fail for certain     Let us make no mistake about the costs of such an American failure in Iraq  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement  If we leave  we will be back  in Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure     In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee last week  General Petraeus referred to an August Defense Intelligence Agency report that stated  a rapid withdrawal would result in the further release of strong centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a number of dangerous results  including a high risk of disintegration of the Iraqi Security Forces  a rapid deterioration of local security initiatives  al Qaeda Iraq regaining lost ground and freedom of maneuver  a marked increase in violence and further ethno sectarian displacement and refugee flows  and exacerbation of already challenging regional dynamics  especially with respect to Iran     Those are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal  and I hope that the supporters of such a move will tell us how they intend to address the chaos and catastrophe that would surely follow such a course of action  Should this amendment become law  and U S  troops begin withdrawing  do they believe that Iraq will become more or less stable  That the Iraqi people become more or less safe  That genocide becomes a more remote possibility or ever likelier  That al Qaeda will find it easier to gather  plan  and carry out attacks from Iraqi soil  or that our withdrawal will somehow make this less likely     No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality of Iraq to the war on terror  there can simply be no debate that our efforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against violent Islamic extremism  Earlier this month  General Jim Jones testified before the Armed Services Committee and outlined what he believes to be the consequences of such a course        a precipitous departure which results in a failed state in Iraq  he said  will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists  jihadists       in the world  who will believe that they will have toppled the major power on Earth and that all else is possible  And I think it will not only make us less safe  it will make our friends and allies less safe  And the struggle will continue  It will simply be done in different and in other areas    Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability  we invite chaos  genocide  terrorist safehavens and regional war  We invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons  training fighters  providing resources  and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq  If any of my colleagues remain unsure of Irans intentions in the region  may I direct them to the recent remarks of the Iranian president  who said  The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly      Soon  we will see a huge power vacuum in the region  Of course  we are prepared to fill the gap  If our notions of national security have any meaning  they cannot include permitting the establishment of an Iranian dominated Middle East that is roiled by wider regional war and riddled with terrorist safehavens     The supporters of this amendment respond that they do not by any means intend to cede the battlefield to al Qaeda  on the contrary  their legislation would allow U S  forces  presumably holed up in forward operating bases  to carry out targeted operations  limited in duration and scope  against members of al Qaeda and other international terrorist organizations  But such a provision draws a false distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence  Let us think about the implications of ordering American soldiers to target terrorists  but not those who foment sectarian violence  Was the attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a terrorist operation or the expression of sectarian violence  When the Madhi Army attacks government police stations  are they acting as terrorists or as a militia  When AQI attacks a Shia village along the Diyala River  is that terrorism or sectarian violence  What about when an American soldier comes across some unknown assailant burying an IED in the road  Must he check for an al Qaeda identity card before responding     The obvious answer is that such acts very often constitute terrorism in Iraq and sectarian violence in Iraq  The two are deeply intertwined  To try and make an artificial distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence is to fundamentally misunderstand al Qaedas strategywhich is to incite sectarian violence  It is interesting that some supporters of this amendment embraced the recent GAO report  which said that it could not distinguish between sectarian violence and other forms of violence because that would require determining intent  an impossible task  Yet these same supporters would have our troops in the field attempt to do just that  Our military commanders say that trying to artificially separate counterterrorism from counterinsurgency will not succeed  and that moving in with search and destroy missions to kill and capture terrorists  only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy  is the failed strategy of the past four years  We should not  and must not  return to such a disastrous course     The strategy that General Petraeus has put into place  a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protecting the population  which gets our troops out of the bases and into the areas they are trying to protect  and which supplies sufficient force levels to carry out the mission  that strategy is the correct one  It has become clear by now that we cannot set a date for withdrawal without setting a date for surrender     Mr  President  this fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq alone  It is greater than that and more important still  about whether America still has the political courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for defeat  with all of the terrible things that accompany it  We cannot walk away gracefully from defeat in this war     Consider just one final statement from the August National Intelligence Estimate  It reads     We assess that changing the mission of the Coalition forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role to a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and counterterrorist operations to prevent AQI from establishing a safehaven would erode any security gains achieved thus far     Should we pass this amendment  we would erode the security gains that our brave men and women have fought so hard to achieve and embark on the road of surrender  For the sake of American interests  our national values  the future of Iraq and the stability of the Middle East  we must not send our country down this disastrous course  All of us want our troops to come home  and to come home as soon as possible  But we should want our soldiers to return to us with honor  the honor of victory that is due all of those who have paid with the ultimate sacrifice  We have many responsibilities to the people who elected us  but one responsibility outweighs all the others  and that is to protect this great and good nation from all enemies foreign and domestic  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Feingold amendment                                             September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
