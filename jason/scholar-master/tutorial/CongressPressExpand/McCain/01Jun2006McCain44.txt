2006 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today gave the following address about the deplorable leadership and oppression exercised by Burma s dictatorship following the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi   Mr  President  every so often a clarifying moment in international affairs reminds us of the stakes involved in a particular conflict  and of our moral obligation to stand with those who risk their lives for the principles of freedom  The violent crackdown against Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters over the weekend underscores the brutal and unreconstructed character of Burma s dictatorship  The assault should remind democrats everywhere that we must actively support her struggle to deliver the human rights and freedom of a people long denied them by an oppressive military regime   The arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi following a coordinated  armed attack against her and her supporters is a reminder to the world that Burma s military junta has neither legitimacy nor limits on its power to crush peaceful dissent  The junta insists it stepped in to restore order following armed clashes between members of Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy and unnamed opponents  In fact  the regime s forces had been harassing Suu Kyi and the NLD for months  The junta s Union Solidarity Development Association orchestrated and staged last weekend s attack  killing at least 70 of her supporters and injuring Suu Kyi herself  perhaps seriously  Credible reports suggest that the regime s thugs targeted Suu Kyi personally  She is now being held incommunicado by Burmese military intelligence  her party offices have been closed  many of its activists are missing  and universities have been shut down  After having spent most of the last 14 years under house arrest  Ms  Suu Kyi is  one again  a political prisoner   Aung San Suu Kyi is one of the world s most courageous champions of freedom  I join advocates of a free Burma everywhere in expressing outrage at her unwarranted detention and call for her immediate  unconditional release  and the freedom to travel and speak throughout her country   Closing party offices  shuttering universities  and detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party in the name of protecting her demonstrate how estranged the junta is from its own people  and how potent are Suu Kyi s appeals for democratic change in a nation that resoundingly endorsed her in democratic elections 13 years ago  The junta s decision to release her from house arrest a year ago  and to permit her to speak and travel within tightly circumscribed limits  appeared to reflect the generals  calculation that her popular appeal had diminished  and that perhaps her fighting spirit had flagged  They could not have been more wrong   Aung San Suu Kyi remains the legitimately elected and overwhelmingly popular leader of her country  Even though she was under house arrest in 1990  her party captured 82 percent of the vote  shocking the generals  Neither the huge majority of the Burmese people who voted for the NLD nor the international community have forgotten how Burma s junta rejected the election results  nor how the regime s forces massacred its own people at a democratic rally two years earlier  We have not forgotten the many political prisoners who remain in Burma s jails  or the repression Burma s people have endured for decades  The assault on Burma s free political future at the hands of the regime last weekend has reminded us of what we already knew  the junta cannot oversee the reform and opening of Burma  for it remains the biggest obstacle to the freedom and prosperity of the Burmese people  Burma cannot change as long as the junta rules  without restraint or remorse   Despite these obvious truths  of which we have been reminded again this week  some countries have chosen to pursue policies of political and commercial engagement with the government in Rangoon on the grounds that working with and through the junta would have a more significant liberalizing effect than isolating and sanctioning it  ASEAN admitted Burma in 1997  Beijing has enjoyed warm relations with Rangoon  and most countries trade with it  only the United States and Europe impose mild sanctions against the regime  Proponents of engagement pointed to the nascent dialogue between Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime  and her release from house arrest last May  as indicators that perhaps external influence was having some beneficial effect on the dictatorship  But advocates of engagement have little to show for it following last weekend s assault on the democrats   Burma s junta must understand quite clearly that it will not enjoy business as usual following its brutal attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD  It is time for the international community to acknowledge that the status quo serves nobody s interests except those of the regime  Burma s people suffer  its neighbors are embarrassed  companies cannot do the kind of business they would with a free and developing Burma  the drug lords flourish in a vacuum of governance  and the situation inside the country grows more unstable as the regime s misrule increasingly radicalizes and impoverishes its people   No country or leader motivated by the welfare of the Burmese people  a desire for regional stability and prosperity  or concern for Burma s place among nations can maintain that rule by the junta serves these interests  I find it hard to believe that any democratic government would stand by the junta as it takes Burma on a forced march back in time  Yet this morning  when asked about the weekend s assault  the Japanese Foreign Minister denied that the situation in Burma was getting worse  said progress is being made toward democratization  and announced that Japan has no intention of changing its policy on Burma  Music to the junta s ears  perhaps  but I believe friends of the Burmese people must take a radically different  and principled  approach to a problem that kind words will only exacerbate   The world cannot stand by as the ruination of this country continues any farther  Free Burma s leaders  and her people  will remember which nations stood with them in their struggle against oppression  and which nations seemed to side with their oppressors   American and international policy towards Burma should reflect our conviction that oppression and impunity must come to an end  and that the regime must move towards a negotiated settlement with Aung San Suu Kyi that grants her a leading and irreversible political role culminating in free and fair national elections  If it does not  the regime will not be able to manage the transition  when it does come  for it will come without its consent   I believe the United States should immediately expand the visa ban against Burmese officials to include all members of the Union Solidarity Development Association  which organized the attack against Aung San Suu Kyi s delegation last weekend  The Administration should also immediately issue an executive order freezing the U S  assets of Burmese leaders  U N  special envoy Razali Ismail should not travel to Burma as planned this week unless he has assurances from the regime that he will be able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi   Congress should promptly consider legislation banning Burmese imports into the United States  and the Administration should encourage the European Union to back up its commitment to human rights in Burma with concrete steps in this direction  The U S  and the E U  together account for over 50 percent of Burma s exports and therefore enjoy considerable leverage against the regime  The United States alone absorbs between 20 and 25 percent of Burma s exports  Consideration of a U S  import ban should help focus attention in Rangoon on the consequences of flagrantly violating the human rights of the Burmese people and their chosen leaders  In coordination with a new U S  initiative  an E U  move in the direction of punitive trade sanctions would make the regime s continuing repression difficult if not impossible to sustain   The junta s latest actions are a desperate attempt by a decaying regime to stall freedom s inevitable progress  in Burma and across Asia  They will fail as surely as Aung San Suu Kyi s campaign for a free Burma will one day succeed                                                   June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
