BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007 September 7  2006 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2007  Mr  President  I rise today to address the Senate concerning the legislation before us  the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2007  This bill is particularly important in this time of ongoing war  structural changes in the force  and an aging veteran population  The Committee has worked to produce a bill that  while imperfect  addresses many of the issues that challenge our armed services and veterans  and I thank them for their work    Mr  President  America remains at war  a war that continues to unite Americans in pursuit of a common goal B to defeat terrorism  Americans have and will continue to make sacrifices for this war  Our servicemen and women in particular are truly on the front lines in this war  separated from their families  risking their lives  and working extraordinarily long hours under the most difficult conditions to accomplish the ambitious but necessary task their country has set for them    It is important that we understand the context of this years military construction legislation  Three processes are playing out simultaneously that require reasoned and appropriate Congressional action on this bill  First  Americas struggle for peace in Iraq continues  Second  our largest service  the Army  is undertaking significant structural changes and redeploying thousands of troops  Third  the recent round of Base Realignment and Closure round that streamlined the defense infrastructure is now being implemented  These three issues have defined the requirements of the legislation before us  The Committee has recognized the challenges and outlined military construction spending that  in large part  meets them    I am pleased to note that the Appropriations Committee has met the spending level requested by the Administration for the Department of Veterans Affairs  This is particularly important in light of the growing numbers of young veterans who look to the VA for care  To date more than 184 000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have sought care through the VA  Of that number  30 000 have been found to exhibit symptoms similar to post traumatic stress or PTSD  and I applaud the Committees support for PTSD programs and funding  This legislation also provides  32 7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2007  nearly equivalent to the Presidents request    I want to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies for her willingness to work with the Senate Armed Services Committee  SASC  to ensure this bill generally funds MILCON projects consistent with the authorizing committees views  The Chairman has always made a considerable effort to work with the authorizers to mitigate differences in the defense funding and authorizing bills    In particular  I appreciate the Chairmans efforts to remove an unrequested and unauthorized MILCON project for Lackland Air Force Base after I brought my concerns to her attention  That project was not requested by the Administration nor is it listed in the Air Forces Unfunded Priority List  UPL   It was added only after the Air Force Chief of Staff sought the funding outside the regular process  without the concurrence of DoD or OMB  and without any notification to or feedback from the authorizing Committees    When the authoring committees finally learned about this project  we had already completed committee markups and passed defense authorization bills in both chambers  The authorizing committees refused to add an out of scope provision into the final conference report to authorize this Air Force earmark and as such  the Chairman has since agreed to remove it from the pending bill in a mangers amendment on the Senate floor   I wanted to spend time on the Senate floor to highlight this Air Force MILCON earmark because it demonstrates how authorizers and appropriators can and should work together  While ideally the provision would never have been included in the bill since it wasnt requested  the Chairman was more than willing to listen to my concerns as an authorizer and she acted most appropriately by agreeing to remove the earmark  Again  I thank Senator Hutchison for her steadfast leadership and accommodation of the authorization committees wishes   Unfortunately  the bill before us is not entirely free of earmarks  I am concerned that  while this bill is some  434 million below the Administrations request  it nonetheless recommends almost  90 million in unrequested spending that is directed at unauthorized projects  While I recognize that many of the earmarks added to this legislation may sound worthwhile  they do not belong in the bill or its report  Needless to say  it is distressing that in this time of fiscal constraints  lawmakers continue to earmark military funds while under funding the Presidents overall request   Let me mention a few examples of money earmarked in the committee report for specific projects that were not requested by the Department of Defense   1 5 million for a General Instruction Building in Fort Lewis  Washington   1 5 million for Officers Quarters in the Ravenna  Ohio   1 5 million for a Dining Facility at Camp Roberts in San Miguel  California   3 4 million for an Aviation Readiness Center at Helena Regional Airport  Montana   1 4 million for an Engine Shop in Fort Worth  Texas   900 000 for an Information Technology Complex at Wright Patterson AFB  Ohio   2 0 million for a Regional Training Institute in West Virginia   Almost all the earmarked money will go to the states represented by members of the Committee  These examples  Mr  President  are only part of the nearly  60 million in unrequested earmarks that siphon funds away from important programs needed for enhancing our war fighting capability  This means  Mr  President  that the armed services have come to us with urgent needs and we have responded by giving them less than what they asked for while requiring that they spend it to suit our parochial needs rather than military necessity    The problems facing our active and retired veterans  whether in the form of force structure or modernization or enhancing quality of life benefits  are properly addressed in a deliberative budget process  However  we should think twice before diverting money away from military necessities to fund home state projects  The American taxpayer expects more of us  as do our brave servicemen and women who are fighting this war on global terrorism on our behalf   I yield the floor    list attached below                                    Related Files               9706MilitaryConstructionAppropsFY07PorkList pdf
