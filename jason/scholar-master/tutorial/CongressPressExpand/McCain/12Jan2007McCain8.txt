                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN REMARKS ON CLIMATE STEWARDSHIP ACT OF 2007 January 12  2007 Washington  DC   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the record regarding the Climate Stewardship Act of 2007    Mr  President  I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman today  along with our co sponsors  Senators Snowe  Obama  Collins  and Lincoln  in introducing the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007  This legislation is designed to significantly reduce the Nation s greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the dangerous impacts of climate change  enhance our national security and maintain the strength of our economy  It would be accomplished through a combination of trading markets and the deployment of advanced technologies     Mr  President  as I have stated on previous occasions  the design of this legislation is an evolving process  The legislation we are introducing today represents yet another step in that effort  Since our last vote on this legislation  Senator Lieberman and I have continued work on this proposal with the goal of producing the most innovative  meaningful  and economically feasible measure that can be embraced by the Senate  We believe the changes which we have made since we first introduced climate change legislation in the 108th Congress puts us on the path to achieving this goal  and we intend to make further improvements to this comprehensive legislation in the days ahead     We have continually worked with scientists  industry  environmentalists  as well as the faith based community  to ensure that we are fully addressing the serious problem of global warming  We continue to learn more about the science and the impacts of climate change on a daily basis  We continue to work with economists and industry experts to ensure that our emissions goals do not hamstring our economic objectives  In particular  we continue to learn more about the power of the markets to control costs as emission credit trading continues in Europe and here in the U S  I am confident that given the will  the federal government can be a lead advocate for ensuring that America is doing its part to reduce global warming  and join in the global effort that is needed to address this world wide environmental issue    I want to mention the efforts of states like California  which has already enacted legislation requiring mandatory reduction of greenhouse gas emissions  and the Northeast states of Connecticut  Delaware  Maine  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  and Vermont  which are also seeking to limit emissions from power plants  Over 300 U S  mayors have signed an agreement to reduce emissions in their cities     As these state plans and legislation are implemented  they will offer Congress and the Administration unique opportunities to review and incorporate lessons learned from these efforts into federal legislation  Despite the improvements we have made in this version of our bill to be environmentally responsible and to minimize economic costs  we will continue to pursue new and innovative ideas that will further these objectives  and we will modify our bill accordingly     The legislation we submit today is designed to protect our environment from the impacts of the climate change resulting from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  improve our national security by reducing reliance on fossil fuels that often carry with them geopolitical costs  and position our economy to become a world leader in the expanding markets for development and deployment of new energy efficient technologies and renewable energy sources  It proposes the utilization of the    cap and trade    approach and promotes the commercialization of technologies that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions  mitigate the impacts of climate change  and increase the nation   s energy independence  And it will help to keep America at the cutting edge of innovation where the jobs and trade opportunities of the new economy are to be found  It will also serve to protect our country and the world from the security threat posed by populations whose health  livelihood  and variability are potentially threatened by global rising temperatures and altered environments    In fact  the cap and trade provisions and the technology title are complementary parts of a comprehensive program that will allow us to usher in a new energy era  an era of responsible and innovative energy production and use that will yield enormous environmental  economic  and diplomatic benefits  The cap and trade portion provides the economic driver for existing and new technologies capable of supplying reliable and clean energy and making the best use of America s available energy resources  Because of the multiple benefits promised by this comprehensive program  we expect that the new bill will attract additional support for the vital purposes of the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act  We simply need the political will to match the public s concern about climate change  desire for national security  the economic interests of business and consumers  and American technological ingenuity and expertise    As I mentioned  we continue to learn more about the science of climate change and the dangerous precedence of not addressing this environmental problem  The science tells us that urgent and significant action is needed  Our National Academies of Sciences  along with the national academies from the other G8 nations  China  India  and Brazil  has said in a joint statement that    there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring    and A t  he scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action       We recognize that many fear the costs of taking action  But there are costs to delay as well  Failure to implement significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions in the near term will yield only more climate change and a much harder job in the future  Our comprehensive legislation is one approach to a productive  secure  and clean energy future  But it is only one approach and we welcome other proposals B let a thousand flowers bloom     Mr  President  significant reductions in greenhouse gases   well beyond those required by this bill   are feasible over the next 15 20 years using technologies available today  Also  the most important technological deployment opportunities to reduce emissions over the next two decades lie with energy efficient technologies and renewable energy sources  including nuclear  solar  wind  and bio fuels  For example  in the electric power sector  which accounts for one third of U S  emissions  major pollution reductions can be achieved by improving the efficiency of existing fossil fuel plants  adding new reactor designs for nuclear power  expanding use of renewable power sources  and significantly reducing electricity demand with the use of energy saving technologies currently available to residential and commercial consumers  These clean technologies need to be promoted and that is what spurs our action today    Let me take a moment to address a section of our legislation that has been the target of some concerns by environmentalists and others  concerns that I believe are entirely unwarranted  The provisions in our bill to promote nuclear energy are an importantpart of the comprehensive technology package    I know that some of our friends here in the Senate and in the environmental community maintain strong objections to nuclear energy  even though today it supplies nearly 20 percent of the electricity generated in the U S  and much higher proportions in places such as France  Belgium  Sweden and Switzerland B countries that are not exactly known for their environmental disregard  The fact is  nuclear energy is CLEAN  It produces ZERO emissions  while the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity produces approximately 33 percent of the greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere  and is a major contributor to air pollution affecting our communities    The idea that nuclear power should play no role in our future energy mix is an unsustainable position  particularly given the urgency and magnitude of the threat posed by global warming which most regard as the greatest environmental threat to the planet     Mr  President  the International Energy Agency estimates that the world s energy consumption is expected to rise over 65  within the next fifteen years  If the demand for electricity is met using traditional coal fired power plants  not only will we fail to reduce carbon emissions as necessary  but the level of carbon in the atmosphere will skyrocket and intensify the greenhouse effect and the global warming it produces     As nuclear plants are decommissioned  the percentage of U S  electricity produced by this zero emission technology will actually decline  Therefore  at a minimum  we must make efforts to maintain nuclear energy   s level of contribution  so that this capacity is not replaced with higher emitting alternatives     Mr  President  no doubt  some people will object to the idea of the federal government playing any role in helping demonstrate and commercialize new and beneficial energy technologies  and particularly nuclear designs  We understand the power of markets to spur innovation and our proposals are built on this fundamental lesson  But the fact remains that the market playing field has been highly uneven B fossil fuels have been subsidized for many decades at levels that can scarcely be calculated  The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil fueled technologies  Yet  it   s a cost that we all bear  too often in terms of ill health and diminished quality of life  That is simply a matter of fact     It is also inescapable that the ability to avoid internalizing these costs placed produces at a great advantage over clean competitors  Based on that fact  and in light of the enormous environmental and economic risk posed by global warming  I believe that providing zero and low emission technologies such as nuclear a boost into the market place so that these clean technologies can be utilized as soon as possible is responsible public policy  and a matter of simple public necessity  particularly  as we work to promote America   s energy independence     The Navy has operated nuclear powered submarines for more than 50 years and has an impressive safety and performance record  The Naval Reactors program has demonstrated that nuclear power can be done safely  One of the underpinning of its safety record is the approach used in its reactor designs  which is to learn and built upon previous designs  Unfortunately for the commercial nuclear industry  they have not had the opportunity to use such an approach since the industry has not been able to build a reactor in over the past 25 years  This lapse in construction has led us to where we are today with the industry   s aging infrastructure  As we have learned from other industries  this in itself represents a great risk to public safety    As Senator Lieberman and I have continued working for passage of legislation to address climate change in a meaningful way  it has become clear to us that any responsible climate change measure must contain five essential components    First  it must have rational  mandatory emission reduction targets and timetables  It must be goal oriented  and have both environmental and economic integrity  We need policy that will produce necessary outcomes  not merely check political boxes  The goal must be feasible and based on sound science  and this is what we have tried to do in this bill     Second  it must utilize a market based cap and trade system  It must limit greenhouse gas emissions and allows the trading of emission credits to drive enterprise  innovation and efficiency  This is the central component of our legislation  Voluntary efforts will not change the status quo  taxes are counterproductive  and markets are more dependable than regulators in effecting sustainable change     Third  it must include mechanisms to minimize costs and work effectively with other markets  The    trade    part of    cap and trade    is such a mechanism  but it   s clear it must be bolstered by other assurances that costs will be minimized  I am as concerned as anyone about the economic impacts associated with any climate change legislation  I know that many economists are developing increasingly sophisticated ways to project future costs of compliance  Lately  we have seen the increased interest in this area of research  As we learn more from these models about additional action items to further reduce costs  we intend to incorporate them  Already  based upon earlier economic analysis  we have added    offsets    provisions in this bill in an effort to minimize costs and to provide for the creation of new markets  And  I assure my colleagues  we will continue to seek new and innovative ways to further minimize costs    Fourth  it must spur the development and deployment of advanced technology  Nuclear  solar  and other alternative energy must be part of the equation and we need a dedicated national commitment to develop and bring to market the technologies of the future as a matter of good environmental and economic policy  There will be a growing global market for these technologies and the U S  will benefit greatly from being competitive and capturing its share of these markets  This legislation includes a detailed technology title that would go a long way toward meeting this goal  Unlike the Energy bill  it would be funded using the proceeds from the auctioning of allowable emission credits  rather than from the use of taxpayers  funds or appropriations that will never materialize     And fifth  it must facilitate international efforts to solve the problem  Global warming is an international problem requiring an international effort  The United States has an obligation to lead  Our leadership cannot replace the need for action by countries such as India and China  We must spur and facilitate it  We have added provisions that would allow U S  companies to enter into partnerships in developing countries for the purpose of conducting projects to achieve certified emission reductions  which may be traded on the international market     These five components represent a serious challenge that will require a great deal of effort  the concentration of substantial intellectual power  and the continued efforts of our colleagues and those in the environmental  industry  economic  and national security communities  We look forward to collaborating in this effort as we continue to shape our legislation to its most effective form    Mr  President  the status quo is a strong and stubborn force  People and institutions are averse to change  even when that change is critical for their own well being  and that of their children and grandchildren  If the scientists are right and temperatures continue to rise  we could face environmental  economic  and national security consequences far beyond our ability to imagine  If they are wrong and the Earth finds a way to compensate for the unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  what will we have accomplished  Cleaner air  greater energy efficiency  a more diverse and secure energy mix  and U S  leadership in the technologies of the future  There is no doubt  failure to act is the far greater risk     I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor                                                      January 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
