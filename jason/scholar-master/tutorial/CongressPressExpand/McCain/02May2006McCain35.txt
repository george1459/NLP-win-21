                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON CROP  LIVESTOCK AND DAIRY PROVISIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL May 3  2006 Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  spoke before the United States Senate and submitted for the record the following statement on his amendment  to strike  74 5 million for grants to States based on their production of certain types of crops  livestock and dairy products  to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill   Mr  President  I call up Amendment  3616  and ask for its immediate consideration  This amendment would strike  74 5 million for grants to States based on their production of certain types of crops  livestock and dairy products  which was not included in the Administration s emergency supplemental request   Mr  President  it has been a longstanding policy in the United State Senate to prohibit the practice of adding authorizing language to an appropriations bill  Nevertheless  this bill includes a massive  3 94 billion Agriculture Assistance program  None of the funding under this agriculture title was included in the Administration s supplemental request  Interestingly  this nearly  4 billion add on  Title III of the underlying bill  received only a one paragraph mention in the entire Committee Report accompanying the bill  One paragraph to describe 31 pages of legislative language with a  4 billion price tag  Let me read it for the benefit of my colleagues who have not had the opportunity to review the report   TITLE III  EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE  The Committee recommends  3 944 000 000 for emergency agricultural disaster assistance  These funds will help farmers and ranchers in States affected by recent hurricanes  drought  flood  wildfire  and other natural disasters recover from resulting production losses  These funds will also assist in the removal of debris from watersheds in order to minimize the threat of flooding from future storm events  In addition  the funds will provide economic assistance to producers to compensate for high energy costs relating to agricultural production   Mr  President  I m all for helping to the extent appropriate farmers and other victims battered by hurricanes  But the agricultural assistance added in this bill is far more expansive than merely offering help to areas hit by the 2005 hurricanes and at least the limited report language doesn t hide that fact   As my colleagues know  the USDA currently has a range of disaster assistance programs including crop insurance programs that are already available  Yet this bill is going to add nearly  4 billion on top of the existing programs  In my view  the agriculture assistance funding is being used more as a vehicle to fill a voter wish list than it is meet the urgent needs of the victims of the 2005 hurricane season  Taxpayer dollars are being allocated for agriculture subsidies and bail outs which  in some cases  have nothing to do with hurricane recovery   Mr  President  my amendment would strike an earmark that provides  74 5 million in agriculture assistance for grants to States based on their production of specialty of crops  livestock and dairy products Why is this necessary  Have the hurricanes wiped out the specialty crop industry  What even is a specialty crop and why does it need  74 5 million of taxpayer funding  I hope that a specialty crop is a money tree because that is what is going to be needed to pay for this bill   My colleagues may be interested to know that the bill defines speciality crops as anything but wheat  feed grains  oilseeds  cotton  rice  or peanuts  Anything but  Why do we exclude those commodities from receiving this funding  Is sugarcane made ineligible   Are my colleagues aware that the USDA already has a Specialty Crop Block Grant Program that was authorized in 2004  Under the existing program  speciality crops are defined as fruits  vegetables  treenuts  dried fruits  and nursery crops  including floriculture  The program is funded at  7 million for the current fiscal year and it provides  100 000 grants to each State that applies  Is there a problem with that program that I am not aware of that gives just cause to providing it with an emergency supplemental appropriation to the tune of more one thousand percent above its annual appropriation   Mr  President  this bill provides  74 5 million that is to be used to award grants based on the share of each State s total value of specialty crop  livestock  and dairy production of the United states for the 2004 crop year multiplied by  74 5 million  That means the more you ve produced   if your crops have not been hit by a natural disaster or flooding or drought   the more money you get  That is the polar opposite of what the USDA disaster assistance programs are about  And doesn t that fly in the face of what an emergency supplemental is for  An emergency supplemental is supposed to be about addressing needs and not about providing rewards for productivity  And more importantly  why is what obviously is designed to be a nationwide agriculture funding assistance program   a program not requested by the Administration and singled out in the Statement of Administration Policy as objectionable   being included in a must pass emergency spending bill that is supposed to address the Global War on Terror and Hurricane recovery   My colleagues may be interested to know that under this legislation  States can use the grant to promote the purchase  sale or consumption of agricultural products  Hmm  Last week I mentioned that federal dollars had been used to paint salmon on airplanes  Maybe that  74 5 million will be used to paint vegetables on airplanes  Or maybe a pretty flower  Or maybe a nice acorn  How about some dried apricots or prunes  That would be sure to increase consumption   Upon closer reading of the legislative language  I notice that the appropriators actually have created a  100 million program for specialty crops  In addition to the  74 5 million  it provides for  25 5 million to make grants to the several States  the District of Columbia  and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to be used to support activities that promote agriculture  Again  I envision painted murals of specialty crops  not that anyone would know that when they are looking at a carrot  they are witness to a specialty crop   I hope the sponsors of this legislation will correct me if I m wrong  and I m confident that they will  but it appears that with respect to the  25 5 million funding  the bill provides that all 50 states will each receive  500 000 of that money  while Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia each will receive  250 000  Mr  President  what specialty crops are grown in DC   What kind of campaign should we expect from the District of Columbia as it uses these funds to support activities that promote agriculture  Will they paint vegetables on the metro trains   This funding is not needed  Mr  President   It should be noted that according to OMB In 2005  many crops had record or near record production  and U S  farm sector cash receipts were the second highest ever  Can a unrequested  74 4 million grant program truly be sold as an urgent  emergency spending need at this time   Mr  President  I know my colleagues have the highest hopes for the success and safety of our troops  and for the speedy recovery of the hurricane ravaged Gulf  But when the American people hear of these special interest riders  they re going to question our priorities   and rightly so   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment                                             May
