                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM July 26  2005 Washington  D C    Today  Senator McCain delivered the following statement before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary   Mr  Chairman  I would like to commend you for holding today s hearing to address one of the most important challenges facing our country  immigration reform  I believe this is the first Full Committee hearing by the Judiciary Committee in several years  and I commend you for recognizing the need to address this difficult issue today  It is a timely and important hearing and the reason is obvious  our immigration system is broken  Made up of laws that are unrealistic and often unenforceable  reforming it is one of the most critical issues facing America today   Illegal immigration  in the numbers we are witnessing today  represents a threat to our national security  to our economy  to our health care system  and to state and local government budgets  It also poses a humanitarian crisis that anyone with basic human compassion must seek to address  These are the reasons why  Mr  Chairman  if you walk down the streets of my home state of Arizona and ask people what issue most concerns them today they won t say Social Security  or the economy  or even the war on terror  They ll say it s immigration   Let me mention just a few statistics   Last year more than 300 people died trying to cross our southern border  and more than 200 of those deaths occurred in Arizona s desert  This year those numbers are expected to increase   An estimated 3 000 people enter the U S  illegally from Mexico every day   Last year 1 1 million illegal immigrants were caught by Border Patrol  and more than half of those were in Arizona   The stories of tragedy along the border add a compelling human component to this issue   Several weeks ago  79 people were found in a Phoenix alley crammed into a commercial horse trailer  The heat was over 100 degrees and they had been there for several days  Of the 79  11 were children  including a 4 month old baby   At the beginning of the summer  when the temperature in the desert rose unexpectedly  twelve people died crossing into Arizona in one weekend   I could go on  Mr  Chairman  but let me move on to what I believe we need to do to fix this badly broken system  Senator Kennedy and I  along with Senators Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  and Salazar  and Congressmen Kolbe  Flake  and Gutierrez  introduced S  1033  the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act on May 12th  This bill is bipartisan  it is bicameral  and it will fix our immigration problems by coupling badly needed revisions to our obsolete immigration laws with tough enforcement at the border and at the workplace   Enforcement is so key to what we are trying to accomplish with this bill  that we lead with enforcement  The first two titles of our bill deal solely with border security enforcement efforts  And in addition to proposing strong enforcement at the borders  we also propose very strong internal enforcement  including biometric identification for all temporary foreign workers  electronic employment verification of all workers  and tough penalties for law breakers  including employers   Recognizing that the United States cannot solve this problem alone  the international border security portion of our bill offers a framework for the U S  to work with Mexico  Canada  and Central American countries to improve security at our borders and to crack down on human smuggling  drug trafficking  and gang activities in order to strengthen the security of our hemisphere  It also directs the Administration to work with Mexico and other sending countries to enter into agreements designed to reduce illegal migration and establish economic incentives for temporary workers to return home   Another problem with our current system is that employers have plausible deniability when it comes to hiring illegal immigrants  A wink and a nod is all it takes  Recognizing this  our bill requires the development and implementation of a mandatory employment verification system using tamper resistant  biometric  machine readable identification  Employers will have concrete confirmation that the individual they hire is authorized to work   or is not  What they will no longer have is an excuse to break the law   Our bill also doubles the fines that employers face when they employ undocumented immigrants  and it provides protections for whistleblowers who notify authorities when employers or workers are breaking the law  And our bill provides the Department of Labor with strong authorities to go after businesses and recruiters who break the rules   But  Mr  Chairman  our bill does not just authorize tough new enforcement procedures  It also provides funding to back it up  With the fees and fines that will be collected under this bill  we expect that billions of dollars will fund new immigration enforcement and border security activities at the Department of Homeland Security  the Department of Labor  and the Social Security Administration   Enforcement alone  however  will not solve the problems that plague the current system  One of the key failures of the current system  and of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act  is the inadequate limits on legal immigration  Millions of people are working illegally in our country largely because there aren t viable channels for them to enter legally  Our bill addresses this problem by creating a flexible  market based temporary worker program that  pairs willing workers with willing employers   This program is structured to meet the economy s need for workers  while providing protections to both U S  and foreign workers   There remains  however  a key issue that must be addressed   the current undocumented  Today there are an estimated 11 million people living illegally in our country  one analysis by Bear Stearns argues that the number could be as high as 20 million  Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum  the fact that 11 million or more people are living and working in this country without proper documentation should be a concern to all  The question is  what are we going to do about it   We need is a comprehensive solution  One that recognizes the need to separate the illegal immigrants working hard for a better life from those who are in our country who want to do us harm   The reality is  11 million people are not going to voluntarily come out of the shadows just to be shipped home   Report to Deport  is not reality and it isn t workable  Systematically rounding up every person living here illegally and sending them home isn t a viable solution either  It is neither practically possible or economically feasible  In fact  a recent study estimated that a mass deportation of the current undocumented would cost the federal government between  206 billion to  230 billion dollars and that estimate assumes that several million will come forward voluntarily   Let me also make a few comments about amnesty  We are not proposing an amnesty bill  We tried amnesty in this country in 1986  and it didn t work then and it won t work in 2005  either  We can t reward lawbreakers  but we also have to deal with the reality of our enormous undocumented population   We have a national interest in identifying these individuals  providing them with incentives to come out of the shadows  go through security background checks  pay back taxes  pay penalties for breaking the law  learn to speak English  and regularize their status  This can be accomplished in a manner that fosters the social  economic  and security interest of the United States   I recognize that several of my colleagues present here today have proposed legislation that address various aspects of our broken immigration system  Although we may approach this problem with competing philosophies and with different proposed solutions  our mutual recognition of the failures of the current system moves the debate forward   We will never be able to please the political extremists on either side of this issue  However  in the interest of country as a whole  we must pursue a carefully balanced solution  I hope we can work together to put rhetoric aside and enact meaningful comprehensive immigration reform this year   Thank you  Mr  Chairman  I look forward to working with you and the Committee to address this critical issue                                                  July 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
