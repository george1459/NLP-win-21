                                                                                                                         MCCAIN INTRODUCES SAFTEY TO INDIAN WOMEN ACT May 10  2005 U S  Senator John McCain  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs  today introduced The Restoring Safety to Indian Women Act the following is his statement submitted for the Congressional Record   Mr  President  today I am introducing  The Restoring Safety to Indian Women Act  and I look forward to working with the Committee on the Judiciary to ensure that the provisions of this bill are given consideration  particularly as the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act moves forward  I also wish to thank Senator Byron Dorgan for co sponsoring this legislation and for his dedication to addressing the health and welfare needs of Indian tribes   This legislation creates a new federal criminal offense authorizing federal prosecutors to charge repeat domestic violence offenders before they seriously injure or kill someone and to use tribal court convictions for domestic violence for that purpose  It authorizes the creation of tribal criminal history databases to document these convictions and protection orders for use by all law enforcement  The bill authorizes BIA and tribal officers to make arrests for domestic violence assaults committed outside of their presence and would authorizes a comprehensive study of domestic violence in Indian Country to determine its impact to Indian tribes   The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has had a tremendous impact on raising the national awareness of domestic violence and providing communities  including Indian tribes  the resources to respond to the devastating impact of domestic violence  National studies show that one in four women are victims of domestic violence  Since 1999  the Department of Justice has issued various studies which report that Indian women experience the highest rates of domestic violence compared to all other groups in the United States  These reports state that one out of every three Indian women are victims of sexual assault  that from 1979 to 1992  homicide was the third leading cause of death of Indian females between the ages of 15 to 34 and that 75  of those deaths were committed by a family member or acquaintance  These are startling statistics that require our close examination and a better understanding of how to prevent and respond to domestic violence in Indian Country   Domestic violence is a national problem and not one that is unique to Indian Country  Yet  due to the unique status of Indian tribes  there are obstacles faced by Indian tribal police  federal investigators  tribal and federal prosecutors and courts that impede their ability to respond to domestic violence in Indian Country  This bill is intended to remove these obstacles at all levels and to enhance the ability of each agency to respond to acts of domestic violence when they occur   The division of criminal jurisdiction between federal and tribal law enforcement and prosecutors working in Indian Country present challenges  For example  federal prosecutors prosecute acts of domestic violence in Indian Country using the Assault or  unfortunately  the Murder statutes in the Major Crimes Act  These statutes require the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was disfigured  suffered a serious risk of death or was killed before these felony charges can be filed  Meanwhile  the research has shown that perpetrators of domestic violence become increasingly more violent over time  Under the existing statutory scheme  these perpetrators may escape felony charges until they seriously injure or kill someone   This bill would create a new federal offense aimed at the habitual domestic violence offender and allow tribal court convictions to count for purposes of federal felony prosecution when the perpetrator has at least two separate federal  state or tribal convictions for crimes involving assault  sexual abuse or a violent felony against a spouse or intimate partner  This provision is similar to many state laws that apply a felony penalty to an individual who commits multiple offenses  It will empower Indian tribal prosecutors and courts to document domestic violence cases at the local level and give federal prosecutors the ability to intervene in the cycle of violence by charging repeat offenders before they seriously injure or kill someone   The bill would also encourage the use of existing grants authorized by the Violence Against Women Act to create tribal criminal history databases for use by Indian tribes and tribal  state and federal law enforcement agencies to document final convictions  stay away orders and orders of protection issued by tribal courts  As I understand it  no such database exists today  This database would be used solely as a law enforcement and court tracking tool  It would enable tribal  state and federal law enforcement officers to determine whether an individual is a habitual domestic violence offender and therefore subject to the felony crime described above  It also would enhance the implementation of the criminal provisions that already exist in the Violence Against Women Act   All manner of law enforcement agencies report that responding to domestic violence disturbances are among the most dangerous situations that a police officer faces  Therefore  many states have enacted immediate arrest or removal policies that enable responding officers to diffuse these dangerous situations  Currently  the primary law enforcement authority for Indian tribes  the BIA police  are only authorized to make an arrest without a warrant for an offense committed in Indian Country if the offense is committed in the presence of the officer or the offense is a felony  This legislation would expand the authority of the BIA police  and tribal police agencies that derive their arrest authority by contract with the BIA  to make an arrest without a warrant for a domestic violence offense when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person arrested committed the offense  This arrest authority will enable a responding officer to diffuse the dangerous situation by arresting the perpetrator  This will go a long way toward improving public safety for both the officer and the domestic violence victim   Finally  while the national data on the rates of violence affecting Indian women are astounding  we do not know the full extent to which Indian women residing in Indian Country are impacted by domestic violence or the impact of domestic violence on Indian tribes  For example  we know that nationally  domestic violence costs  4 1 billion each year for direct medical and mental health services and in my own state of Arizona  last year  police received approximately 100 000 domestic violence calls  but we do not know the extent to which tribal prevention programs  law enforcement  court or medical intervention resources are similarly impacted  Therefore  this bill would require that a comprehensive study be done on the scope of the domestic violence problem in Indian Country   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Indian Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee to ensure that these statistics become a record of the past  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and the full text of the bill be printed in the record
