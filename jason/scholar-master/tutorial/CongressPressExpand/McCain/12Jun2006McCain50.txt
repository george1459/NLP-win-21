                                                                                                                         MCCAIN AMENDMENT REQUIRES REGULAR BUDGETING FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN June 14  2006 Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on the floor of the U S  Senate regarding the introduction of the McCain amendment  which requires regular budgeting for ongoing military operations   Mr  President  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration   This amendment would require regular budgeting for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Warner  Levin  Graham  Byrd  Gregg  Hagel  Chambliss  Collins  Coburn  Conrad  and Reid   Mr  President  the War on Terror has now been going on for nearly 5 years  since that tragic day in September 2001  Yet since that time  the Administration has sought to fund the war operations almost entirely through emergency supplemental appropriations measures  instead of through its annual budget submissions  The most recent supplemental measure  which the Senate  is expected to pass Thursday morning   is the 9th supplemental bill since September 2001  With its enactment  we will have provided over  420 billion to pay for ongoing military operations  reconstruction  and training of Iraqi security forces  defense spending that I fully support  And all of that money is designated as emergency expenditures   provided without any offsetting revenues  as if it were free money  But it isn t   I think we can fund this war  and indeed win this war  while also budgeting for this war  We know the war is going to cost more than the  420 billion to date  And we know that the war is not going to end as quickly as most of us would prefer  But we need to continue our military operations until the job is done  Withdrawing our military presence prematurely is not an option in my view  the view of many of my colleagues  nor the view of the President or his advisors  We are in it to win   Unfortunately  the Administration s unwillingness to budget for the war through the regular budget process means that neither the White House nor Congress is making the tough decisions about how we are going to pay for the ongoing wars  If we continue down this same path  that job will be left to future generations  because the expenditures are being made regardless  and eventually  their impact on our budget will have to be addressed  The longer we wait to make the tough decisions  the bigger the problem will become  and the more difficult making those tough decisions will be   Our nation s future economic success rests in part on the decisions we make today  and the ones we put off  We are facing some dire fiscal challenges in the days ahead  According to the Government Accountability Office  GAO   the unfunded federal financial burden  such as public debt  future Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid payments  totals more than  46 trillion  or  156 000 per man  woman and child  According to David Walker  the head of the GAO  for a family  this burden is like having a  750 000 mortgage   and no house  But  instead of fixing the problem  and fixing it will not be easy  we ve only succeeded in making it bigger  more unstable  more complicated  and much  much more expensive  And adding hundreds of billions of dollars that are more conveniently designated as emergency expenditures  so that they don t have to be budgeted for along with other national priorities  is only making our fiscal problems that much greater   Somehow  the concept of true emergency funding bills has gotten lost along the way  Take the most recent supplemental appropriations bill  The President requested a total of  94 5 billion to fund our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as additional funding to aid in the recovery efforts along the hurricane affected Gulf Coast and other urgent needs  I believe the war funding is the largest amount yet proposed in what is now almost a routine series of supplemental requests to fund this ongoing war  The Senate passed bill provided  108 9 billion in spending   14 4 billion above the level that the President has indicated he is willing to sign into law  Despite the efforts of several of us to trim that bill of unrequested earmarks and questionable spending  the Senate didn t have the will to do so prior to the bill s passage  It wasn t until conference  with the looming threat of a sustainable veto  that the bill was trimmed  But the fact remains that the funding provided for in that bill is enormous and it would be more fiscally responsible to be dealt with in the annual authorization and appropriations process   Of course  that supplemental is only the most recent example of why this amendment is necessary  Since 2001  the Administration and Congress has routinely funded our ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through emergency supplemental appropriation bills  In addition  many defense related activities that should have been financed through the normal appropriations process have been funded through these emergency supplementals  And in the process  more and more non defense related spending has also been creeping into these bills  greatly undermining the budget process   There are several criticisms of the supplemental appropriations process that  I hope the Senate will agree  are egregious enough to lend overwhelming support for the adoption of this amendment   First  unless we take action  emergency funds will continue to be employed as a way to add spending above that contained under the budget caps  It has become all too routine for the Administration to omit what should be normal spending items for the budget it sends to Congress in February  Instead  the Administration relies on supplementals to fund critical must pass items  such as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as more routine defense spending  Congress then approves these requests and regularly tries to augment them with non emergency  non defense items   Second  supplemental appropriations have diminished responsible budget decisions and proper oversight by Congress  Put aside for a moment that authorizing committees are not consulted with regards to supplemental appropriations in the same manner that occurs during the normal annual budget process  Emergency supplemental appropriation requests are not forwarded to Congress with the same level of budget justification and details that are routinely sent to Congress when the President s annual budget is forwarded in February each year  If the authorizing and appropriation committees are not allowed to scrutinize fully the effectiveness of defense programs and are unwilling to end programs that are not effective  we will continue to have an ineffectual budget   Third  budgeting annually through emergency supplemental appropriation bills encourages pork barrel spending  I think the two week debate on the most recent supplemental is fresh in everyone s mind so I will not mention the many provisions that objections were raised against  But the fact is  unrequested add ons which ultimately make it into final supplemental appropriation conference reports are almost never the subject of a hearing in the authorization and appropriation committees  They are seldom  if ever  subjected to a recorded vote in a committee or on the floor of the House or Senate  These items very often are not even included in legislation initially passed by the House or Senate  but are instead added by a conference committee   Mr  President  we have not always funded our war efforts through routine supplemental appropriations measures  It is worth examining history to perceive how the practice has been exploited beyond all reasonable defense   For the Korean War  which lasted 3 years  there was only one supplemental appropriations bill   During the 11 year Vietnam War  there were 4 supplemental appropriation bills  As soon as troop levels in Southeast Asia stopped climbing  the Johnson and Nixon Administrations requested funding for ongoing operations in the regular defense authorization and appropriation bills   Since 9 11  there have been 9 supplemental appropriation bills in 5 years to fund the ongoing War on Terror  including 2 in each of the years of 2002  2004  and 2005  Over 90 percent of the funding for Iraq and Afghanistan ongoing operations has been funded through 1 to 2 emergency supplemental appropriation bills each year for the past 5 years  It now totals over  420 billion in emergency supplemental funding  Mr  President  despite the fact that during this same period of time  Congress provided over   2 2 trillion for defense related expenditures in the regular annual defense spending bills   Mr  President  this amendment is about fiscal responsibility  Most of us have voted in recent years to support several Sense of the Senate amendments stating that the war should be budgeted for in the regular process  In fact  just this past April 27  the Senate voted 94 to 0 to approve such an amendment  I fully supported that proposition each time it has been offered  Now  this amendment before us would put real meaning into the positions we previously voted to support   Let me also be clear about what this amendment does not do  It does not seek to prevent any future emergency funding requests for war operations  But it does require budgeting for the ongoing expenses we know are going to occur  If next year  after the budget is submitted in February  a totally unforeseen expenditure arises that must be urgently addressed  the Administration would have the ability to submit a supplemental request  But simple costs of doing business expenditures   costs that can be estimated and budgeted for  but are more conveniently funded without any offsets  would not be allowed   In the weeks ahead  as we contemplate and discuss ways to improve the budget process  control spending and reduce the deficit  I hope that this simple amendment on budgeting for ongoing military operations would serve as a bi partisan effort that can help to start us on the critical path to gaining control of spending   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment                                                     June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
