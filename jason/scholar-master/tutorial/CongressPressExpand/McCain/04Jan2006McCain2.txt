COURT January 5  2006 Washington D C   Today United States Senator John McCain spoke on the floor of the United States Senate and submitted the following statement for the record   Mr  President  as we all know  elections have consequences  When President Bush ran for reelection  he stated plainly and often that  if given the opportunity  he would nominate conservative judges to the Supreme Court  True to his promise  the President nominated John Roberts to become the 18th Chief Justice of the United States  Just as true  he nominated Samuel Alito to serve as an Associate Justice of the Court   I was pleased that the President nominated Judge Alito  as were many other members of this body  Though very favorably disposed  I reserved final judgment on his nomination out of respect for both the confirmation process and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  I do not take the Senate s advice and consent role lightly  and I did not want to encourage a rush to judgment without the benefit of public hearings   Those hearings have occurred  and since then I have announced that I will vote to confirm Judge Alito  Through 18 hours and over 700 questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee  the judge demonstrated that he will be an intelligent  fair  and open minded Justice who respects the judiciary s important but limited role of interpreting the law  I believe that he is worthy of not only my own support  but that of other members of this body  And  certainly  this nominee deserves an up or down vote   Judge Alito has earned the highest rating of the American Bar Association  As stated by Stephen Tober  the chairman of the ABA s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary  to merit an evaluation of well qualified  the ABA s highest rating  the nominee must possess professional qualifications and achievements of the highest standing  Mr  Tober went on to testify  We are ultimately persuaded that Judge Alito has  throughout his 15 years on the Federal bench  established a record of both proper judicial conduct and even handed application in seeking to do what is fundamentally fair       His integrity  his professional competence  and his judicial temperament are  indeed  found to be of the highest standard  Of the highest standard  Mr  President   The ABA s conclusions are based in part on interviews of 300 individuals throughout our Nation  130 Federal judges  many State judges  and many colleagues  co counsel  and opposing counsel  According to the ABA s testimony  these individuals almost uniformly talked in terms of his evenhandedness  of his open mindedness  of his willingness to be fair  He s called a judge s judge more than once in those interviews  A former clerk of Judge Alito  Professor Nora Demleitner  testified before the Judiciary Committee that the judge is a man of great integrity  decency  and character  And I say this as a left leaning Democrat  a member of the ACLU  a woman  and an immigrant  I am not alone in this view of Judge Alito  I know many others who have clerked for and worked with Judge Alito  and everyone has only positive words about him  Each and every one of us has unfailing respect and regard for him  his character  his wit and his humanity  All of his clerks  many of whom are politically liberal  have signed on to a letter strongly urging the Senate to confirm Judge Alito as Associate Justice  Professor Demleitner later explained that the judge earned such support and respect because Judge Alito has always tried to follow the law and decided cases on their individual merits  And there are plenty of other examples of strong support for Judge Alito from people of all political stripes  Listen to what former 3rd Circuit Judge Tim Lewis said in testimony before the Judiciary Committee   It is no coincidence to anyone who is familiar with my body of work while I served on the United States Court of Appeals and my body of work since having left the court that I happen to be sitting on the far left of this panel here this afternoon       I am openly and unapologetically pro choice and always have been      I am very  very much involved in a number of endeavors that one who is familiar with Judge Alito s background and experience may wonder  well  why are you here today saying positive things about his prospects as a Justice on the Supreme Court         I n the end I am here as a matter of principle and as a matter of my own commitment to justice  to fairness  and my sense that Sam Alito is uniformly qualified in all important respects to serve as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court   Mr  President  Judge Lewis has it exactly right  different does not mean unqualified  and if we are going to be respectful of the advice and consent role that we are playing here we must set aside partisanship and focus on the nominee s qualifications and integrity  which in the case of Judge Alito are above reproach  Many of us did just that when we voted in favor of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer  No one can argue with a straight face that the facts before lead to any other reasonable conclusion   The statements of support that I have read show that the debate over Judge Alito may be partisan in the Senate and among some interest groups  but those who know him best support Judge Alito regardless of where they are on the political spectrum  whether they are liberal or conservative  Democrat or Republican  This strong bipartisan support for Judge Alito based on his professional qualifications and judgment leads me to suggest that the Senate should vote as soon as possible to make this judge a Justice of the Supreme Court  As the president said earlier this week  There has been no sign of any extraordinary circumstance except for this extraordinary thing  he s extraordinarily capable to serve on the Supreme Court  I could not agree more   Mr  President  Judge Alito is a man of outstanding qualifications whose record as a thoughtful conservative has won my vote  Without any reasonable doubt  it has also earned the support of this body                                                     January 2006 Press Releases
