                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON THE IRAQ FUNDING AMENDMENT  The Armed Forces and the American People deserve better December 18  2007      U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following statement on the floor of the U S  Senate regarding the Iraq Funding Amendment to H R  2764  the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008     Mr  President  I strongly support the amendment offered by the Republican leader that would deliver vital funding for our troops in Iraq     The underlying House passed bill is not only irresponsive to the facts on the ground in Iraq  it is simply irresponsible  It fails to provide any funding for our troops fighting in Iraq and actually contains an explicit prohibition against the use of funds for Operation Iraqi Freedom  The authors have compiled a bill of some 1400 pages and an even larger joint explanatory statement chock full of unnecessary spending  but they include not a dime for our troops in Iraq     Consider  Mr  President  that the bill on the floor today contains  1 6 million for animal vaccines in Greenport  New York  but not a penny for our soldiers in Iraq   477 000 for Barley Health Food Benefits  but nothing for the troops in Iraq   846 000 for the Fathers Day Rally Committee of Philadelphia  but not a dime for our sons and daughters who are fighting  We are willing to appropriate  244 000 for bee research in Weslaco  Texas  but not a dollar for our fighting men and women in Baghdad  Kirkuk  and Anbar  It is a sad day indeed when  in the middle of a war this country must win  the Congress provides more funds for bee research than for the brave Americans risking their lives on our behalf     For Congress to fail to provide the funds needed by our soldiers in the field is inexcusable under any circumstances  but it is especially disappointing right now  at the very moment when General David Petraeus and his troops are achieving the kind of progress in Iraq that many dismissed as impossible just a few months ago     The bills proponents seek  I suppose  a precipitous withdrawal of U S  combat forces from Iraq  regardless of conditions on the ground or the views of our commanders in the field  If that sounds familiar  it should  the majority has thus far engaged in no less than 40 legislative attempts to achieve this misguided outcome  The choice today is simple  do we build upon the clear successes of our current strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his command the support they require to complete their mission  or do we ignore the realities and legislate a premature end to our efforts in Iraq  accepting thereby all the terrible consequences that will ensue  The answer  Mr  President  should be also simple     I had the privilege of spending Thanksgiving with our troops in Iraq and  on this trip  I saw and heard firsthand about the remarkable transformation that these brave men and women in uniform have brought about this year  After nearly four years of mismanaged war  our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  has made significant gains under the new American counterinsurgency strategy  the so called surge     Overall violence in Iraq has fallen to its lowest levels since the first year of the invasion  Lt  Gen  Ray Odierno  the second in command in Iraq  said this week that this improvement is due to the increase in American troops and better trained Iraqi forces  Improvised explosive device  IED  blasts  the foremost source of U S  combat deaths  now occur at a rate lower than any point since September 2004  Just this week  Maj  Gen  Joseph Fil  the commander for Baghdad  stated that attacks in Baghdad have fallen nearly 80 percent since November 2006  murders in Baghdad province are down by some 90 percent over the same period  and vehicle borne bombs have dropped by 70 percent  Maj  Gen  Fil  added that  today  there is no longer any part of Baghdad under al Qaeda control  though the terrorist group is still still lurking in the shadows     Last week  the violence in Anbar province was the lowest ever recorded  The British handed control of southern Basra to the Iraqi government  And in Diyala  one of the most dangerous regions in Iraq  al Qaeda militants tried to retake several villages around the town of Khalis  only to see U S  backed local volunteers drive the terrorists away  Tens of thousands of volunteers have joined awakening councils that aim to combat al Qaeda  and al Qaedas number two  Aymal al Zawahri has begun warning of traitors among the insurgents in Iraq     As a result of the hard won gains our troops have secured  General Petraeus has been able to initiate a drawdown of U S  forces  a drawdown tied not to an artificial timetable but based on security gains in country  This drawdown  beginning with the removal without replacement of some 5 000 American troops  has commenced following a dramatic drop in American casualty rates and enhanced security throughout the country     Al Qaedas leadership knows which side is winning in Iraq  Our soldiers know they have seized the momentum in this fight  Does the majority party understand that we are succeeding under the new strategy  The proponents of this bill cannot continue forever to deny or disparage the reality of progress in Iraq  or reject its connection to our new counterinsurgency strategy     As General Odierno explained  with the new counterinsurgency operations  we have been able to eliminate key safe havens  liberate portions of the population and hamper the enemys ability to conduct coordinated attacks  General Odierno went on to add that we have experienced a consistent and steady trend of increased security       and I believe continued aggressive operations by both Iraqi and coalition forces are the most effective way to extend our gains and continue to protect the citizens of Iraq     Given these realities  some proponents of precipitous withdrawal from Iraq have shifted their focus  While conceding that there have been dramatic security gains  they have begun seizing on the lackluster performance of the Iraqi government to insist that we should abandon the successful strategy and withdraw U S  forces  This would be a terrible mistake  Of course there is no question that Iraqs national leaders must do more to promote reconciliation and improve governance  and that the reduction in violence has created a window for political and economic progress that Iraqi leaders must seize  But the likelihood that they make this progress would be vastly decreased  not increased  by a precipitous U S  withdrawal  Whatever the failings of the imperfect democracy in Baghdad  they do not justify  either in terms of national interest or simple morality  abandoning it to the al Qaeda terrorists and Iranian backed militias trying to destroy it     None of this is to argue that Iraq has become completely safe  or that violence has come down to an acceptable level  or that victory lies just around the corner  On the contrary  the road ahead remains  as it always has been  long and hard  Violence is still at unacceptable levels in some parts of the country  unemployment remains high in many areas  and the Maliki government remains unwilling to function as it must  No one can guarantee success or be certain about its prospects  We can  however  be certain about the prospects for defeat if we fail to fund our troops     Make no mistake  Despite the progress I have outlined  there is no cause for complacency  Just as we have managed to turn failure into success in 2007  we can likewise turn success back into failure in 2008  if we are not careful  As Maj  Gen  Fil recently put it  progress toward securing the city remains fragile and that there is absolutely a risk of going too quickly in drawing down troops  An immediate pullout too quickly would be a real serious threat to stability here in Baghdad  he said  Al Qaeda is off balance  but they will come back swinging at us  if we give them the chance     Imagine  for a moment  if the one of those 40 attempts to force a withdrawal from Iraq had been successful earlier this year  Rather than hearing from our commanders and troops in the field about the enormous progress  the decline in violence  the Iraqis seeking to return home  the decrease in al Qaeda influence  we would hear instead a very different story  a darker one with terrible implications for the people of Iraq  the wider Middle East  and the security of the United States     Some of my colleagues would like to believe that  should the bill we are currently considering become law  without funding our troops in Iraq  it would mark the end of this long effort  They are wrong  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement  If we leave  we will be back  in Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure  Now is not the time for us to lose our resolve     That is why the Senate must adopt this amendment  The funding contained in this amendment is not  as some have characterized it  the Presidents money  This money is for the troops  This funding is to provide them with the equipment and proper training they require to fulfill their mission  funding to protect our men and women from roadside bombs and other attacks  funding to enable them to bring this war to a successful end  And if the funding is not included  the President will very rightly veto this omnibus measure     I understand the frustration that many feel after nearly four years of mismanaged war  I share their frustration and sadness  But we must remember to whom we owe our allegiance  Not to short term political gain  but to the security of America  to those brave men and women who risk all to ensure it  and to the ideals upon which our nation was founded  That responsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged by history to have discharged it honorably will  in the end  matter so much more to all of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim  electoral advantage or office  Let us not sacrifice the remarkable gains our servicemen and women have made by engaging in a game of political brinksmanship  There is far too much at stake     I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  to fund our troops  and to support them so that  when they do return to us  they return with the honor and success their valiant efforts have earned  They  and the American people whom they are entrusted to protect  deserve nothing less                                                    December 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
