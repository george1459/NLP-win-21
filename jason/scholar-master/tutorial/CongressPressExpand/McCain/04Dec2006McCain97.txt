 2006    Washington D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following remarks for the record regarding the 2007 Agriculture Appropriations Bill   Mr  President  yesterday the Senate briefly turned to H R  5384  the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2007  This bill appropriates about  98 billion in spending  an amount that is approximately  4 9 billion over the Administrations budget request  and  4 7 billion more than the House passed bill  Although we were unable to complete work on H R  5384  I want to explain my objections to the passage of this bill in its current form   Mr  President  I believe that some federal involvement is necessary to assist low income families under the food stamp program  and that we should ensure that our farmers stay out of the red  and to this end  many of the programs under the Agriculture Department are worthwhile and I support their funding  I know that many of my colleagues have spoken before the Senate about the economic struggles of  America s farmers  But as Congress looks ahead towards legislating a new farm bill in the near future  next year in fact  we once again conform to the practice of diverting taxpayer dollars into an array of special interest pork projects which have not been authorized or requested by the Administration   Lets take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this bill and accompanying report    3 5 million for fruit fly control in   Texas   which was not in the Administrations budget request    400 000 for codling moth research in  Kerneysville  West Virginia   which was not in the Administrations budget request    200 000 for research into the genetic enhancement of barely in  Aberdeen  Idaho   which was not in the Administrations budget request    300 000 for grass research in burns   Oregon   which was not in the Administrations budget request    750 000 to the Denali Commission to improve solid waste disposal sites in  Alaska   which was not in the Administrations budget request    200 000 for the   Utah  State  University s Space Dynamics Laboratory to study gaseous emissions from agriculture operations  which was not in the Administrations budget request     100 000 to study crop pollination by bees   Logan  UT   which was not in the Administrations budget request    600 000 for the U S  Dairy Forage Research Center in  Madison  Wisconsin   which was not in the Administrations budget request    250 000 for shellfish and salmon research   Franklin  Maine   which was not in the Administrations budget request    250 000 for the  Great Lakes  Aquaculture  Center    Coshocton  Ohio   which was not in the Administrations budget request    158 000 for cranberry research   Massachusetts    1 4 million for Potato Research  state not listed     453 000 for seafood safety research    Massachusetts     4 1 million for shrimp aquiculture research in AZ  HI  MA  MS  SC  and TX    780 000 for milk safety research at  Pennsylvania State University  PA   which was not in the Administrations budget request    170 000 for blackbird management in the State of  Kansas   which was not in the Administrations budget request   Mr  President  its worth noting what were already doing to support our nations agriculture producers  Last year  federal farm subsidies grew to more than  23 billion despite near record farm revenue which reached  76 billion  While some of these farm programs make good fiscal sense  other have become alarmingly wasteful and counterproductive   For example  The Washington Post recently exposed a USDA program  known as direct and counter cyclical payments  that in 2005 paid out  1 3 billion to farmers irrespective of high or low market prices or whether they grew any crops at all  This program was intended to be a temporary subsidy that would prop up farmers during poor market conditions  but the special interests and the farm lobby convinced Congress to keep this unneeded program  which has become perhaps the most abused farm subsidy in existence   The Washington Post also discovered that in 2002 and 2003   635 million in drought assistance went to ranchers and dairy farmers whose livestock experienced mild or no drought at all  Thanks to strong lobbying by cattle growers  the Congress modified the payment requirements under the Livestock Compensation program for 2002 2003  so that ranchers werent required to prove they suffered any actual losses  So long as a the disaster was declared  the government simply mailed checks to ranchers dependant only on the number of cattle they owned   In an offshoot of the USDAs drought relief efforts  the federal government paid  34 million to compensate catfish farmers for feed they purchased during the 2002 drought year  even though feed prices were at a ten year low  Much like the cattle program  catfish farmers were not required to prove they suffered any losses  All they had to do was tell the USDA how much feed they bought that year   Who is at fault for this egregious waste  The farmer  The Department of Agriculture  In reality  both are the victims of bad policy  Unfortunately  the biggest victim is the taxpayer  and the blame rests with us  the Congress  Our current farm policy is riddled with waste  Yet we compound matters by furthering the out of control earmarking of pork   Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to insert into the record copies of The Washington Post articles I cited  Farm Program Pays   13 Billion to People Who Dont Farm  July 2  2006   No Drought Required For Federal Drought Aid  July 18  2006   and When Feed Was Cheap  Catfish Farmers Got Help Buying It  July 18  2006    Mr  President  its difficult to overlook the  4 5 billion disaster assistance package that appropriators have attached to this bill  None of this funding under this agricultural title is included in the administration s request  and in fact  was strongly opposed by the Administration when similar provision were added to the 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  My colleagues may recall that the emergency supplemental faced a veto threat because of the billions of dollars in unrequested agriculture handouts appropriators were seeking  Fortunately these agriculture subsidies were removed in conference  and the bill was finally enacted enabling crucial funding to reach out troops overseas   Lets take a look at some of the provisions in this latest Agriculture disaster package    1 billion in crop disaster assistance to compensate farmers for damage that occurred in 2005 due to weather  This also specifically applies to the Mormon Cricket infestation in Nevada  and flooding in California  Hawaii and   Vermont    13 million to help Ewe Lamb farmers whove suffered populations losses    6 million to owners of flooded crop and grazing land in   North Dakota    6 million to assist a sugarcane transportation cooperative in  Hawaii    100 million for grants to each state to promote specialty crop production    1 7 billion in assistance to dairy farmers who suffered losses in 2005   Mr  President  this appropriations measure is not expected to receive any further action during this session of Congress  Instead of debating and passing our annual spending bills  our constitutional obligation  were resorting to passing continuing resolutions to maintain our government functions well into fiscal year 2007  This failure is partially because of our habit of earmarking  When members frantically look for appropriation bills as vehicles for pet projects and unrequested earmarks  the appropriation process becomes a game of you vote for my pork  Ill vote for yours  This is the sad state of our appropriations process  when wed rather postpone funding for critical programs for our farmers  soldiers  veterans and seniors and nearly everything until next year if it means our pork isnt included this round   Mr  President  again I want to make it clear that I support doing all that we can for the American farmer  Agriculture production is part of the backbone of our great country  However  we do more bad than good by raiding the national treasury  and in some cases other Agriculture programs  to pay for pet projects that in many cases benefits a certain constituency which is not representative of the larger needs of the farming community                                                                              December 2006 Press Releases           Browse by                                                                              Current record
