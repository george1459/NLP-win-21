                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON THE SECURE BORDERS  ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2007 May 25  2007 WASHINGTON  D C    Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement regarding the Secure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007      Mr  President  immigration reform is long overdue and I am proud to support this historic overhaul of our immigration system  This bill represents weeks  months and in some cases years of work by the proponents of this bill  The President shown tremendous leadership on this issue and has dedicated countless hours to this process  While I may not be in agreement with each and every provision in this bill   likely no one is   it offers a very good starting point for this debate      The proponents of this bill have come together to try to fix one of the most serious issues facing out country  We have put partisan politics aside in order to forge a consensus proposal to allow us to start a full floor debate on immigration reform  Others need to do the same       Those of us from border stateswitness every day the impact illegal immigration is having on our friends and neighbors  our county and city services  our economy and our environment  We deal with the degradation of our lands and the demands imposed on our hospitals and other public resources  However  I have learned over the last several years that this is not only a    border state    problem  This is a national problem  It affects the dairy farmers in Vermontand the cattlemen in Colorado  It also affects the poultry processors in Georgia  the construction worker in Nevada  and the housewife in Maine  Our current system doesn   t protect us from people who want to harm us  It does not meet the needs of our economy  And it leaves too many people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse       Throughout this debate  we will be reminded that immigration is a national security issue  and it is  It is also a matter of life and death  We have hundreds of people trying to cross our borders every day and an estimated 12 million people living in the shadows of our country  While we believe that the majority are hard working people contributing to our economy and society  we can also assume there are some people who want to do us harm hiding among the millions who have come here only in search of better lives for themselves and their families  We need new policies that will allow us to concentrate our resources on finding those who have come here for purposes more dangerous than finding a job       Last year the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill  but it never even got to conference  This year  we realized that we had to take a different approach if we wanted to enact real reforms  New ideas and concepts were incorporated into the bill that help to enhance the comprehensive nature of the bill and ensure that the strongest tools were in place to enforce our laws and secure our border       First and foremost among our priorities was to ensure this bill included strong border security and enforcement provisions  We need to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security has the resources it needs to secure our borders to the greatest extent possible  These include man power  vehicles  and detention facilities for those apprehended  But we also need to take a 21st century approach to this 21st century problem  We need to create virtual barriers as well  through the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems  ground censors  cameras  vehicle barriers  advanced communications systems and the most up to date security technologies available to us      This legislation mandates that before we can move forward with a program to address the undocumented workers currently in the US or future workers wishing to enter  we must meet certain enforcement and security benchmarks that will let everyone know that we are enforcing our laws and that we are not going to repeat the 1986 amnesty  These triggers include the hiring of 20 000 Border Patrol agents  the construction of 300 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles of fencing  the establishment of 150 ground based radar and camera towers along the southern border  and the deployment of 4 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and supporting systems  It also includes the end of catch and release  the ability to detain up to 31 500 aliens per day on an annual basis  the use of secure and effective identification tools to prevent unauthorized work and the ability receiving  processing and adjudicating of applications for the undocumented workers that are applying for legal status  Every one of these items must be in place and fully funded before a single temporary worker enters our country or a single undocumented immigrant receives a permanent legal status in the US  I believe these requirements are a substantial improvement over previous measures       Not only will this legislation finally accomplish the extraordinary goal of securing our borders  but it will also greatly improve interior enforcement and put employers on notice that the practice of hiring illegal workers simply will not be tolerated     Business as usual    is no longer acceptable and neither is a defacto amnesty  This legislation would put in place an effective and practical Employment Verification System to replace the outdated I 9 system that all employers use today  In the 21st century it is unacceptable that employers are still recording important employment eligibility information with a pen and pad  We need real time answers that will tell employers if the person sitting in front of them is not only eligible to work here but the person they are actually claim to be  Employers will no longer be put in the position of judging documents that are presented to them at face value  The employment verification system in this bill will allow employers to electronically verify identity and work eligibility through both DHS and the Social Security Administration while also protecting the personal information of all USworkers  If we cannot adequately enforce our immigration laws at the worksite  employers will be able to continue to employ undocumented workers  and that is not a scenario we will allow under this legislation       We need the ability to have additional legal workers in this country  There are certain jobs that Americans are simply not willing to do  For example  today in California  fruit is rotting on the vine and lettuce is dying in the fields because farmers can t find workers to harvest their crops  At the same time  resorts in my own state of Arizonacannot open to capacity because there aren   t enough workers to clean the rooms  Restaurants are locking their doors because there is no one to serve the food or clear the dishes  We are facing a situation whereby the U S population does not provide the workers that businesses desperately need  yet the demand for their services and products continues       At the same time  we have seen time and again under the current law that as long as there are jobs available in this country for people who live in poverty and hopelessness in other countries  those people will risk their lives to cross our borders  Our reforms need to reflect that reality  and help us separate economic immigrants from security risks  This legislation does just that       The most effective border protection tool we have is establishing a legal channel for workers to enter the United Statesafter they have passed background checks and have secured employment  We need to establish a temporary worker program that permits workers from other countries B to the extent they are needed B to fill jobs that would otherwise go unfilled on a truly temporary basis       Under this legislation  workers could participate in a new    Y    visa program and would be allowed to come for 2 years at a time to fill positions that no American worker wants  They will be able to renew this visa twice  but must wait outside of the country for one year between each renewal  We need temporary workers that are truly temporary  coming to fill gaps in our economy and earn enough money to better the lives of their family back home  This program needs to be flexible to meet our labor market needs on a short term bases without creating a surplus of low skilled labor that could drive down the wages of US workers  The temporary worker program in this bill will help to strengthen our economy and provide legal avenues for workers to enter  encouraging them to be open to new opportunities that maximize their earning potential while they are guests in our nation       For those workers that would like to come on a permanent bases and become citizens  the reforms in this bill establish a process by which our country will finally have a system that emphasizes immigrants that contribute to the economic and cultural growth of our nation  ending the practice of  chain migration  and allow America to compete with other nations for the best and the brightest the world has to offer  As David Brooks wrote in The New York Times on Tuesday  5 22 07     The United States is the Harvard of the world  Millions long to get in  Yet has this country set up an admissions system that encourages hard work  responsibility and competition  No  Under our current immigration system  most people get into the U S  through criminality  nepotism or luck  The current system does almost nothing to encourage good behavior or maximize the nation   s supply of human capital         Let   s look at how this bill would improve incentives almost every step of the way    First  consider the 10 to 12 million illegal immigrants who are already here  They now have an incentive to think only in the short term  They have little reason to invest for the future because their presence here could be taken away   This bill would encourage them to think in the long term  To stay  they would have to embark on a long  13 year process  They   d have to obey the law  learn English and save money  to pay the stiff fines   Suddenly  these people would be lifted from an underclass environment     semi separate from mainstream society     and shifted into a middle class environment  enmeshed within the normal rules and laws that the rest of us live by  This would be the biggest values shift since welfare reform   Second  consider the millions living abroad who dream of coming to the U S  Currently  they have an incentive to find someone who can smuggle them in  and if they get caught they have an incentive to try and try again    The Senate bill reduces that incentive for lawlessness  If you think it is light on enforcement  read the thing  It would not only beef up enforcement on the border  but would also create an electronic worker registry  People who overstay their welcome could forfeit their chance of being regularized forever   Moreover  aspiring immigrants would learn  from an early age  what sort of person the U S is looking for  In a break from the current system  this bill awards visas on a merit based points system that rewards education  English proficiency  agricultural work experience  home ownership and other traits  Potential immigrants would understand that the U S is looking for people who can be self sufficient from the start  and they   d mold themselves to demonstrate that ability         In essence  we are rewarding people for working hard and showing potential  These are not all high skilled workers  but are the kind of workers and people that we should want to become citizens of our country  By combining family ties with economic realities  we can build a stronger immigration system that will help to build a stronger  more competitive economy and nation       In addition to a future immigrant and non immigrant workers  we have to address the fact that 11 12 million people are living in the United Statesillegally  most of them employed  all of them contributing to our country  Our economy has come to depend on people whose existence in our country is furtive  whose whereabouts and activities  in many cases  are unknown  I have listened to and understand the concerns of those who simply advocate sealing our borders and making life so terrible for people here that they will self deport  But that   s easier said then done  Mr  President  I fundamentally believe that our Judeo Christian society would not tolerate this type of treatment of people within our own country  whether here legally or not  We need to come up with a humane  moral way to deal with those people that are here  most of whom aren   t going anywhere  No matter how much we improve border security  No matter the penalties we impose on their employers  No matter how seriously they are threatened with punishment  We won   t find most of them  And we won   t find most of their employers       The opponents of our proposal to address undocumented workers in this country decry as amnesty our proposal to bring them out from their shadows and into compliance with our laws  No  Mr  President  it is not  Amnesty is  as I observed  for all practical purposes what exists today  We can pretend otherwise  but that doesn   t make it so  Amnesty is simply declaring people who entered the country illegally citizens of the United States  and imposing no other requirements on them  That is not what we do  Mr  President      Under the provisions of our legislation  undocumented workers will have incentives to declare their existence and comply with our laws  They may apply for a worker visa  They would be subjected to background checks  They must pay substantial fines and fees totally approximately  7000  learn English  enroll in civic education  remain employed  and if they choose to get a Green Card  go to the end of the line behind those that waited legally outside of the country to come in  I believe most undocumented workers will accept these requirements in order to escape the fear  uncertainty and vulnerability to exploitation they currently endure  And while those who have come here to do us harm won t come out of hiding to accept these conditions  we will at least be spared the Herculean task of finding and sorting through millions of people who came here simply to earn a living       Mr  President  we are aware of the burdens illegal immigrants impose on our cities and counties and states  Those burdens  which are a federal responsibility  must be addressed  And we need also to face honestly the moral consequences of our current failed immigration system       I am hopeful that at the end of this debate  we can show the American people that we addressed a serious and urgent problem with sound judgment  honesty  common sense and compassion  I hope we can show that we reached across the aisle to try and solve a serious problem in a serious way       It seems almost trite at this point to once again state that our nation   s immigration system is broken and is badly in need of repair  but without comprehensive immigration reform  it is a fact that our nation   s security will remain vulnerable  We must act immediately or face the consequences of another summer of people dying in our deserts  businesses shutting their doors because they don   t have the man power to stay open  and criminals hiding in the shadows of our society mixed in with hard working people that are the back bone of our economy      The US Senate must have the courage and will to solve this crisis facing out nation  The American people are demanding action  I say the time is overdue and we are failing the citizens of the United Statesif we do not pass this important piece of legislation and ultimately achieve its enactment and implementation  If we do fail  what then                                                 May 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
