                                                                                                                         STATEMENT BY SENATOR McCAIN ON THE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT CONFERENCE REPORT September 24  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record on the Conference Report for the Water Resources Development Act of 2007     Mr  President  I would like to express my strong opposition to the Conference Report on the Water Resources Development Act of 2007  The legislation being considered today far exceeds the already outrageous spending that was approved in both the House  and Senate passed bills and would drastically increase the backlog of Army Corps of Engineers construction projects while doing nothing to modernize the system for funding these projects  I wonder  did we learn nothing from Hurricane Katrina     In August of 2005  this nation witnessed a horrible national disaster  When Hurricane Katrina hit  it brought with it destruction and tragedy beyond compare  more so than our nation had seen in decades  Almost two years later  the Gulf Coast region is still trying to rebuild and there is a long road ahead  I thought that we had learned a few lessons from this tragedy  but as our nation continues to dedicate significant resources to the reconstruction effort  we are now being asked to quickly approve a conference report that only perpetuates the problems with both the funding and management of the Corps of Engineers     During Senate consideration of this bill  Senator Feingold offered an amendment that I was pleased to cosponsor that would have established a system to give clarity to the process used for funding Corps projects  Of course  that amendment was not adopted  It is unacceptable to me that this Congress isnt interested in how best to allocate our limited Corps resources or how taxpayer dollars would be used most effectively  My question is  what is wrong with having some concept of what our nations priorities are for waterworks projects  Why are we rejecting policies to help us identify where the greatest infrastructure needs are  Are people worried that showing the American people how their money is really being spent may result in their pet project being moved down the list for funding     Todays practice  as illustrated again by this legislation  allows a member of Congress to get a project authorized and funded without having any idea of how that project affects the overall infrastructure of our nations waterways    or whether it is even needed  Mr  President  there is already a  58 billion backlog in Corps projects and the bill before us increases that backlog by an additional  23 2 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office  That is a 40  increase in the size of the existing backlog  Yet consider how much funding the Corps receives annually on average     2 billion  Anyone can do the math and realize that we are perpetuating a significant problem  But that wont stop so many of my colleagues from congratulating themselves on passage of this bill    a bill the White House intends to veto     I find it particularly ironic  Mr  President  that just before the August recess this body claimed to be turning a new page and taking significant steps towards ending the process of secret earmarks and pork barrel politics when it passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007  This bill is beyond more of the same with over 900 projects  up from 600 projects in both the Senate and the House passed bills  As stated in a recent letter from the Director of OMB and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works  Because the conference version of H R  1495 significantly exceeds the cost of either the House or Senate bill and contains other unacceptable provisions discussed below  the President will veto the bill  I applaud the Presidents vow to veto this bill     While the bill before us today includes an independent review process in name  as Senator Feingold and I have pushed for during debate on the last two Senate passed bills  the conference report provision does not promote true independent review at all  Senator Feingold and I championed language that would have established a process by which the planning and design of Corps projects could be reviewed by a panel of experts  As stated by an editorial in the Washington Post on August 6  2007  entitled Watered Down  The Corps has a long history of overly rosy environmental and economic analysis of such projects  tailored to the political needs of its funders in Congress  Review of Corps projects by independent experts would deter such behavior  which threatens not only the federal budget but public safety  The Senate version of the legislation was very tough on this point  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks     Mr  President  the legislation before us drastically dilutes the Senate passed provision and gives the Corps undue influence over this panel  The review process will actually be housed within the Corps rather than outside the agency as the Senate bill required and the Corps Chief of Engineers is also given significant authority to decide the timing of review  the projects to be reviewed  and whether to implement a review panels recommendations  This new system will only compound the problems with an agency that has brought about countless mismanaged and incredibly expensive construction and maintenance projects     I believe this conference report is fundamentally flawed in many ways  not the least of which is its cost  As stated by the Tax Payers for Common Sense  In High School Civics students learn that conference committees are where lawmakers hash out the differences between House and Senate bills  But in the case of WRDA  H R  1495   the Corps of Engineers water projects bill  a  14 billion Senate bill met a  15 billion house and ballooned into a whopping  21 billion monster The ultimate price tag will be far higher because of numerous policy changes that are intended to shift costs from who benefits onto the federal taxpayer  For these reasons  the President did the right thing by promising to veto the bill if it gets to his desk Lawmakers should start over again and come back with a fiscally responsible bill that includes stronger policy reforms for independent peer review of costly  controversial  or critical projects  modernized economic guidance and creates a system to prioritize limited federal funding  All these proposals will save taxpayers in the long term     Mr  President  it is time that we end this process of blind spending  throwing money at projects that may or may not benefit the larger good  It is time for us to take a post Katrina look at the world and learn from our experiences over the past years instead of being content with business as usual  Shouldn t we be doing all that we can to reform the Corps and ensure that the most urgent projects are being funded and constructed  Or  are we more content with needless earmarks    too often at the expense of projects that are of most need     I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference report                                             September 2007
