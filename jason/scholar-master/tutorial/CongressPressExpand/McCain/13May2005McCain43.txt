2005 Senator John McCain today issued the following statement on the Pentagon s recommendations for military base closings   Today  the Department of Defense released a list of military bases and facilities recommended for realignment or closure  I am extremely pleased that the Department has recognized the positive impact of all Arizona bases to our National Security by not recommending any bases for closure or realignment to the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission  All 14 military installations will continue to receive my full support and the support of the other members of Arizona s congressional delegation  as well as the support of Arizona state officials  as we strive to strengthen the value each base brings to our nation s military forces   While I regret the closing of any U S  military installation and the effects on the surrounding community  this process will result in a  48 8 billion savings over 20 years that can be used to benefit the men and women of the Armed Services through acquisition of new military equipment and improved quality of life  ensuring our ability to fight the war on terrorism for years to come   I encourage the commission to make every effort to ensure that all criteria were properly used in developing this list of bases for closure and realignment  I m certain that the commission will listen to the affected bases and communities in their review process  as they prepare their final recommendation for the President this fall    Attached is a detailed description of key Arizona installations and how they are affected by the realignment recommendations   KEY ARIZONA INSTALLATIONS REALIGNMENT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE   Luke Air Force Base  AFB   Phoenix West Valley  Luke Air Force Base  AFB  will remain the largest
