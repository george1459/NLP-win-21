                                                                                                                         McCAIN INTRODUCES THE DEFENSE ACQUISTION REFORM ACT OF 2007 May 22  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record regarding the Defense Acquisition Reform Act of 2007    Mr  President  I am introducing this omnibus defense acquisition reform bill today to highlight the scope and urgent need for meaningful reform in how the Pentagon procures its biggest and most expensive weapons systems    Defense acquisition policy has been a major issue ever since President Eisenhower first warned the Nation  in 1961  about the military industrial complex  As Operation Ill Wind in the 1980s and the Boeing Tanker Lease scandal just a few years ago have taught us  Eisenhower   s comments apply with equal force today    Despite the lessons of the past  the acquisition process continues to be dysfunctional  In the 110th Congress  major acquisition policy issues have arisen in some of the biggest defense programs  including the Navy transformational program  Littoral Combat Systems   LCS   and the Air Force   s second largest acquisition program  Combat  and Rescue Vehicle Replacement Program   CSAR X      We can do much to ensure that taxpayers    dollars are spent wisely in developing  testing and acquiring major defense systems  By increasing transparency and accountability and maximizing competition  meaningful acquisition reform can provide the taxpayer with the best value  minimize waste  fraud and abuse  and  perhaps most importantly  help guarantee that the US maintains the strongest  most capable fighting force in the world  That is what this legislative proposal is all about    Our colleagues in the House Armed Services Committee have already taken considerable steps in this area which I applaud  It is my intention to offer this acquisition package to the defense authorization bill this week  The defense bill which we will be considering this week in the Committee on Armed Services totals more than  650 billion  That   s serious money   As stewards of the taxpayers    dollars we must assure the public that we are buying the best programs for our servicemen and women at the best price for the taxpayer  I have already highlighted critical weapon systems with key acquisition problems  If we continue to buy weapon systems in an ineffective and inefficient manner so that costs continue to go up or the deployment of the system is delayed  it will only hurt the soldier  sailor  airman  or Marine in the field   The reason for this is quite simple  First  it does not take an economics degree to understand that the higher that costs of a weapon system unexpectedly goes up  the fewer of them we can buy  A prime example is the F 22 Raptor  The original requirement was for 781 jet fighters  now we can only afford 183  In addition  without fundamental reforms  such as I have proposed in this bill  we will continue to buy weapon systems in an ineffective manner  which usually results in long delays and unexpected cost growth  as requirements  acquisition policy and resources never get in synch   Mr  President  one aspect of how the Pentagon buys the biggest weapons systems that my proposal addresses head on is the  requirements process   that is  the process by which the Pentagon defines the weapon system it wants to procure  All too often  costly requirements  many of which are unrelated to what the unified commands say they need  are piled on to these programs irresponsibly   without regard to the bottom line  Just as egregious is the tendency to drop requirements that the warfighter has said they need   which sometimes justified the system in the first instance    There is an emerging consensus that one way of addressing these  and related  problems is by integrating processes  that is  aligning the acquisition  resources  and requirements spheres of the procurement process in a way that provides the necessary accountability and agility for the Pentagon to make sound judgments on its defense investments  Historically  each sphere has been stove piped and allowed to operate independently in a way that has produced poor cost   scheduling  and performance outcomes   to the detriment of both the taxpayer and the warfighter    Elements of this legislative proposal that provide for  integrated processes  include  1  having the Service Chiefs help oversee acquisition management decisions   2  standing up a  tri chair committee   so called because it will be headed by the primary players in the acquisition  resources and requirements communities  that can help make enterprise wide investment decisions more powerfully and with greater agility than any other procurement related organization currently within the Pentagon   3  increasing the membership of the Pentagon   s main requirements setting body to include leadership from all three spheres  and  4  setting out guidelines that  when coupled with certain provisions currently under law  can help the Pentagon better manage unexpected cost growth    Other elements of this proposal address particular structural problems in major weapons procurement that Congress has observed over the last few years  One such provision restricts the Services from entering into multiyear contracts irresponsibly when buying weapons  Buying weapons under a multiyear contract restricts Congress    ability to exercise appropriate oversight  If Congress bought these items under a series of annual contracts  there would be a meaningful opportunity for it to annually review the programs    progress  For this reason  using multiyear contracts should be limited to only the best performing and most stable programs  The approach provided for under this legislative proposal would help to ensure that    Other elements of this proposal would help reign in abuses in how the government pays award fees and require defense contractors to maintain a robust internal ethics compliance program that can help maintain effective oversight of defense programs    In developing this reform package  I have pulled the  best of the best   that is  the best  most powerful ideas which enjoy the broadest consensus among some of the most respected experts  whose ideas have been ventilated in public hearings and reports over the last three years  including the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment Report  a k a  the DAPA or the Kadish Report   the Center for Strategic International Studies     CSIS  Beyond Goldwater Nichols Report  the Section 804 Report from the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition  Technology and Logistics  a number of reports and analyses from the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service  and others  Some of the elements of this package also institutionalize good ideas that the Pentagon has informally put in place recently    Mr  President  acquisition reform of a bureaucracy as large as the Pentagon does not happen overnight  That is why we need to act now  Our defense spending has doubled in the last decade  from  350 billion to  650 billion  Every American I talk to as I cross the country understands that we need to spend as much as necessary for national defense  However  how much is enough  Taxpayers also expect that we spend his or her hard earned tax dollars in a sound and cost effective manner  We have not been fulfilling that expectation  We need to  This proposed legislation sets us on that course    Chairman Levin and I have discussed the need for greater oversight in the Senate Armed Services Committee and the common goal of producing concrete results on acquisition reform this year  I look forward to working with Chairman Levin to fully adopt this acquisition package this week and also working with his capable staff in taking comprehensive steps  similar to what our House colleagues have done  to assure that we buy weapon systems at the best price and field them as soon as practicable   Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be printed at the conclusion of my statement   Thank you  I yield the floor                                              May 2007
