                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF LOBBYING REFORM BILL March 30  2006  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  submitted for the record the following statement on the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006  Mr  President  let me begin by commending the hard work of my colleagues in this effort  The Chair and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee Senators Collins and Lieberman  and the Chair and ranking member of the Rules Committee Senators Lott and Dodd  have worked tirelessly and in a bipartisan manner to bring a bill to the floor  I regret  however  that I find it necessary to vote against final passage of this measure because it simply doesnt do enough to address the critical need for comprehensive lobbying reform  We had a golden opportunity to institute real reform and prove to the American people that we are not completely oblivious to their concerns  Unfortunately  Mr  President  we dropped the ball   While it does contain some good provisions to increase lobbyist disclosure and reporting requirements  the bill lacks imperative enforcement measures  We can pass all of the Rules changes we want in this body  but they are useless unless we back it up with a tough enforcement mechanism  I was disappointed that the Collins Lieberman McCain amendment to create a Senate Office of Public Integrity was defeated yesterday  That office would have had the ability to investigate complaints of ethical violations by Senators  staff  or officers of this chamber  Headed by a Director appointed by the President Pro Tem of the Senate upon the joint recommendation of the majority and minority leaders  the Office of Public Integrity would investigate complaints of rules violations filed with or initiated by the Office   At a time when the public is questioning our integrity  the Senate needs to more aggressively enforce its own rules  We should do this not just by making more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee currently undertakes  but by addressing the conflict that is inherent in any body that regulates itself  By rejecting the creation of a new office with the capacity to conduct and initiate investigations  and a perspective uncolored by partisan concerns or collegial relationships  we neglected to address this long standing structural problem   The proposed Office of Public Integrity would not only have assisted in performing existing investigative functions  but would also have been charged with approving or denying requests for travel by members and staff  Rather than prohibit official travel paid for by any entity other than the federal government  as some have proposed  our proposal would have required that all travel to be pre cleared  The purpose of this pre clearance was to ensure that the trips serve a legitimate governmental interest  and are not substantially recreational in nature  The Office of Public Integrity would have been an appropriate entity to conduct these reviews   but  sadly  the Senate voted to maintain the status quo   Another critical aspect of reform that is not addressed in this bill is the ability of a Member to travel on a corporate jet and only pay the rate of a first class plane ticket  Because cloture was invoked on this bill yesterday  Senator Santorum and I were prevented from offering an amendment that would have required Senators and their employees who use corporate or charter aircraft to pay the fair market value for that travel   Senator Santorum and I were well aware that our amendment would not be popular with some of our colleagues  but we felt that the time had come for us to fundamentally change the way we do things in this town  Much of the public views our ability to travel on corporate jets  often accompanied by lobbyists  while only reimbursing the first class rate  as a huge loophole in the current gift rules  And theyre right   it is  I have no doubt that the average American would love to fly around the country on very comfortable corporate owned aircraft and only be charged the cost of a first class ticket  Its a pretty good deal weve got going here  We need to face the fact that the time has come to end this Congressional perk   There is a public perception that these lobbyist arranged flights unduly influence Members of Congress and serve as a way for lobbyists to curry favor with legislators and their aides  We must change that perception  Mr  President  There was nothing in our amendment that would have prohibited a Member from using corporate aircraft   it simply required that they pay the fair market value of the flight  It was a fair  reasonable approach designed to prove to the American public that we are serious about reform and would do what is necessary to restore the publics trust   but  again  the Senate chose to maintain the status quo by preventing us from offering our amendment   Finally  Mr  President  this bill does not go far enough to reign in the practice of earmarking federal funds in the annual appropriations bills  Together with Sens  Coburn  Ensign  Feingold  Kyl  DeMint  Sununu  and Graham  I was prepared to offer an amendment that would amend the Senate Rules to allow points of order to be raised against unauthorized appropriations  earmarks  and policy riders in appropriations bills and conference reports in an effort to reign in wasteful pork barrel spending  If the point of order were successful  the objectionable provisions would be stricken and the related funding would be reduced accordingly  Once again  we were blocked from offering this amendment as well   In my judgement  if we are really committed to addressing comprehensive lobbying reform in a meaningful and effective way  we need to include earmark reform provisions in this legislative package  The process is clearly broken when each year Congress continues to earmark billions and billions of taxpayers dollars  sometimes with little or almost no knowledge about the specifics of those earmarks by most of the members of this body  Sadly  the scandal that has come to light recently concerning the earmarking by one former member of the House is a pox not just on him  but on each of us and the process that we have allowed to occur on our watch  The American public deserves better and that is what my amendment was about   In 1994  there were 4 126 earmarks  In 2005  there were 15 877  an increase of nearly 400 percent  But there was a little good news for 2006 solely due to the good sense that occurred unexpectedly when the Labor HHS appropriations bill was approved with almost no earmarks  an amazing feat given that there were over 3 000 earmarks the prior year for just that bill  Yet despite this first reduction in 12 years  it doesnt change the fact that the largest number of earmarks have still occurred in the last three years2004  2005  and 2006   Now  lets consider the level of funding associated with those earmarks  The amount of earmarked funding increased from  23 2 billion in 1994 to  64 billion in FY 2006  Remarkably  it rose by 34 percent from 2005 to 2006  even though the number of earmarks decreased  Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000  and more than tripled in the last 10 years  This is wrong and disgraceful and we urgently need to make some changes in this process   Mr  President  we  as Members  owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in a way that reinforces  rather than diminishes  the publics faith and confidence in Congress  An informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy  And  a democratic government operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye  This bill could go so much further to balance the right of the public to know with its right to petition government  the ability of lobbyists to advocate their clients causes with the need for truthful public discourse  and  the ability of Members to legislate with the imperative that our government must be free from corrupting influences  both real and perceived  We must act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the publics confidence in Congress does not become a collapse of confidence  We can  and we must  do better than this bill    end
