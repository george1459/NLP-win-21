                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON AMENDMENT TO EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL May 2  2006 Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  submitted for the record the following statement in support of his amendment  To Strike  6 Million to Sugarcane Growers in Hawaii  to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill   Mr  President  I call up Amendment  3617 and ask for its immediate consideration  This amendment would strike the  6 million earmark for Sugarcane Growers in Hawaii  which was not included in the Administration s emergency supplemental request   Mr  President  this bill includes a massive  3 94 billion Agriculture Assistance program  None of the funding under the agriculture title was included in the administration s emergency supplemental request   I m all for helping to the extent appropriate farmers battered by hurricanes  And as my colleagues know  the USDA currently has a range of disaster assistance programs    including crop insurance programs    that are already available to farmers  But the victims of the 2005 hurricane season and the American taxpayers who will be paying for this bill should be made aware how taxpayer dollars are being allocated for agriculture subsidies and bail outs which  in some cases  have nothing to do with hurricane recovery  For example  under this bill    15 million goes to the USDA Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention program   This program already exists and is meant to assist with lamb breeding stock needs  not hurricane recovery    400 000 goes to the Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers for assistance with sugarcane storage and transportation costs at the Port of Baton Rouge  TX   Among the many sugar growers nationwide  why are we providing an earmark to this particular group    120 million is for Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Disaster Assistance in Florida   Rather than using the existing USDA disaster assistance programs  this legislation would establish a special program that caters directly and solely to Florida sugar    6 million to compensate owners of flooded crop and grazing land in North Dakota  Hurricanes in North Dakota  Interestingly  North Dakota is one of the nation s top producers of  you guessed it  sugar   Mr  President  the amendment I offer today would strike an earmark in the bill that provides  6 million to sugarcane growers in Hawaii  Obviously  the Hawaiian Islands weren t anywhere near the path of the 2005 hurricanes  Certainly  it is appropriate that any farmer impacted by a natural disaster can seek federal assistance  which as I already said  is why there are existing USDA disaster recovery programs authorized under the 2002 Farm Bill  But in this case  the appropriators are establishing a special program that caters directly to Hawaiian sugar growers via a must pass emergency appropriations bill   According to the bill  the Secretary shall use  6 million to assist sugarcane growers in Hawaii by making a payment in that amount to an agricultural transportation cooperative in Hawaii  the members of which are eligible to receive marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments  I can only assume this funding will be directed to the Hawaiian Sugar  Transportation Cooperative  the entity that received  7 2 million from a nearly identical provision in last year s Military Construction Appropriations and Emergency Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations Act  2005   I am informed the members are the Gay  Robinson Sugar Company  Island of Kauai  and the Hawaiian Commercial Sugar Company  Island of Maui   These are producer owned sugarcane mills that own their sugarcane land  Let me repeat  this same cooperative got a bailout just a year ago  Are we now going to start providing these two companies with annual  supplemental appropriations bailouts   I urge my colleagues to question what we are doing here  Let me quote from the Administration s Statement of Administrative Policy  In 2005  many crops had record or near record production  and U S  farm sector cash receipts were the second highest ever  Furthermore  the proposed level of assistance is excessive and may over compensate certain producers for their losses  Mr  President  what are we trying to do with this bill  Are we trying to tell our farmers   No matter where you are or what you farm  don t bother with crop insurance because come next year s supplemental  we ll dole out far more than you need   See Attached Article w  Secretary of Ag Johanns Quote    As noted in Saturday s Washington Post Editorial  should farming be the nation s only risk free enterprise  Perhaps the intent in providing this  6 million to the Hawaiian sugar growers is to prop up a sugar industry which has fallen on hard times  With rising diabetes and child obesity rates  which have more than doubled since 1977   maybe sugar isn t in demand like previous years  Maybe the efforts by parents to have soft drink machines stripped from public schools is having a prolific effect on sugar production  If only that were the case  Mr  President  In reality  consumption of sweeteners in the U S  has risen from113 lbs per person per year in 1966 to around 142 lbs per person per year in 2004  according to the USDA  At that rate  Americans consume the equivalent of about 1 teaspoon of sugar per hour every 24 hours  seven days a week   Mr  President  U S  News and World Report compared our sugar fix to other  more nutritious agriculture commodities and found that Americans ate a dismal 8 3 pounds of broccoli a year in 2003  Again I question the need to spend more taxpayer dollars on sugarcane  Didn t we vote just last week not to fund a  15 million marketing program for seafood  Certainly less than a week later  we aren t going to turn around and vote to fund marketing loans to promote sugar  are we   I urge my colleagues to support this                                             May 2006 Press Releases           Browse by                                                              Current record
