                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 527 REFORM ACT OF 2007 January 31  2007  Mr  President  once again I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and colleague Senator Feingold from Wisconsin in introducing a bill to end the illegal practice of 527 groups spending soft money on ads and other activities to influence federal elections   This bill is very simple  It would require that all 527s register as political committees and comply with federal campaign finance laws  including federal limits on the contributions they receive  unless the money they raise and spend is only in connection with non Federal candidate elections  state or local ballot initiatives  or the nomination or confirmation of individuals to non elected offices    Additionally  this legislation would set new rules for federal political committees that spend funds on voter mobilization efforts effecting both federal and local races and  therefore  use both a federal and a non federal account under Federal Election Commission  FEC  regulations  The new rules would prevent unlimited soft money from being channeled into federal election activities by these federal political committees    Under the new rules that would be established under this bill  at least half of the funds spent on these voter mobilization activities by federal political committees would have to be hard money from their federal account  More importantly  the funds raised for their non federal account would have to come from individuals and would be limited to no more than  25 000 per year per donor  Corporations and labor unions could not contribute to these non federal accounts To put it in simple terms  a George Soros could give  25 000 per year as opposed to  10 million to finance these activities   It is unfortunate that we even need to be here introducing this bill today  This legislation would not be necessary if the FEC would enforce existing law  As my colleagues know  a number of 527 groups raised and spent a substantial amount of soft money in a blatant effort to influence the outcome of 2004 Presidential election  These activities are illegal under existing laws  but  unfortunately  the FEC has failed to implement the regulations necessary to stop these illegal activities    According to an analysis by campaign finance scholar Tony Corrado  federally oriented 527s spent  423 million to affect the outcome of the 2004 elections  The same analysis shows that ten donors gave at least  4 million each to 527s involved in the 2004 elections and two donors each contributed over  20 million  Let me be perfectly clear on one point here  Mr  President  Our proposal will NOT shut down 527s  It will simply require them to abide by the same federal regulations every other federal political committee must abide by in spending money to influence federal elections    Opponents of campaign finance reform like to point out that the activities of these 527s serve as proof that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act  BCRA  has failed in its stated purpose  which is to eliminate the corrupting influence of soft money in our political campaigns  Let me be perfectly clear on this  Mr  President  The 527 issue has nothing to do with BCRA  it has everything to do with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 and the failure of the FEC to properly regulate the activities of these groups   The bill Senator Feingold and I are introducing today is designed to put an end to the abusive  illegal practices of these 527s  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill and put an end to this problem once and for all                                                                                January 2007 Press Releases           Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Current record
