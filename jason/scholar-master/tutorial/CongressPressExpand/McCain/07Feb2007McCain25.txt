                                                                                                                         SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN REMARKS ON THE NOMINATION OF GENERAL CASEY FOR CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY February 8  2007 Washington  D C     Senator John McCain  R AZ  today  made the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding General Casey s Nomination for Chief of Staff of the United States Army  Mr  President  I come again this morning in not a particularly pleasant task of opposing the nomination of General Casey to be Chief of Staff of the United States Army  And I again preface my remarks with my appreciation for his honorable service to the country  his family  and the sacrifices that they have made for many  many years  And this isn   t a question of character  because his character is outstanding  It   s a question of judgment    Now  Mr  President  I try to put this in the context of why I   m in opposition  For several years I and a number of others have bemoaned and complained and criticized and been saddened as we   ve watched this train wreck in Iraq  Not long after the initial invasion  I came back from a visit to Iraq and visited with the then Secretary of Defense who bears great responsibility for this debacle  and history will judge him very  very badly for his performance as Secretary of Defense  and told him how imperative it was that we were not going to win  we were not going to succeed  that we didn   t have enough troops over there  that Anbar province was going to erupt and basically all the things many of us thought were going to transpire    Now  General Casey  for two and a half years  up until recently would come back to the Congress and say that things were going well  I quoted many quotes yesterday from time to time  including the 2005 one saying we could start withdrawing by 2006  and on and on  completely divorced from reality on the ground  Completely divorced  as was the Secretary of Defense  And I will state at the beginning Presidents are responsible  Presidents are responsible  But Presidents also rely on the advice and counsel of their military leaders  That   s just a normal thing to happen and has happened in every conflict  And President Bush said time and time again   I   ve said to the American people as Iraqis stand up  we   ll stand down  But I also said our commanders on the ground will make that decision  And I will talk to General Casey   On and on    The Army   s getting on its feet  We turned over a lot of territory to the army  They   re good fighters  I spent a great deal of time with General Casey there in Washington  They are generals who will happy to hear  tell me the way it is  not the way I think it would like to be  Time after time it appears the President of the United States  as appropriate  has been relying on the advice and counsel of the commanders in the field  who did not give him appropriate information or recommendations  in my view  We are all responsible  In the military you are responsible for the decisions that you make on the battlefield  particularly when they cost our money valuable and important asset  That   s American blood    In his opening statement at the Senate Armed Services Committed on September 29 he said the capacity of Iraqi forces has increased over the past year and we have developed a readiness system not unlike the one we have in place for our own forces  Over the past 18 months we have built enough Iraqi capacity where we can begin talking seriously about transitioning this counterinsurgency mission to them  Did he realize at the time the statement was wrong  And when did he tell someone  At the same hearing General Casey said more coalition is not necessarily better  More and more capable Iraqi security forces are better  Increased coalition presence speeds the notion of occupation  It contributes to the dependence of Iraqi security forces on the coalition    It extends the amount of time it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant and exposes more coalition forces to attacks at a time when Iraqi security forces are increasingly available and increasingly capable  There has been no sign of that  Mr  President  Why did it take 15 months for General Casey to change that assessment and then not even agree that the new strategy of five additional brigades  which most of us pray is enough and most of us believe is a direct contravention to the Powell Doctrine which is use overwhelming force in order to gain militarily   President Bush said General Casey will make decisions as to how many troops we have there  Why did it take two and a half years  no audio   didn t have enough troops there  And the situation is worsening in Iraq  The N I E  that came out yesterday should frighten anyone  any American because of the stark depiction in the NIE public document  That states that the situation is grave and deteriorating in Iraq  which is also the conclusions of the Iraq Study Group  whether you happen to agree with their recommendations or not  Mr  President  responsibility is one of the first things that   s taught at our service academies  We are responsible for our decisions  When the Missouri runs aground  where do we leave the captain  we relieve the captain  Now what we   re doing is we   re rewarding failure  just as we did during the Vietnam War  We named General Wes Moreland as Chief of Staff of the Army after a failed search and destroy  There are some parallels here  General Wes Moreland employed the search and destroy strategy  The counterinsurgency strategy is clear and hold and build  That   s not what has been done in the past under General Casey  So  what are we doing   We are promoting a general who has pursued a failed policy  advocated it to the President of the United States  whom he is responsible to advising  advocating it to the Congress of the United States  despite the overwhelming view by many of us that was not a successful strategy  And still today  where he will be in place if he is confirmed by the United States Senate  responsible for the operations  the training and the doctrine that will be employed in Iraq  And he still to this day  as far as I know  as far as a hearing a short time ago  believes  and I could give the quote  that we are not failing  that we are succeeding  I don   t know of anyone who believes that that   s in a responsible position in government    So  Mr  President  it is with a bit of regret I do this  Again  I would repeat what I said yesterday  Senator Levin asked him   I   m wondering whether you would agree that what we   re doing in Iraq was    maybe a slow failure      General Casey   I didn   t  I actually don   t see it as a slow failure  I actually see it as slow progress     How could you depict the situation in Baghdad today with six H L cop terse being shot down in the last few weeks  with a spike in casualties that has taken place and the continued level of sectarian violence that it   s a slow progress    So  I want to tell my friends that people in the military  particularly our young officers  are watching what we do here  We teach them  we teach them in our service schools and we teach our noncommissioned officers and our junior officers  you   re responsible  You   re responsible for success or failure  That   s why we appoint you as leaders  And in case  this leader  despite his honorable character and his dedication ton this country  has not led and his responsibility has not been carried out    So  Mr  President  I hope that my colleagues will turn down this nomination and that we will appoint one of the many  Many highly qualified military  senior military officers that we have to fulfill this position  May I just finally  say Mr  President  I   m very nervous about the new strategy  I   m not sure     in fact  I   m very doubtful we have enough troops  I don   t know if the Maliki government will be strong enough  But if General Casey is appointed to this position  my confidence will be lowered because it   s not appropriate to put someone who does not support wholeheartedly the new strategy in the position where he will be responsible for a great deal of it  And to this day doesn   t admit that this policy has  present strategy has failed  Mr  President  do I have any time remaining     I thank you  Mr  President  And let me just make it clear  I don   t support medals for failure  I don   t support promotion to higher position for failure  I believe that the awards and accolades that Senator Levin alluded to that been provided to those who have committed egregious failures was not only inappropriate  it was absolutely insulting   And I also  though  would point out that history will judge many of these people who have been give medals of various types and already that judgment has been harsh  All of us are more concerned about our place in history that we are medals  History and the American people are already judging the failures and the misleading statements like stuff happens and mission accomplished and few dead enders and last throes and all of those statements that have been made over the past 3    years which led the American people to believe that we were succeeding in Iraq when many of us knew we weren   t  We violated a fundamental principle called the Powell Doctrine  that if you want to win  you go in with overwhelming force  And the reason why I   m very concerned today  even though we have a very outstanding general in Petraeus  the fact is that I   m not sure that we have enough troops still    Mr  President  throughout our history  military commanders have been held responsible  Abraham Lincoln held General McClellan responsible and fired him in World War II  those who were in command that were responsible for December 7  1941  were held responsible  In the Korean War  General McArthur was held responsible  The fact is that military leaders are held responsible as well as civilian leaders  And Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to have put in the record the number of times President Bush said that he relied on the judgment of the military commanders  Those military commanders did not exercise good judgment and  inaccurate depiction of facts on the ground in Iraq as they came before our committee  the Armed Services Committee  and spoke to the President of the United States and the American people    Mr  President  in 2004  General Casey said   My view of winning is that are broadly on track to accomplishing our objectives  With Iraq security forces capable of maintaining domestic order and denying Iraqis a safe haven for terror  I believe we   re on track to get there by September of 2005  We have a strategy and plan for success in Iraq  We   re broadly on track in achieving our goals    Time after time  the American people were told that things were going fine  and they were not  I want to emphasize again  Mr  President  I believe that General Casey has served this nation honorably  I think his family and he have made great sacrifices for this country  I have nothing but respect  But to reward failure is going to send a message all around the military that I don   t think is a healthy one  And I don   t support promotion  I don   t support medals for failure  I support people being held responsible  and I regret that those who have been responsible for it honestly inside have not been held more responsible  Although as we speak today  the American people  by their opinions as reflected in the polls  are certainly reflecting their judgment able the performance and the responsibility of our civilian leaders  Mr  President  I hope that we can move forward and obtain success in Iraq under this new strategy  I   m not sure right now that General Casey completely supports it  And I don   t think that it enhances our chance for succeeding in Iraq  I urge my colleagues to vote                                             February 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
