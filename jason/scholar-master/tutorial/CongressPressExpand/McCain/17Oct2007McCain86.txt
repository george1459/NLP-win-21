                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON DEPT OF LABOR  HHS  EDUCATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT  FY 2008 October 23  2007    Washington  D C   Today Senator McCain spoke on the floor of the United States Senate  and submitted the following statement for the record   Mr  President  here we go again  pushing through a bloated appropriations bill chocked full of earmarks and far exceeding the President s budget request  This is the seventh annual appropriations measure that has been considered by the Senate and it is by far the biggest budget buster of those considered  The first six bills exceeded the President s request by over  8 billion  while this bill alone exceeds the President s budget request by almost  9 billion  At what point will Congress come to grips with the fact that we are mortgaging our children s and our grandchildren s futures by approving bills like this   The Department of Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education  and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 provides over  605 billion  including  149 2 billion in total discretionary spending and  as I mentioned  exceeds the President s budget by  8 95 billion  The Statement of Administration Policy begins with the following  The Administration strongly opposes S  1710 because  in combination with the other FY2008 appropriations bills  it includes an irresponsible and excessive level of spending and includes other objectionable provisions  The Statement goes on to say  The Administration has asked that Congress demonstrate a path to live within the President s topline and cover the excess spending in this bill through reductions elsewhere  while ensuring the Department of Defense has the resources necessary to accomplish its mission  Because Congress has failed to demonstrate such a path  if S  1710 were presented to the President  he would veto the bill  Well  it looks like he will have the opportunity to do just that   There are over 1 000 earmarks in this bill  Examples include     1 million for the Bethel Performing Arts Center in Liberty  NY  for the Woodstock Museum  which the Senate did strike by a vote of 52 42     500 000 for the New York Botanical Garden  Bronx  NY  for the virtual Herbarium    200 000 for Dallas  TX  for the Women s Museum    200 000 for the Italian American Cultural Center of Iowa in Des Moines    250 000 for the James K  Polk Association in Columbia  TN  for exhibit preparation    100 000 for the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art Museum    500 000 for the Southwest Museum of the American Indian in Los Angeles  CA    100 000 for the Warner Robbins Museum of Aviation in Georgia    200 000 for the Texas Historical Commission    600 000 for the Vermont Department of Labor for Job Training of Female Inmates in Vermont    2 4 million for Maui Community College for the Remote Rural Hawaii Job Training Project    1 8 million for Maui Community College for training and educational opportunities    750 000 for Minot State University to provide training and masters degrees to job corp center senior management personnel     250 000 for the United Auto Workers Region 9 Training Initiative in New York    900 000 for the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation in Austin  TX  for the Presidential Timeline Project    1 1 million for the Billings Clinic  Billings  MT  Interestingly  the Billings clinic only has 272 beds in its hospital  and received recently an endowment of over  1 million for its cancer center      5 9 million for Marshall University  WV  including  1 575 000 for the AVirtual Colonoscopy Outreach Program     3 600 000 for Mountain State University  Beckley  WV  for the construction of the Allied Health Technology Tower    3 150 000 for West Virginia University  for the construction and equipping of medical simulation research and training centers    4 050 000 for West Virginia University  for the construction of a Multiple Sclerosis Center    1 000 000 for Wetzel County Hospital  WV  for the expansion and remolding of the Emergency Department    2 000 000 for the Iowa Department of Public Health to continue the Harkin Wellness Grant program  and   100 000 for Iowa Games  Ames  IA  to continue the Lighten Up Iowa program   Mr  President  I could go on and on calling out earmarks in this bill and its accompanying report  We are doing a disservice to the American taxpayers and ourselves by approving such wasteful spending  It doesn t have to be this way  In fact  for the past two fiscal years  the programs funded through the Labor  HHS bill were virtually pork free  A fortunate disagreement resulted in almost no earmarks in the FY 2006 bill  which had about 3 000 earmarks the prior year  And last year  we funded the programs with a Continuing Resolution that  for the taxpayers  turned out to have been about the most fiscally responsible route that we could have taken   I urge my colleagues to reject the excessive spending in this bill                                                October 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
