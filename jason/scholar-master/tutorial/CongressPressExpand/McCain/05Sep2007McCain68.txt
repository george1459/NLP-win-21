PETRAEUS AND AMBASSADOR CROCKER McCain  The choices we make now    will affect the security of all countrymen for decades to come  September 11  2007 WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today spoke at the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  The following remarks were prepared for delivery  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and welcome to our two distinguished witnesses  With your testimony  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  a debate of historic proportions begins in the United States Congress  The choices we make now  whether to build on the success of the surge and fight for additional gains  or whether to set a date for American surrender in   Iraq  will affect the security of all our countrymen for decades to come  As we all know  the American people are saddened  frustrated  and angry over our past failures in   Iraq   I  too  have been made sick at heart by the terrible price we have paid for nearly four years of mismanaged war  Some of us from the beginning warned against the Rumsfeld strategy of too few troops  insufficient resources  and a plan predicated on hope rather than on the difficult business of stabilization and counterinsurgency  We lost years to that strategy  and we lost that which is most precious to us  the lives of the brave men and women who fight on our behalf  But the question today is not whether we can recover those four years  we cannot  but whether we end this effort in frustration and accept thereby the terrible consequences that will ensue  I believe we cannot choose to lose in Iraq  and I will fight to ensure that our commanders in   Iraq have the time and support they request to win this war  The distinguished strategist Ralph Peters summed up the state of affairs well in a column today  noting that Congress failure to support General Petraeus would be a shame  since  after nearly four years of getting it miserably wrong in Iraq  were finally getting it right  We are getting it right because we finally have in place a strategy that can succeed  a counterinsurgency strategy  which some of us have argued we should have been following from the beginning  and which makes the most effective use of our strength and does not strengthen the tactics of our enemy  We must  as General Petraeus intends  keep this strategy in place  it is the only approach that has resulted in real security improvements in   Iraq  Anyone who has traveled recently to Anbar  or to Diyala  or Yusufiya  or to   Baghdad can see the improvements that have taken place over the past months  As our witnesses will testify  violence is down  commerce is on the rise  and the bottom up efforts to forge counterterrorism alliances are bearing tangible fruit  There are many challenges remaining  and the road ahead is long and tough  The Maliki government has not seized the opportunity presented by our efforts to move ahead with reconciliation and is not functioning as it must  Violence  having declined significantly  remains high and  as Ambassador Crocker has noted  no one can be certain of success  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Congress succeed in legislating a date for withdrawal  and thus surrender  then we will fail for certain  Make no mistake  the consequences of American defeat in   Iraq will be terrible and long lasting  There is in some corners a belief that we can simply turn the page in   Iraq   come home  and move on to other things  This is dangerously wrong  If we surrender in Iraq  we will be back  in   Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure  Last week  General Jim Jones testified before this committee and outlined what he believes to be the consequences of such a course        a precipitous departure which results in a failed state in Iraq  he said  will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists  jihadists       in the world  who will believe that they will have toppled the major power on Earth and that all else is possible  And I think it will not only make us less safe  it will make our friends and allies less safe  And the struggle will continue  It will simply be done in different and in other areas  Some senators would like to withdraw our troops from   Iraq so we can get back to fighting what they believe to be the real war on terror  which is taking place somewhere else  This  too  is inaccurate  Iraq has become the central front in the global war on terror  and failure there would turn Iraq into a terrorist sanctuary  in the heart of the Middle East  a host for jihadists planning attacks on   America   The region could easily descend into chaos  wider war  and genocide  and we should have no doubt about who will take advantage  The Iranian president has stated his intentions bluntly  saying  Soon  we will see a huge power vacuum in the region  Of course  we are prepared to fill the gap  We cannot allow an Iranian dominated    Middle East to take shape in the context of wider war and terrorist safehavens  All of us want our troops to come home  but we should want them to return to us with honor  the honor of victory that is due all of those who have paid with the ultimate sacrifice  General Petraeus and his troops ask just two things of us  the time to continue this strategy and the support they need to carry out their mission  They must have both  and I will fight to ensure that they do  Soon this debate will move from hearing rooms to the Senate floor where we will see  again  attempts to legislate a withdrawal from   Iraq   Given the enormous human and strategic costs such a defeat would impose on Iraq  the region  and Americans for years to come  Congress must not choose to lose in   Iraq   I will do all in my power to ensure that we do not  Thank you                                            September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
