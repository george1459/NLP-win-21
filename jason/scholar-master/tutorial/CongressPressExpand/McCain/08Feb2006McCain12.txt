                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON EARMARK REFORM BEFORE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE February 8  2006 Washington D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  testified today before the to Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for its hearing to Examine Procedures to Make the Legislative Process More Transparent  The following prepared statement was submitted for the record   Let me begin by commending the Chairman of the Rules Committee  Senator Lott  for holding today s hearing on one of the key components that must be addressed if our efforts to address comprehensive lobbying reform are to be effective and that is  earmark reform  This is the second hearing on this subject held by this Committee in the last two Congresses  and I commend the committee members for their attention to this issue of growing concern   You may recall the earmark growth charts I showed the Committee during a July 2003 hearing which illustrated the findings of the Congressional Research Service  showing the enormous growth in earmarks since 1994  Well  I am sad to report those numbers are even more alarming today    Refer to updated Charts   In 1994  there were 4 126 earmarks  In 2005  there were 15 877  the largest number yet   That s an increase of nearly 300 percent  The level of funding associated with those earmarks has more than doubled from  23 2 billion in FY 1994 to  47 4 billion in FY 2005  I ask that a copy of the report prepared by CRS be made a part of the hearing record   The focus of the July 2003 hearing was a rules change proposal I had introduced to allow points of order to be raised against unauthorized appropriations and policy riders in appropriations bills and conference reports in an effort to reign in wasteful pork barrel spending  Tomorrow I will introduce a modified version of that proposal  I will be joined in this bipartisan effort by Senators Feingold  Coburn  Bayh  Sununu  Graham  Ensign  DeMint  and Kyl   Our bill  entitled the Pork Barrel Reduction Act  would establish a new procedure under Rule XVI  modeled in part after the Byrd Rule  which would allow a 60 vote point of order to be raised against specific provisions that contain unauthorized appropriations  including earmarks  as well as unauthorized policy changes in appropriations bills and conference reports  Of importance is that successful points of order would not kill a conference report  but the targeted provisions would be deemed removed from the conference report  and the measure would be sent back for concurrence by the House   To ensure that Members are given enough time to review appropriations bills  our proposal would also require that conference reports be available at least 48 hours prior to floor consideration  It also prohibits the consideration of a conference report if it includes matter outside the scope of conference   Additionally  our bill includes the provisions of S  1495  the Obligation of Funds Transparency Act  which Senator Coburn and I introduced last July  to prohibit Federal agencies from obligating funds for appropriations earmarks included only in congressional reports  which are unamendable   To promote transparency  our bill requires that any earmarks included in a bill be disclosed fully in the bill s accompanying report  along with the name of the Member who requested the earmark and its essential governmental purpose  Additionally  our bill would require recipients of federal dollars to disclose any amounts that the recipient expends on registered lobbyists   In summary  this proposed rules change  if adopted  would allow any member to raise a point of order in an effort to extract objectionable unauthorized provisions from the appropriations process  Our goal is to reform the current system by empowering all members with a tool to rid appropriations bills of unauthorized funds  pork barrel projects  and legislative policy riders and to provide greater public disclosure of the legislative process   I understand Chairman Lott and Senator Feinstein introduced a resolution that doesn t go quite as far as our proposal   it would only allow points of order against earmarks and provisions outside the scope of conference  There bill is a good step in the right direction  although I am concerned that it would not allow us to go after a host of egregious earmarks  Nonetheless  I am pleased they have embraced the general concept that we are suggesting  which is to enable objectionable earmarks to be removed from bills and more importantly  conference reports  in a manner that would remove any suspicions that we are attempting to kill the whole conference report   Examples  I would like to mention some specific examples of recent earmarks  many of which clearly do not belong in the measures that they were included   From the Defense Conference Report for FY

unprecedented language was inserted into the final bill to allow the U S  Air Force to lease 100 Boeing 767 commercial aircraft and convert them to tankers  The total cost to taxpayers  about  30 billion   However  Congress did not authorize these provisions in the Act  or in any other bill for that matter  In fact  the Senate Armed Services Committee was not even advised of this effort by the Air Force Secretary during consideration of the authorization measure  Moreover  these aircraft were not in the president s budget  the joint chiefs  unfunded priority list  or the pentagon s long range defense budget  Additionally  the purportedly compelling need for these aircraft  which the air force repeatedly cited for having taxpayers pay  6 billion more for leasing these tankers than they would if the air force simply bought them outright  was  and continues to be  wholly unsupported by any serious study or analysis of alternatives   Nonetheless  legislative language was again included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003 to modify the previous year s bill language on the Boeing 767 tankers  And  once again  the sweeping changes in procurement policy was made by the Appropriators without the input of the authorizing committee   Ultimately  it was discovered that the air force broke a number of federal budgetary and leasing rules  that the lease terms were fiscally irresponsible  that this deal would have set a horrible precedent for the procurement of major defense systems  and that folks at the air force conspired with Boeing to break the law to make this deal happen in the first instance  Mr  Chairman  with some people  as a result  not only losing their jobs  but also serving time in jail  I think everyone in this room knows what an egregious mistake this turned out to be    From Supplemental for War on Terror Conference Report  April 2005   A provision directing the Secretary of the Interior to analyze the viability of a sanctuary for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow in Rio Grande Valley  TX   A provision stating that the  40M set forth in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 for construction of a Port of Philadelphia marine cargo terminal  be used solely for the construction by and for a Philadelphia based company    From the FY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report   The conference report contained provisions which allow a subsidiary of the Malaysian owned  Norwegian Cruise Lines  the exclusive right to operate several large foreign built cruise vessels in the domestic cruise trade  This provides an unfair competitive advantage to a foreign company at the expense of all other cruise ship operators  and creates a de facto monopoly for Norwegian Cruise Lines in the Hawaii cruise trade  Interestingly  this provision stems from another earmark in 1998 that went awry   The FY 1998 Department of Defense Appropriation Bill granted a legal monopoly for American Classic Voyages to operate as the only U S  flagged operator among the Hawaiian islands  After receiving the monopoly  American Classic Voyages secured a  1 1 billion loan guarantee from the U S  Maritime Administration s  MARAD  Title XI loan guarantee program for the construction of two passenger vessels known as Project America  Project America s subsequent failure four years later resulted in the U S  Maritime Administration paying out over  187 3 million of the American taxpayers  money to cover the project s loan default  and recovering only  2 million from the sale of some of the construction materials and parts  It is one hull and miscellaneous parts from these never completed ships which cost the taxpayers nearly  200 million which are now going to be used in a foreign shipyard for building the Norwegian Cruise ships that will operate in Hawaii under this latest special interest provision   The conference report included an agriculture policy change to make catfish producers eligible for payments under the livestock compensation program  even though hog  poultry  and horse producers are not eligible   Despite the fact that the U S  Department of Agriculture had implemented new organic food standards after lengthy negotiations  language was added to the conference report to permit livestock producers to certify and label meat products as  organic  even if the animals had not been fed organic grain  Without any consideration or debate  this last minute rider was added to override these standards  Interestingly  a few months later  the Congress approved legislation as part of the War supplemental to repeal this provision and restore the prior organic food labeling standards   Obviously  I could go on and on and on citing examples of unauthorized earmarks and policy riders in appropriations bills  But I think you ve got the picture  And I hope that we have finally reached the point that we are going to do something to reform this very broken system of legislating   Closing  Our current economic situation and our vital national security concerns require that now  more than ever  we prioritize our federal spending  But our appropriations bills do not always put our national priorities first  The process is broken and it needs to be fixed   In his farewell address  President Dwight D  Eisenhower reflected on the spending he believed to be excessive  His words then are all the more powerful in today s out of control environment    As we peer into society s future   he said   we   you and I  and our government   must avoid the impulse to live only for today  plundering  for our own ease and convenience  the precious resources of tomorrow  We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage  We want democracy to survive for all generations to come  not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow    And yet  if we cannot change  if we will not change  we risk precisely that   becoming the insolvent phantom of tomorrow  I wonder what President Eisenhower would think of this mess  But  then  perhaps others have contemplated the same question  After all  the Defense Appropriations bill we passed in December included a  1 7 million earmark for a memorial on the National Mall that would honor none other than        Dwight D  Eisenhower   I thank
