                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN STATEMENT ON DETAINEE AMENDMENTS ON  1  THE ARMY FIELD MANUAL AND  2  CRUEL  INHUMANE  DEGRADING TREATMENT November 4  2005 The following is a statement delivered by Senator John McCain    Mr  President  I rise to offer an amendment that would  1  establish the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for the interrogation of Department of Defense detainees and  2  prohibit cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment of persons in the detention of the U S  government   Mr  President  this amendment is identical to the one added by a 90 9 vote to the Defense Department Appropriations bill  Because of the extraordinary support for this legislation and its importance to our men and women in uniform  it is imperative that these provisions remain on the appropriations measure  which is now in conference  While I am now offering this amendment to the authorization bill in order to preserve all legislative options  I expect no one to argue that these critical provisions should thus be struck from the appropriations bill   They should not be removed from the appropriations bill  they should stay on that  must pass  measure to ensure their earliest enactment into law  On that bill  the provisions won the votes of 46 Republican senators and 44 Democrats  In addition  I understand  a clear majority in the House supports these provisions  wants to see them remain intact  and wishes to have them remain on the appropriations measure  I commend Congressman Murtha for his leadership and efforts to date to offer a motion to instruct conferees to keep this amendment intact without modification  I would hope that no one seeks procedural maneuvers to thwart overwhelming majorities in both chambers   Let me be clear  Mr  President  a bicameral  bipartisan majority in support of this amendment will prevail  Even if the will of the majority is thwarted this month  if it is thwarted next month  it will not be denied indefinitely  If necessary  and I sincerely hope it is not  I and the co sponsors of this amendment will seek to add it to every piece of important legislation voted on in the Senate until the will of a substantial bipartisan majority in both houses of Congress prevails  Let no one doubt our determination   Mr  President  to fight terrorism we need intelligence  That much is obvious  What should also be obvious is that the intelligence we collect must be reliable and acquired humanely  under clear standards understood by all our fighting men and women  To do differently not only offends our values as Americans  but undermines our war effort  because abuse of prisoners harms  not helps  us in the war on terror  First  subjecting prisoners to abuse leads to bad intelligence  because under torture a detainee will tell his interrogator anything to make the pain stop  Second  mistreatment of our prisoners endangers U S  troops who might be captured by the enemy  if not in this war  then in the next  And third  prisoner abuses exact on us a terrible toll in the war of ideas  because inevitably these abuses become public  When they do  the cruel actions of a few darken the reputation of our country in the eyes of millions  American values should win against all others in any war of ideas  and we can t let prisoner abuse tarnish our image   And yet reports of detainee abuse continue to emerge  in large part because of confusion in the field as to what is permitted and what is not  This amendment would go a long way toward clearing up the confusion   Army Field Manual  The first part of this amendment would establish the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for the interrogation of Department of Defense detainees  The Army Field Manual and its various editions have served America well  through wars against both regular and irregular foes  It embodies the values Americans have embraced for generations  while preserving the ability of our interrogators to extract critical intelligence from ruthless foes  Never has this been more important than today  in the midst of the war on terror   This amendment would establish the Army Field Manual as the standard for interrogation of all detainees held in DOD custody  The Manual has been developed by the Executive Branch for its own uses  and a new edition  written to take into account the needs of the war on terror and with a new classified annex  is due to be issued soon  My amendment would not set the Field Manual in stone   it could be changed at any time   The advantage of setting a standard for interrogation based on the Field Manual is to cut down on the significant level of confusion that still exists with respect to which interrogation techniques are allowed  Confusion about the rules results in abuses in the field  We need a clear  simple  and consistent standard  and we have it in the Army Field Manual on Interrogation  That s not just my opinion  but that of many more distinguished military minds than mine  including General Colin Powell  General Joseph Hoar  General John Shalikashvili  RADM John Hutson  and RADM Don Guter   These and other distinguished officers believe that the abuses at Abu Ghraib  Guantanamo and elsewhere took place in part because our soldiers received ambiguous instructions  which in some cases authorized treatment that went beyond what the Field Manual allows  and that  had the Manual been followed across the board  we could have avoided the prisoner abuse scandal  Mr  President  wouldn t any of us do whatever we could to have prevented that  By enacting this amendment  our service members can follow the Manual consistently from now on  Our troops deserve no less   Cruel  Inhumane  Degrading Treatment  The second part of this amendment is a prohibition against cruel  inhumane  and degrading treatment  If that doesn t sound new  that s because it s not  the prohibition has been a longstanding principle in both law and policy in the United States  To mention just a few examples  this prohibition is contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  to which the U S  is a signatory  and the binding Convention Against Torture  negotiated by the Reagan administration and ratified by the Senate   Nevertheless  the administration has held that the prohibition does not legally apply to foreigners held overseas  They can  apparently  be treated inhumanely  This means that America is the only country in the world that asserts a legal right to engage in cruel and inhumane treatment  What this also means is that confusion about the rules becomes rampant again  With this simple amendment  we can restore clarity on a simple and fundamental question  Does America treat people inhumanely  My answer is no  and from all I ve seen  America s answer has always been no   I d note for my colleagues  consideration that the State of Israel  no stranger to terrorist attacks  has declared cruel  inhumane and degrading treatment illegal  In 1999 the Israeli Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision to this effect that contained words we may wish to reflect on today   A democratic  freedom loving society   the court wrote   does not accept that investigators use any means for the purpose of uncovering the truth  The rules pertaining to investigations are important to a democratic state  They reflect its character    Mr  President  let there be no question about America s character  In deciding these rules  each member of this body has a vital role  Under Article I  Section 8 of the U S  Constitution  the Congress has the responsibility for making  rules concerning captures on land and water   Not the executive branch  not the courts  but Congress  Our brave men and women in the field need clarity  America needs to show the world that the terrible photos and stories of prison abuse are a thing of the past  Let s step up to this responsibility and speak clearly on this critical issue   We should do it not because we wish to coddle terrorists  We should do it not because we view them as anything but evil and terrible  We should do it  Mr  President  because we are Americans  and because we hold ourselves to humane standards of treatment of people no matter how evil or terrible they may be  America stands for a moral mission  one of freedom and democracy and human rights at home and abroad  We are better than these terrorists  and we will we win  I have said it before but it bears repeating  The enemy we fight has no respect for human life or human rights  They don t deserve our sympathy  But this isn t about who they are  This is about who we are  These are the values that distinguish us from our enemies  and we can never  never allow our enemies to take those values away     end
