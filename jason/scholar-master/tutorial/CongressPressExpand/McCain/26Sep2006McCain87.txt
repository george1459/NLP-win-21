                                                                                                                         MCCAIN URGES FINAL PASSAGE OF THE MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT OF 2006 September 28  2006  Washington D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following remarks on the floor of the Senate regarding the Military Commissions Act of 2006  Mr  President  almost exactly three months ago  the Supreme Court decided the groundbreaking case of Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  In that case  a majority of the Court ruled that the military procedures used to try detainees held at Guantanamo Bay fell short of the standards of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions  The Court also determined that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to al Qaeda because our conflict with that terrorist organization is not of an international character  Some of my colleagues may disagree with the Courts decision  but  once issued  it became the law of the land   Unfortunately  the Hamdan decision left in its wake a void and uncertainty that Congress needed to address  and address quickly  in order to continue fighting the war on terrorism  The Military Commissions Act of 2006  I believe  allows us to do that in a way that protects our soldiers and other personnel fighting on the front lines and respects core American principles of justice  I would like to thank Senators Warner and Graham for their unceasing work on this bill  It is certainly one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Senate will consider this year  and it is imperative that Congress pass it as soon as possible   I would like to take a few moments to describe some of the key elements of this legislation   As is by now well known  Senators Warner  Graham  and I have resisted any redefinition or modification of our Nations obligations under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  We did so because we care deeply about legal protections for American fighting men and women  and about Americas moral standing in the world  More than 50 retired military general and flag officers expressed grave concern about redefining our Geneva obligations  including five former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  I would like to submit for the Record letters from General Colin Powell  General Jack Vessey  and General Hugh Shelton  and a letter signed by dozens of former officers  These men express one common view  that modifying the Geneva Conventions would be a terrible mistake  and would put our personnel at greater risk in this war and the next  If America is seen to be doing anything other than upholding the letter and spirit of the Conventions  it will be harder  not easier  to defeat our enemies  I am pleased that this legislation before the Senate does not amend  redefine  or modify the Geneva Conventions in any way  The Conventions are preserved intact   The bill does provide needed clarity for our personnel about what activities constitute war crimes  For the first time  there will be a list of nine specific activities that constitute criminal violations of Common Article 3  punishable by imprisonment or even death  There has been much public discussion about specific interrogation methods that may be prohibited  But it is unreasonable to suggest that any legislation could provide an explicit and all inclusive list of what specific activities are illegal and which are permitted  Still  I am confident that the categories included in this section will criminalize certain interrogation techniques  like waterboarding and other techniques that cause serious pain or suffering that need not be prolonged   Some critics of this legislation have asserted that it gives amnesty to U S  personnel who may have committed war crimes since the enactment of the War Crimes Act  Nothing could be further from the truth  As currently written  the War Crimes Act makes criminal any and all behavior that constitutes a violation of Common Article 3  specifically any act that constitutes an outrage upon personal dignity  Observers have commented that  though such outrages are difficult to define precisely  we all know them when we see them  However  neither I nor any other responsible member of this body should want to prosecute and potentially sentence to death any individual for violating such a vague standard   The specificity that the bill provides to the War Crimes Act  and its retroactive effect  will actually make prosecuting war criminals a realistic goal  None of my colleagues should object to that goal   It is also important to note that the acts that we propose to enumerate in the War Crimes Act are not the only activities prohibited under this legislation  The categories enumerated in the War Crimes Act list only those violations of Common Article 3 that are so grave as to constitute felonies potentially punishable by death  The legislation states explicitly that there are other  non grave breaches of Common Article 3   The Military Commissions Act also requires the President to publish his interpretations of the Geneva Conventions  including what violations constitute non grave breaches  in the Federal Register  These interpretations will have the same force as any other administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch  and thus may be trumped by law passed by Congress   Simply put  this legislation ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva  recognizes the Presidents constitutional authority to interpret treaties  and brings accountability and transparency to the process of interpretation by ensuring that the executives interpretation is made public  The legislation would also guarantee that Congress and the judicial branch will retain their traditional roles of oversight and review with respect to the Presidents interpretation of non grave breaches of Common Article 3   In short  whereas last year only one law  the torture statute  was deemed to apply to the treatment of all enemy detainees  now there is a set of overlapping and comprehensive legal standards that are in force  the Detainee Treatment Act  with its prohibition on cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment as defined by the 5th  8th  and 14th amendments to the Constitution  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  and the War Crimes Act   This legislation will allow the CIA to continue interrogating prisoners within the boundaries established in the bill  Let me state this flatly  it was never our purpose to prevent the CIA from detaining and interrogating terrorists  On the contrary  it is important to the war on terror that the CIA have the ability to do so  At the same time  the CIAs interrogation program has to abide by the rules  including the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act   I  like many of my colleagues  find troubling the reports that our intelligence personnel feel compelled to purchase liability insurance because of the lack of legal clarity that exists in the wake of the Hamdan decision  This legislation provides an affirmative defense for any government personnel prosecuted under the War Crimes Act for actions they reasonably believed to be legal at the time  In addition  it would eliminate any private right of action against our personnel based on a violation of the Geneva Conventions  The intent of this provision is to protect officers  employees  members of the Armed Forces  and other agents of the United States from suits for money damages or any other lawsuits that could harm the financial well being of our personnel who were engaged in lawful activities   It is important to note  however  that the fact that the Geneva Conventions lack a private right of action  and the fact that this legislation does not create such a right  has absolutely no bearing on whether the Conventions are binding on the Executive branch  Even if the Geneva Conventions do not enable detainees to sue our personnel for money damages  the President and his subordinates are nevertheless bound to comply with Geneva  That is clear to me and to all who have negotiated this legislation in good faith   This point is critical  because our personnel deserve not only the legal protections written into this legislation  but also the undiluted protections offered since 1949 by the Geneva Conventions  Should the United States be seen as amending  modifying  or redefining the Geneva Conventions  it would open the door for our adversaries to do the same  now and in the future  The United States should champion the Geneva Conventions  not look for ways to get around them  lest we invite others to do the same  America has more personnel deployed  in more places  than any other country in the world  and this unparalleled exposure only serves to further demonstrate the critical importance of our fulfilling the letter and the spirit of our international obligations  To do any differently would put our fighting men and women directly at risk  We owe it to our fighting men and women to uphold the Geneva Conventions  just as we have done for 57 years   For these reasons  this bill makes clear that the United States will fulfill all of its obligations under those Conventions  We expect the CIA to conduct interrogations in a manner that is fully consistent not only with the Detainee Treatment Act and the War Crimes Act  but with all of our obligations under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions   Finally  I would note that there has been opposition to this legislation from some quarters  including the New York Times editorial page  Without getting into a point by point rebuttal here on the floor  I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced  The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating  nor even at the Administrations original position  I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision  and pass no legislation at all  That  I suggest to my colleagues  would be a travesty   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation
