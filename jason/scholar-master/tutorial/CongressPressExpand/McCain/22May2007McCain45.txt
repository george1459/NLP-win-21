                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON THE FISCAL YEAR 2007 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT May 24  2007 Washington  D C    Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement on the Fiscal Year 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act       Mr  President  our servicemen and women on the front lines in the War on Terror have been waiting too long for the funding this bill provides  Our soldiers  airmen  and marines need this appropriation to carry out their vital work  and we should have provided it months ago  The Congress  which authorized the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  has an obligation to give our troops everything they need to prevail in their missions  As such  I will vote for its passage  But I do so with deep reservations  The legislation we are considering now is the wrong way to fund this war  and it fails the most basic tests imposed on us as stewards of taxpayer dollars        This emergency supplemental appropriations bill contains  120 billion in funding  approximately  17 billion above the President   s request  It is filled with billions of dollars in non emergency spending that has nothing to do with funding the troops  In a time of war  with large federal budget deficits  we should be constraining our federal expenditures  Sadly  we have chosen  once again  to do the opposite  and loaded this bill with billions of dollars in spending we don   t need  spending that was not requested  spending that will only add to the already excessive size of government        The President submitted his supplemental funding request on February 5th     nearly 4 months ago  The Senate finally passed a very flawed version of a bill on March 29th     a bill that everyone knew was nothing more than a political stunt  one that was dead before arrival to the President  Instead of putting our country first and providing the troops with full funding as expeditiously as possible  we let partisan politics rule the day  While some may believe that they scored political points by forcing meaningless procedural votes  I would ask them to reflect for a moment  What gain inheres in playing partisan politics with the lives of our honorable warriors and their families  How can we possibly find honor in using the fate of our servicemen to score political advantage in Washington  There is no pride to be had in such efforts  Mr  President  We are at war  a hard and challenging war  and we do no service for the best of us   those who fight and risk all on our behalf   by playing politics with their service      So now  nearly four months after the supplemental funding request was submitted  here we are  with money literally running out to fund this war  We are about to pass a bill that while better than the last version  still contains billions of dollars that have nothing to do with the War on Terror  We can do better than this  The American taxpayers deserve and expect more        As my colleagues know  I   ve been meeting with citizens across the country  and let me assure you  they are not happy with the workings of Congress  There is a reason that the poll results on Congress   s favorability rating are at such lows   the latest at 31 percent  It is because of partisan politics having a greater priority in Washington than doing the people   s business  It is because we are not making the tough choices to halt deficit spending and fix the out of control entitlement programs  It is because we seem to care more about our own reelections than about reforming government  This is not the way the American public wants their elected officials to behave  What will it take for that to sink in       Let me mention some of the un requested and un authorized items contained in this bill       110 million in aid to the shrimp and fisheries industries       11 million for flood control projects in New York and New Jersey       37 million to modernize the Farm Service Agency   s computer system       13 million for the Save America   s Treasures program  and       3 billion in agriculture disaster assistance  including  22 million to support the Department of Agriculture in implementing programs to provide this un requested and unauthorized funding       Mr  President  there are also several items in this bill that seek to legislate on an appropriations bill rather than allowing such items to move through the regular legislative process  Examples include language that      Raises the minimum wage      Restricts the Department of Transportation from implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement   s  NAFTA  provisions expanding cross border trade between Mexico and the United States with the introduction of a pilot program that would allow a select group of Mexican trucking companies to make deliveries into our country beyond the 25 miles that current law permits      Extends several tax credits  while setting forth new Internal Revenue Service definitions and exempting some programs from taxation  and       Amends the Food Security Act to make adjustments to the Department of Agriculture   s land and soil conservation program       Another provision that seeks to legislate on this appropriations bill is a provision that would end run the Defense Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  process  The 2005 BRAC commission decided to close the Naval Air Station at Willow Grove  Pennsylvania  and the Department of Navy was in the process of closing the base in accordance with the law  This bill  however  would transfer the land and facilities to the Air Force     even though the Secretary of the Air Force stated on April 12  2007 that there is not a military need for the land it will be forced to receive  This provision was not requested by the Administration  is not an emergency  and is not a responsible way to legislate  It was not reviewed or debated in any committee  and the committee of jurisdiction has had no say in the matter  Yet  the American people will now be forced to continue to pay for the maintenance of this unwanted land when the Air Force receives it       Despite these unacceptable earmarks and legislative language  I am pleased that this bill does not contain a timeline for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq  regardless of the conditions there  Such a mandate would have had grave consequences for the future of Iraq and the security of Americans  The President was right to veto the first iteration of this legislation      I do have concerns  however  with the way in which this measure conditions aid to the Iraqi government by requiring the government to meet benchmarks  Although I support benchmarks for the Iraqi government  and I believe that we should encourage the Iraqi government to move ahead as rapidly as possible on a number of fronts  some of the benchmarks contained in this bill are beyond the control of the Iraqi leadership  One of the benchmarks  for example  mandates that there will be no safe haven for    any outlaws     This should of course be an aspiration  but if terrorists or insurgents hang on and hole up in Baghdad  should this constitute a reason why the United States withholds economic aid to the government  Similarly  another benchmark requires the Iraqi government to reduce the level of sectarian violence  But if sectarian violence does not decline as rapidly as we would like  does this suggest that the answer is to cut off reconstruction aid  It   s not at all clear to me that it does       I believe that  instead of legislating a list of benchmarks that must be met by the Iraqis  and imposing statutory penalties for non performance  it would be preferable for the administration to reach agreement on a series of benchmarks with the Iraqi government  a timeline for implementation  and consequences attached to each  Such an approach would make clear to the Iraqis that they must make progress  but would do so in a way that is specific  flexible  and realistic       Mr  President  if this bill is to have benchmarks at all  it should be a benchmark that Congress may not approve any earmark  no matter how valid the cause  without an authorization  an Administration request or inclusion in the budget  The national debt grows  75 million dollars an hour and  1 3 billion dollars a day  Congress should benchmark its spending sprees on zero debt  but it won   t  This body would rather set benchmarks for others around the world than take responsibility for its own actions  For these reasons  this bill is flawed and irresponsible  but I will vote for it nonetheless in order to support our brave men and women fighting for freedom in
