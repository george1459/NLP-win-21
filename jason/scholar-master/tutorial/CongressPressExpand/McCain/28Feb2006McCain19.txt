                                                                                                                         HEARING ON SECURITY OF TERMINAL OPERATIONS AT U S  PORTS February 28  2006  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this hearing about the proposed transfer of terminal operations from the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company to Dubai Ports World  It is my hope that over the next 45 days  Congress and the public will keep an open mind while learning the facts of the transaction and not succumb to the hysteria that has been promoted by some    A lot has been said and written in the past week about this transaction  but thus far I have found nothing that leads me to believe that it would negatively impact our nation s port security  Regardless of who operates any particular terminal  the Coast Guard will still control physical security and the Customs and Border Patrol will still control container security at our ports  The local port authority and the local police will still assist these federal agencies with security  The longshoremen who move the cargo after the deal will be the same American workers who move the cargo today    One more thing won t change  Foreign operators  including some owned or controlled by foreign governments  will continue to manage about 80 percent of port terminals in the United States  companies from the United Kingdom  Denmark  Hong Kong  Japan  South Korea  Singapore  China  and Taiwan  just as U S  companies will continue to manage terminals in foreign countries  So  the issue here seems to be less about foreign operation of our nation s seaport terminals and more about the home country of DP World    The United Arab Emirates  UAE  has provided U S  and Coalition military forces unprecedented access to its ports and territory  overflight clearances  and other critical and important logistical assistance  The UAE has played host to over 700 U S  Navy ships at its ports  including the Port of Jebel Ali  which is managed by DP World  and to the U S  Air Force at al Dhafra Air Base  The country also hosts the UAE Air Warfare Center  the leading fighter training center in the Middle East  The UAE has worked with us to stop terrorist financing and money laundering  Moreover  Dubai was the first Middle Eastern entity to join the Container Security Initiative and the Department of Energy s Megaports Initiative  a program aimed at stopping illicit shipments of nuclear and other radioactive material    The Washington Post aptly editorialized  A goal of  democracy promotion  in the Middle East  after all  is to encourage Arab countries to become economically and politically integrated with the rest of the world  What better way to do so than by encouraging Arab companies to invest in the United States  The shipping industry in a multi national industry where some of the best run terminals at American ports are managed by foreign companies  Let s think about the message we send to the Arab and Muslim world by opposing this transaction  The war on terror is a battle of ideas as much as it is one of weapons  and one of the ideas that I would hope we would hold onto dearly is that America is not anti Muslim or anti Arab  Yet I fear that if we block this deal after allowing so many others to go forward  that is exactly how we will be perceived                                                       February 2006 Press Releases           Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                              Current record
