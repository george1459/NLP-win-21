                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2006 May 25  2006  Washington D C    Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on the floor of the U S  Senate regarding the final passage of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006    Mr  President  after several weeks of extensive debate and consideration of numerous and complicated amendments  the Senate is about to move to final passage on S  2611  the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act  This legislation addresses comprehensively one of the most important and complex issues facing our country  Our nation s immigration system is broken  I don t think there was one member of the United States Senate to argue that fact  Without enactment of comprehensive immigration reform as provided for under this bill  our nation s security will remain vulnerable  That is why we must pass this bill  and reach a meaningful final product through conference deliberations  Our failure to produce a final comprehensive measure is an unacceptable proposition    I want to first thank the President for his leadership on this issue  The President s speech to the Nation last week  which I thought was inspired  was greeted by 74 percent of the American people overnight favorably  including his absolute determination to see the Congress of the United States send him a bill which has a comprehensive approach to this issue which we as a Congress and a Federal Government have ignored for too long    I also commend the Senate Leadership on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to ensure that the Senate addressed this important issue and gave us more than adequate time for a thorough debate  This is a proud moment for the United States Senate  as we have conducted good work and returned to orderly traditions of the legislative process as envisioned by our founding fathers    I also want to again recognize Chairman Specter for his work in leading us to this point in the legislative process  He and all of the members of the Judiciary Committee deserve our appreciation for the considerable effort they have taken on this issue during this Congress    And of course  I commend Senator Kennedy  who is perhaps the leading expert on this difficult issue  He and I spent many months working to develop a comprehensive  reasonable  workable legislative proposal  much of which is contained in the bill before us  I also want to thank Senators Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  Salazar  Martinez  Obama  and Dewine for their shared commitment to this issue  and working to ensure this bill moved successfully intact through the legislative process    Mr  President  throughout this debate  we were reminded that immigration is a national security issue  and it is  It is also a matter of life and death for many living along the border  We have hundreds of people flowing across our borders every day  coming here only in search of better lives for themselves and their families  They come to fill the vacant jobs at businesses and farms that struggle with real labor shortages that impact negatively our economy    This Nation is calling for our borders to be secured and for an overhaul of our immigration system  and that it be done in a humane and comprehensive fashion  Vote after vote after vote taken in this body reaffirms that fact    The new policies as provided for under this legislation will increase border security and provide for a new  temporary worker program to enable foreign workers to work legally in this country when there are jobs that American workers won t fill  And  it will acknowledge and address in a humanitarian and compassionate way the current undocumented population   As many have noted  Mr  President  there are over 11 million people in America today who came here illegally  They live in our cities and towns and rural communities  They harvest our crops  tend our gardens  work in our restaurants and clean our houses  They came  as others before them came  to grasp the lowest rung of the American ladder of opportunity  to work the jobs others won t  and by virtue of their own industry and dreams  to rise and build better lives for their families and a better America    Some Americans believe we must find all these millions  round them up and send them back to the countries they came from  I don t know how you do that  And I don t know why you would want to    Yes  in this post 9 11 era  America must enforce its borders  There are people who wish to come here to do us harm  and we must vigilantly guard against them  spend whatever it takes  devote as much manpower to the task as necessary  But we must also find some way to separate those who have come here for the same reasons every immigrant has come here from those who are driven here by their hate for us and our ideals  We must concentrate our resources on the latter and persuade the former to come out from the shadows  We won t be able to persuade them if all we offer is a guarded escort back to the place of hopelessness and injustice that they had fled    Why not say to those undocumented workers who are working the jobs that the rest of us refuse  come out from the shadows  earn your citizenship in this country  You broke the law to come here  so you must go to the back of the line  pay a fine  stay employed  learn our language  pay your taxes  obey our laws  and earn the right to be an American    Riayen Tejada immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic  He came with two dreams  he said  to become an American citizen and to serve in the United States Marine Corps  He willingly accepted the obligations of American citizenship before he possessed all the rights of an American  Staff Sergeant Tejada  from Washington Heights by way of the Dominican Republic  the father of two young daughters  died in an ambush in Baghdad on May 14  2004  He had never fulfilled his first dream to become a naturalized American citizen  But he loved this country so much that he gave his life to defend her  Right now  at this very moment  there are fighting for us in Iraq and Afghanistan  soldiers whose parents are not yet American citizens but who have dreamed the dream that their sons and daughters risk their lives to defend  They should make us proud to be Americans    These people have come for the same reason immigrants have always come to America  They came to grasp the lowest rung of the ladder  and they intend to rise  Let them rise  Let them rise  We will be better for it  For America  blessed  bountiful  beautiful America  is still the land of hope and opportunity  the land of the immigrant s dreams  Long may she remain so                                                     May 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
