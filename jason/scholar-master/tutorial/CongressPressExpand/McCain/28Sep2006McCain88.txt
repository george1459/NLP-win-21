                                                                                                                         MCCAIN COMMENTS ON CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE 2007 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT September 29  2006     Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following remarks on the floor of the Senate regarding the Conference Report on the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act  Mr  President  today we are considering the Conference Report on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007  The funding provided in this legislation is crucial for the ongoing war on terror  It is imperative that critical resources continue to be provided for the brave men and women who have answered their nations call  It is our duty to support those who defend our freedom and for that reason I will vote in favor of this legislation  However  while I will support passage  I note with concern the billions of dollars in wasteful earmarks that have again found their way into both the conference report and the joint explanatory statement   Of equal importance to the legislation we are considering today is the National Defense Authorization Act for 2007  I am encouraged by last nights report that an agreement has been reached between Chairman Warner and Chairman Hunter  With bipartisan cooperation  I am confident that the Conference Report will be filed soon and its final passage can be achieved before we leave this week  It is a matter of national security and imperative in fulfilling our duty to defend the nation   An important provision contained in the Senate passed Defense Authorization Act would require regular budgeting for the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  It is necessary because even though we have been fighting the War on Terror for nearly five years  we continue to fund it through emergency supplemental spending bills that have become the rule  rather than the exception as would be expected for unanticipated expenditures  Fortunately  the provision to require budgeting for the war was adopted by a vote of 98 to 0  and I am very hopeful that this important budgetary requirement will remain intact in the Conference Report  The next budget submission will be expected to include funding to conduct the ongoing conflict for the next year   The Appropriations Conference Report before us today appropriates over  447 billion dollars for the Department of Defense  While this is considerable funding  it is more than  4 billion below what the President requested  Not only does this legislation provide less than the President s request  but many of the Presidents programs have been stripped out and replaced with earmarks for favored projects  These are serious times that require serious people to make serious decisions  tough decisions that may go against the special interests  I need not remind my colleagues that we are at war  Supporting the President s budget and the troops it sustains should be our primary focus  not parochial interests   The issues we face as a nation require all of us to make sacrifices  The servicemembers who defend our nation s interests around the globe are making great sacrifices  The families who wait for them back home are making sacrifices  Because we ask these heroes to forfeit so much  we in the Congress should also be ready to make sacrifices  By doing so  a message can be sent that our nations security and the welfare of our service members are higher priorities than earmarks inserted to gain favor from special interests or the opportunity to send out a press release touting the bacon we are bringing home   Mr  President  the practice of earmarking has reached epic proportions and the harm it has caused in some cases has been clearly exposed  In the last two years alone weve had ample evidence of the corrupting influence of these earmarks on the Congress  It is clear that they detract from the trust and confidence the American taxpayer has placed in their elected officials  How high will we let the federal deficit climb before we take our fiscal responsibilities seriously  What is it going to take for us to finally say  enough is enough  We should pass a Defense Appropriations Bill which mirrors the Authorization Bill and fulfills the requirements of our military as requested by the President   The American taxpayer has a right to expect us to get the most out of each and every defense dollar  especially at a time when those dollars are so critical  The money that is being diverted to unauthorized projects should instead be used to address the needs of our services  It is the service chiefs who are in the best position to advise Congress of their priorities  Unauthorized earmarks drain our precious resources and adversely affect our national security   Here is a sampling of non defense related earmarks in the Conference Report or the Joint Explanatory Statement we are considering   12 8 million for Alaska Land Mobile Radio   4 million for the Northern Line Extension of the Alaska Railroad   1 4 million for the South Carolina Center for Excellence in Educational Technology   10 million for the Port of Anchorage Intermodal Marine Facility Project  and  3 2 million for the Lewis Center for Educational Research  which houses a school and science center  but no known military application   One of the more egregious add ons in the legislation currently on the floor is the addition of over  2 billion for ten C 17 cargo planes that were not requested by the Administration  The Air Force is not asking for these additional C 17s and the Quadrennial Defense Review clearly states a need for a total of only 180 aircraft  Why are ten additional aircraft now part of a bridge fund that is designed to provide necessary resources for our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  Another reason I find this add on particularly objectionable is that going into conference  the House had approved only three additional C 17s and the Senate had approved only two  At a minimum  seven additional C 17 aircraft were added by the conferees and that was outside of the matter they were tasked to resolve  I simply find this to be outrageous  The practice of adding unrequested  unauthorized and unneeded projects onto war time spending bills must be put to an end   Other unrequested earmarks include   117 million for T AGS Oceanographic Survey Ships   60 million for Weapons Industrial Facilities Equipment   10 million for Earthmoving Scrapers   12 7 million for Aircraft Weapons Range Support Equipment   10 6 million for Other Aircraft in the Air Force Procurement Category   22 5 million for Human Factors Engineering Technology   1 3 million for the RAND Arroyo Center   14 9 million for Industrial Preparedness  and  44 5 million for the Maui Space Surveillance System   This list goes on and on  In fact  there are hundreds of such add ons that total over  5 billion  I am not arguing that some of these earmarks could be used for good causes  But I do protest the process by which Congress ignores priorities of the armed services so that they can deliver federal tax dollars for local programs  some of which have nothing to do with the defense of our nation   Mr  President  I am also concerned about our restrictive trade policies and the potentially negative impact they have on our readiness and interoperability with our allies  Every year  so called Buy America restrictions cost the Department of Defense and the American taxpayers billions  I oppose these types of protectionist policies and economically they just don t make sense  Free trade improves relations between nations and promotes economic growth  Buy America restrictions could seriously impair our ability to compete freely in international markets and risks existing business from our long standing trade partners and allies   This Conference Report includes language to prohibit the procurement of foreign carbon or steel armor plate  ball and roller bearings  ship cranes and propellers  These Buy America restrictions may cost the taxpayers more than purchasing the same items on the international market  and by imposing them  we risk denying our warfighters the best available technology  Though I oppose these protectionist provisions  I appreciate that the Conferees have provided for appropriate waivers based on case by case certifications  But these are really issues of acquisition policy  not appropriations matters  and should be addressed during the defense authorization process  Let s leave the authorizing of acquisition policy to the authorizers and debate these types of issues on authorization bills   Mr  President  the appropriations measure before us is critical to our fight against terror  Ideally  I would not need to criticize this legislation  but we owe it to the American taxpayer to inform them of how their money is being spent  I yield the floor                                             September 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
