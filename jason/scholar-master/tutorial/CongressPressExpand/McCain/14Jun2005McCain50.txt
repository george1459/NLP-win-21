                                                                                                                         INTRODUCTION OF THE SAVE LIVES ACT OF 2005 June 14  2005  Mr  President  I rise today to introduce a bill to support the Nation s finest  our police  fire fighters and other emergency response personnel  The  Spectrum Availability for Emergency response and Law enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency Services Act   otherwise known as  The SAVE LIVES Act   This bill is drafted in response to the 9 11 Commission s Final Report  which recommended the  expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes     To meet this recommendation  the SAVE LIVES Act would set a date certain for the allocation of spectrum to public safety agencies  specifically the 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band that Congress promised public safety agencies in 1997  This is a promise Congress has yet to deliver to our Nation s first responders  Now is the time for Congressional action before another national emergency or crisis takes place  Access to this specific spectrum is essential to our Nation s safety and welfare as emergency communications sent over these frequencies are able to penetrate walls and travel great distances  and can assist multiple jurisdictions in deploying interoperable communications systems    In addition to setting a date certain  this bill would authorize funds for public safety agencies to purchase emergency communications equipment and ensure that Congress has the ability to consider whether additional spectrum should be provided for public safety communications prior to the recovered spectrum being auctioned  The bill contains significant language concerning consumer education of the digital television transition  The bill would mandate that warning labels be displayed on analog television sets sold prior to the transition  require warning language to be displayed at television retailers  command the distribution at retailers of brochures describing the television set options available  and call on broadcasters to air informational programs to better prepare consumers for the digital transition    The bill would ensure that no television viewer s set would go  dark  by providing digital to analog converter boxes to over the air viewers that have a household income that does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line and by allowing cable companies to down convert digital signal signals if necessary  I continue to believe that broadcast television is a powerful communications tool and important information source for citizens  I know that on 9 11  I learned about the attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon like most Americans   by watching television  Therefore  this bill seeks to not only protect citizens  safety  but also the distribution of broadcast television    Lastly  the bill would establish a tax credit for the recycling of television sets and require the Environmental Protection Agency to report to Congress on the need for a national electronic waste recycling program    The 9 11 Commission s Final Report contained harrowing tales about police officers and fire fighters who were inside the Twin Towers and unable to receive evacuation orders over their radios from commanders  In fact  the report found that this inability to communicate was not only a problem for public safety organizations responding at the World Trade Center  but also for those responding at the Pentagon and Somerset County  Pennsylvania crash sites where multiple organizations and multiple jurisdictions responded  Therefore  the Commission recommended that Congress accelerate the availability of more spectrum for public safety    The SAVE LIVES Act would implement the important recommendation and ensure that WHEN our Nation experiences another attack  or other critical emergencies occur  our police  fire fighters and other emergency response personnel will have the ability to communicate with each other and their commanders to prevent another catastrophic loss of life  Now is the time for Congressional action before another national emergency or crisis takes place    Several lawmakers attempted to act last year during the debate on the Intelligence Reform bill  but our efforts were thwarted by the powerful National Association of Broadcasters  This year  I hope we call all work together and to pass a bill that ensures the country is not only better prepared in case of another attack  but also protects the vital communications outlet of broadcast television  I believe the SAVE LIVES Act does just that    Mr  President  in an effort to expediously retrieve the spectrum for the Nation s first responders  to preserve over the air television accessibility to consumers and to ensure the adequate funding of both  I urge the enactment of The SAVE LIVES Act                                                   June 2005 Press Releases
