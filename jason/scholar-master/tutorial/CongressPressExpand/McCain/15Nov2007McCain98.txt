                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON    BRIDGE FUND    November 16  2007 WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today condemned the Bridge Fund in remarks submitted for the Congressional Record    The statement reads   Mr  President  I oppose H R  4156  a bill that would link vital funding for our troops to a mandated timeline for withdrawal from Iraq  Not only is this bill irresponsive to the facts on the ground  it is irresponsible  Instead  we should approve S  2340 and provide our military with the resources they require  free of conditions that would undermine their ability to conduct operations and build on their recent successes    Today the Senate considers yet another bill mandating the withdrawal of U S  combat forces from Iraq  regardless of conditions on the ground or the views of our commanders in the field  If this latest attempt sounds familiar  it should  the majority has thus far engaged in no less than 40 legislative attempts to limit the ability of the President and his commanders to prosecute this war  And  just like the 40 votes that preceded this one  the result of this vote will undoubtedly be the same  The proponents of this legislation are well aware of this fact  and the fact that the President has pledged to veto legislation calling for a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  Rather than move beyond these differences and ensure that our troops in the field receive the vital funding they need  however  we will go through this exercise yet again    This legislation would mandate a withdrawal of U S  combat forces within 30 days of enactment  leaving a smaller force authorized only to carry out narrowly defined missions  with the goal of ending our involvement  irrespective of the situation in Iraq  by December 15 of next year  Given that similar provisions have failed 40 times already  it is inconceivable that they would succeed now  when there is unambiguous progress in Iraq  The choice today is simple  do we build upon the clear successes of our current strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his command the support they require to complete their mission  or do we ignore the realities and legislate a premature end to our efforts in Iraq  accepting thereby all the terrible consequences that will ensue  The answer  Mr  President  should be simple    As we proceed with consideration of this bill  it is important to spend a few moments reviewing the current state of affairs in Iraq  We see today that  after nearly four years of mismanaged war  the situation on the ground in Iraq shows tangible signs of progress  The forces needed to implement General Petraeus counter insurgency plan have been in place for over six months and our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  continues to make significant gains in a number of areas    The second in command in Iraq  Lt  General Ray Odierno  stated earlier this month that due to the recently implemented counterinsurgency operations  we have been able to eliminate key safe havens  liberate portions of the population and hamper the enemys ability to conduct coordinated attacks  General Odierno went on to add that we have experienced a consistent and steady trend of increased security over the last four months  and I believe continued aggressive operations by both Iraqi and coalition forces are the most effective way to extend our gains and continue to protect the citizens of Iraq  According to a recent report issued by the Department of Defense  weekly IED attacks have decreased by 60  across Iraq since the beginning of Operation Phantom Thunder in mid June   The Associated Press reports that Iraqi civilian deaths have dropped sharply as a result of the surge  from 1 791 in August to 750 in October  Mortar attacks by insurgents in October were the lowest on record since February of 2006  as were the number of indirect fire attacks on U S  and coalition forces  The surges success in establishing greater security has spurred a great increase in cooperation from Iraqi citizens  and Major General Rick Lynch  commander of U S  forces south of Baghdad  said he believes the decrease in rocket and mortar attacks will continue to hold because of a groundswell of support from regular Iraqis  If we didnt have so many people coming forward to help  Id think  the decrease in attacks  is a flash in the pan  But thats just not the case  General Lynch said    We are all aware of the monumental strides our military has made in restoring order and reducing violence in Anbar Province  A province once declared lost to al Qaeda has begun a return to normalcy for many of its inhabitants  Locals  sickened by the brutality of insurgents and terrorists  have rejected violent extremism and have cooperated with U S  and Iraqi forces to take the fight to the enemy  This partnership model combined with U S  troops living forward is being replicated and producing real results all across the country    In Ghazaliya  for example  once known as a strategic gateway to Baghdad for insurgents and a place where coalition convoys were regularly ambushed  the creation of Joint Security Stations has led to a significant reduction in sectarian violence and IED attacks  Amariyah  a neighborhood in western Baghdad that just six months ago was a central operational location for al Qaeda in Iraq and plagued by high levels of bombings and shootings  is beginning to see a drastic reduction in violence and many residents are beginning to experience some semblance of normal life    None of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have suddenly become safe  or that violence has come down to an acceptable level  or that victory lies just around the corner  On the contrary  the road ahead remains  as it always has been  long and hard  Violence is still at unacceptable levels in some parts of the country  reconstruction of important infrastructure lags  and the Maliki government remains unwilling to function as it must  No one can guarantee success or be certain about its prospects  but  by the same token  no one should dismiss the positive developments that have resulted from this new strategy in Iraq    Nor can we dismiss the enormous costs of American failure in Iraq  Many of my colleagues would like to believe that  should the bill we are currently considering become law  it would mark the end of this long effort  They are wrong  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement  If we leave  we will be back  in Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure  Now is not the time for us to lose our resolve  We must remain steadfast in our mission  for we do not fight only for the interests of Iraqis  Mr  President  we fight for ours as well    That means approving the support that our fighting men and women need  The funding contained in this supplemental is not  as some have characterized it  the Presidents money  This money is for the troops  This funding is to provide them with the equipment and proper training they require to fulfill their mission  funding to protect our men and women from roadside bombs and other attacks  funding to enable them to bring this war to a successful end  Holding our militarys funding hostage to a repetitive and futile attempt to score political points is unconscionable   Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England recently wrote to the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee about the effects of this legislation  Without this critical funding  he wrote  the Department will have no choice but to deplete key appropriations accounts by early next year  In particular  the Armys Operation and Maintenance account will be completely exhausted in mid to late January  This situation will result in a profoundly negative impact on the defense civilian workforce  depot maintenance  base operations  and training activities  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said just yesterday that  should the money contained in this bill be withheld  he will have to lay off 200 000 civilian employees and contractors  terminate military contracts and partially shut down U S  military bases  Army Secretary Pete Green went on to add that without these funds  the negative effects will fall most heavily onhome based troops and their families   Mr  President  Ive seen a lot during my time in the United States Senate  but few events sink to the level of what we are witnessing today  I understand the frustration that many feel after nearly four years of mismanaged war  I share their frustration and sadness  But we must remember to whom we owe our allegiance  Not to short term political gain  but to the security of America  to those brave men and women who risk all to ensure it  and to the ideals upon which our nation was founded  That responsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged by history to have discharged it honorably will  in the end  matter so much more to all of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim  electoral advantage or office  Let us not sacrifice the remarkable gains our servicemen and women have made by engaging in a game of political brinksmanship  There is far too much at stake   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill                                             November 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
