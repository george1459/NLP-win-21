                                                                                                                         SENATOR MCCAIN STATEMENT ON NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT OF FY    08 December 14  2007    U S  Senator John McCain  R Ariz   today submitted the following statement about the Conference Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 08 for the Congressional Record    Mr  President  I sincerely congratulate Chairman Levin  the Members of our Committee  and our House colleagues for their work on the Conference Report to accompany the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act  With provisions that authorize a considerable pay raise for all military personnel  increase Army and Marine end strength  reform the system that serves wounded veterans  and help prevent waste  fraud  and abuse in defense contracting and procurement  this conference report undoubtedly contains many important elements that will help support our national defense and  in particular  our servicemen and women  However  this conference report also contains other provisions that are very problematic  In fact  so flawed are those provisions that  despite all that is good in the conference reportand there is muchI must respectfully decline to sign it    In this years conference report  and the accompanying bill  there are  5 3 billion in earmarks  That does not even include about  330 million worth of military construction pork airdropped by the House Appropriatorsdespite having enacted ethics reform legislation just two months ago  Of that  5 3 billion   2 3 billion came from the Senate and  4 1 billion originated in the House  The disparity between the two bills is unprecedented   Almost half of the total amount of pork in this conference report  and the accompanying Bill  arises from a single provision that authorizes the procurement of eight C 17 Globemaster aircraft that the Defense Department states we neither need nor can afford  I should also note that this Conference Report stripped out an important amendment that called for all congressionally directed spending on new programs and grants to be subject to full and open competition  In my view  the massive pork spending in this conference report renders it a frontal assault on this bodys purported commitment to ethics and earmark reform and  in my view  results in a inexcusable failure in our obligation to the taxpayer   The conference report also contains troubling provisions that will likely fail to cure abuses in multi year contracting  possibly weaken the ability of the Department of Defense to waive protectionist restrictions on the purchase of weapon systems containing specialty metals  and allow the Air Force to precipitously retire fully capable aircraft just so it can buy new ones  Therefore  while many elements in this conference report are undoubtably helpful  I regrettably cannot sign it      Authorization of additional C 17 aircraft  Clearly  the most egregious single item in this report is a provision that authorizes the Air Force  2 28 billion to buy eight C 17 Globemaster aircraft  I note that the dollar amount associated with this one provision  which originated in the House  nearly equals the total amount of earmarks in this bill that arose from the entire Senate side     This provision is particularly problematic given that the Secretary of Defense has consistently maintained that the Defense Department met its strategic airlift requirements with the final purchase of C 17 aircraft authorized by the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act and  therefore  simply does not need any more C 17 aircraft  In fact  during deliberations with the conferees  the Defense Department conveyed concern that continuing the C 17 production line would compete with the Departments number one priority for strategic airlift  the recapitalization of the aerial refueling tanker fleet  Reflecting that view  the Presidents Budget Request for fiscal year 2008 included no funding for additional C 17 aircraft and  as it did last year  asked for money to begin shutting down the C 17 production line    In 2007  Congress allowed the Air Force to buy 10 C 17 aircraft above what it actually needed  This year  in their collective wisdom  the conferees have seen it fit to repeat that multibillion dollar mistake by providing for a follow on purchase  in the face of the Administrations admonitions  At the end of the day  this provision does little else than subsidize the continuation of the contractors C 17 production line  which is nearing its enda corporate handout at its worst    I am particularly concerned about this provision given that I have uncovered compelling evidence of possible wrongdoing in the Air Forces interaction with the contractor on the C 17 matter  That evidence points to a disturbing level of effortundertaken jointly by the Air Force and the contractorto undermine the current program of record and support a procurement proposal for which there is no validated requirement and which is not reflected in either the Presidents Budget Request or even the Air Forces own Future Years Defense Program  FYDP   In its rank aggressiveness  the evidence I found  and referred to the appropriate authorities for further review  is not unlike some of what I observed in the Boeing tanker lease scandal  From those authorities  I understand that a review is pending  When faced with similar circumstances concerning the Boeing tanker matter  we suspended procurement activities until all related investigations were concluded  Prudence requires that  at a minimum  we do the same here    Military Construction Pork  This conference report also includes authorization for 52 new military construction projects totaling  328 million requested by individual Members of the House that were not vetted or included in either the House  or the Senate passed National Defense Authorization Bills for FY 2008  On October 30  2007  the House Appropriations Military Construction Veterans Affairs Subcommittee slipped this bloated earmark list to the House Armed Services Committee with no public review or semblance of transparency  And  in order to maintain comity with the appropriators  the majority of defense bill conferees  over my objections  decided to insert the authorizations into our conference report  Not only is this is a classic example of parachuting or airdropping earmarks into a conference report in the dead of night  which we ostensibly sought to stop with the enactment of a new ethics law two months ago  it is also an abrogation of our role as authorizers to fully vet each new matter we considerrather than blindly accept what the appropriators tell us  Despite the rhetoric of a new day for accountability  allowing such practices reflects that there is no transparency in this process  Regrettably  the conferees appear content to hide behind parliamentary tricks and mental gymnastics while knowing full well the spirit and intent of the reform we sought to achieve earlier this year  Saying that over  300 million in pork construction projects can be added in conference means that there is essentially no limit on how much a program or a project can balloon during conference  This is a hog call if I ve ever heard one   Prohibition on Use of Earmarks to Award No Bid Contracts and Noncompetitive Grants  Senate amendment 828 to the Senate passed Bill applied federal competitive bidding laws and regulations to congressional earmarks  Rather modest in what it sought to do  that provision would not have prohibited Members of Congress from earmarking defense dollars  Instead  it simply would have ensured that taxpayers received the advantage of a competitive process  Under that provision  a Member of Congress in either body would have retained the prerogative to fund an activity that he deems worthy  but a full and open competitive process would be used to select the most qualified entity to undertake the project  If an activity is important enough to require earmarking of taxpayers dollars  that legislative proposal would simply have required transparency and full and open competition  Moreover  waiver authority was built into the provision to allow the Department reasonable flexibility in its implementation  In my view  that important provision should have been included in this conference report    Multi year Contracting  The provision that I originally offered as an amendment to the Senate version of the bill clarified how much savings would be required to achieve under a multi year contract before Congress could authorize that procurement mechanism to buy the largest and most expensive weapon systems  That clarification was important to help the Defense Department use multi year contracts responsibly to capitalize on mature  well run programs by buying at economically efficient ratesnot to insulate poorly performing systems from effective congressional oversight  While the multi year contracting provision in the conference report is helpful  it contains language that allows the Department to waive its stringent requirements in a way that eviscerate the provisions underlying intent  In other words  the waiver provision appears to create a loophole through which the Department can keep chronically poor performing programs on rails and away from meaningful congressional oversight    Aircraft Retirements  For some time now  I have been concerned about how the Air Force  in particular  has been creating requirements for procuring new aircraft by precipitously retiring older but reliable  platforms to bulk up buys of new aircraft platforms  This has required this Committee to legislatively prohibit  in previous authorization bills  the retirement of KC 135s  B 52s  C 5s  U 2s and C 130s  In this years conference report  we have unwisely relieved at least a couple of those restrictions    The Air Forces number one acquisition priority is to replace its aged KC 135 fleet of tanker aircraft  The Air Forces original attempt to replace that fleet led to the now infamous Boeing tanker lease scandal  which resulted in jail time for a top Air Force procurement official and Boeings chief operating officer    This time  the Air Force intends to implement a comprehensive tanker replacement strategy  one component of which is the purchase of a new  commercial derivative tanker  On that component  two contractor teams have submitted offers responding to a request for proposals  which the Air Force is now reviewing  A contract may be awarded as soon as late February 2008  Unfortunately  on the other two components of the strategyimplementing a complementary commercial fee for service program and re engining some of its older KC 135sthe Air Force has made no serious headway  Against that backdrop  I remain concerned that the Air Force may simply maximize its desired purchase of new planes  Several studies conducted by both the Air Force and independent groups indicate that the current KC 135 fleet is viable for the intermediate term  Given that taxpayers have made a significant investment in the KC 135 fleet  the Air Force should not be permitted to precipitously retire them simply because it wants to buy as many new tanker aircraft as possible    The Air Force Fleet Viability Board  KC 135 Assessment Report cautioned that  before retiring KC 135s  the Air Force needs to conduct destructive testing so it can proceed on an informed basis  However  the Air Force has not complied with that recommendation  Nonetheless  section 135 of this conference report allows the Secretary of the Air Force to retire immediately 48 KC 135E tanker aircraft  It also allows the Air Force to start retiring the remaining 37 KC 135E during FY08 after contract award for the KC X tanker replacement aircraft  Once again  without reasonably restricting the Air Forces retirement of KC 135s  we may have lost the ability to ensure that the Air Force does not replace its current fleet of tanker aircraft by simply maximizing its purchase of commercial derivative aircrafta solution that simply disregards the interests of the taxpayer    A provision on the retirement of C 130 airlift aircraft is similarly improvident  That provision  section 133  would repeal the requirement in the FY 2007 National Defense Authorization Act that any C 130E aircraft retired in FY 2007 be maintained in a condition that would allow recall of the aircraft to active service  Another provision  section 134  would allow for the retirement of 29 more C 130E aircraft in fiscal year 2008    Without the Departments requirements for tactical airlift capability well defined  it would be premature to retire any C 130 aircraft  at least until   1  an Air Force Fleet Viability Board has conducted an assessment of the C 130E H fleet of aircraft  and  2  the results of the Intra Theater Lift Capability Study  ITLCS   phases 1 and 2  identify the right mix and number of intra theater airlift assets  Therefore  I believe that we should not retire any more C 130 aircraft until the Department determines what its intra theater lift requirements are and that aircraft already should not be stripped for parts or destroyed until we have the results of the requirements analysis    Specialty Metals Buy America Provisions  This conference report also contains several policy provisions that weakens the broad waiver authority that the Department of Defense currently has with regard to weapon systems that contain specialty metals  For a long time  I have tried to lessen the impact of  if not entirely eliminate  Buy America restrictions  including the Berry Amendment  in Defense Department purchases  Legislation restricting the Departments purchases along those lines tend to direct spending for the benefit of a particular entity or congressional district  So  I am concerned that  with the specialty metals Buy America policy provisions contained in this conference report  we may have further opened the door for more pork legislation in the future  Finally  as those policy provisions were not in either the Senate  or the House passed defense bills  I question whether those provisions should have been added in conference   Policy Relating to Major combatant Vessels of the Strike Force  Another objectionable provision in the conference report would establish a policy that future major combatant ships be nuclear powered  regardless of requirements  cost  or other considerations that go into selecting a new ship class propulsion system  The Secretary of Defense could only seek a waiver of this requirement if he determines that nuclear propulsion for a future ship is not in the national interest  If the next cruiser class  CG X   is required to be nuclear powered as a result of this policy  its cost will increase by greater than  1 billion and the ship will be delayed several years  The result would be significantly increased cost  fewer ships  and delays in fielding the next major surface combatant class of ships  At a time when the Secretary of the Navy is doing all he can to reform how the Navy goes about buying its biggest and most expensive weapon systems  this provision is a move in the wrong direction      Other  The conference report also includes a provision that sets a very dangerous precedent by in effect forcing the Department to take action for the benefit of certain Members of Congress  Section 2846  entitled Transfer of jurisdiction  former Nike missile site  Grosse Ile  Michigan  mandates that the Department of Defense spend funds from an account that has historically been guided by an objective assessment of the risk to human health  This provision requires the Corps of Engineers to clean up a site to a higher standard than the Army deems necessary in Gross Ile  Michigan  so the property can be used as a wildlife refuge  Let me be clear  I have nothing against refuges  But  the Department of Defense has over 9 900 properties evaluated as Formerly Used Defense Sites  FUDS  and must conduct cleanup projects at more than 3 000 of them  The FUDS program costs the Department over  250 million a year and is expected to cost the Department  18 7 billion when all said and done    We simply cannot afford allowing individual Members of Congress to move their pet projects to the top of the priority list  completely disregarding the risk to health and safety of other more vital projects  Clean up should be based on the priority of risk  not political muscle   There was another conference decision which I believe may be very detrimental to our role as an authorizing committee  Senate passed bill  Senate section 2811  General Military Construction Transfer Authority  was intended to extend to military construction accounts the current congressional review process for requests from the Department of Defense for the reprogramming of funds between accounts  Currently  for every funding account except military construction  the Secretary of Defense notifies all four defense committees of his intent to transfer funds from one account to another during the year to better manage obligations  However  for military construction accounts  the Secretary sends a notification only to the House and Senate subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  The Senate provision sought to extend that oversight responsibility to our conferees on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees  That was a good provision  It was included in our Senate markup without question and was agreed to by both the House and Senate staffs during conference    However  at the last moment during conference deliberations  Members from the House Appropriations Committee persuaded my fellow conference leaders to drop the provision for no substantive reason  other than it would diminish the power of the appropriators  This capitulation is very troubling  The provision was written in response to recent actions by the Appropriations subcommittees that either held up military construction reprogramming requests based on parochial interests or approved reprogramming requests over the objections of this Committees staff  In particular  we were concerned by the proposal made by the Air Force to the Committees on Appropriations in January 2007 to use the existing reprogramming process to carry out a new start military construction project that had not been authorized by lawa clear challenge to the role of the authorizing committees over new start military construction    The Committee was also concerned that the appropriators in both bodies approved a reprogramming in July 2007 for a military construction project for which no funds were appropriated in fiscal year 2007  as a favor to a particular Memberdisregarding the policy implications of the action  Also  earlier this year  the Senate appropriators held up approval of two reprogramming requests for projects in Virginia in order to force the Department to act on other reprogramming requests  If this Committee had equal authority  we would have the ability to prevent such shamelessly parochial and institutionally divisive behavior  Senate section 2811 would have put an end to such activity between the appropriators and authorizers by establishing equal footing with regard to reprogramming requests on military construction projects  I am at a complete loss why it was dropped from our conference agreement    Again  while there is much in this years conference report that is very worthwhile and helpful to helping provide for the national defense  the elements contained within it that move in the wrong direction are too numerous  too large  and too costly for any Member to ignore  With those elements in this conference report  I simply cannot in good conscience tell the American people that this is our bestthat this conference report represents our best vision for the country on matters that relate to  or affect  our servicemen and women and how we secure our national security interests abroad  By declining to sign this conference report today  I respectfully convey to the Chairman and my fellow conferees my belief that we can  and for the sake of both the warfighter and taxpayer  we must do better  Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor                                                      December
