                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT INTRODUCING THE DIGNIFIED TREATMENT OF WOUNDED WARRIORS ACT June 13  2007 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record on the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act   Mr  MCCAIN   Mr  President  as ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee I am pleased to co sponsor the  Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act   which would ensure that wounded and injured members of the Armed Forces receive the care and benefits that they deserve    We were all surprised and deeply disappointed by the conditions at Walter Reed and the problems that our wounded warriors faced after their inpatient care was complete    living in substandard conditions at Building 18  being treated poorly  battling a Cold War era disability evaluation process  and for some    simply falling through the cracks     Since February of 2007  many encouraging changes have been initiated by the Department of Defense  First and foremost  Secretary Gates established and enforced a culture of accountability for the leadership failures that lead to the tragedy at Walter Reed  Medical facilities have now been inspected by all three military departments  and improvements are underway  Additional counselors and support has been provided to families  On April 25  2007  a new Warrior Transition Brigade stood up at Walter Reed to manage all the needs of wounded and ill soldiers  both Active and Reserve  And DoD has begun to exert greater management responsibility for the disability evaluation systems of the military departments  We re on the right track to address the problems at Walter Reed and at other hospitals  We need to ensure that the effort is sustained  This legislation will ensure that these efforts continue    The legislation requires that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs work together to develop new policy to better manage the care and transition of our wounded soldiers  This policy would address many of the concerns that have been raised by wounded soldiers and their families    conditions while in a medical hold status  the need to streamline and make more transparent the medical and physical evaluation board processes  policies that facilitate the return to duty for soldiers who are able  and a policy governing the smooth transition of separating service members from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs which focuses on the needs of patients    This legislation would improve health care benefits to severely wounded soldiers by extending their health care benefits as if the member were on active duty for a period of up to five years  This approach ensures that our most severely wounded have as many health care options as possible  especially for treatment of traumatic brain injury and other long term serious conditions    This legislation authorizes additional funding for traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder and requires the establishment of two Centers of Excellence for the prevention  research and treatment on these consequences of war  This legislation would also require DoD to develop a comprehensive plan for research  prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injury  which is long overdue in addressing the so called signature injury of this war    The Administration requested  and this bill would provide  additional authorities to the Department of Defense to hire health care professionals to care for our service members and their families  It would also require the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop an electronic health record that can easily be shared between the two departments    With respect to disability determinations for wounded warriors who leave military service  this legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to establish a special review board to independently review the findings and decisions of the Physical Evaluation Boards of the military departments since 2001  in cases in which the disability rates of 20 percent or less were awarded and members were not medically retired  We must act  in light of data showing that some members    particularly junior enlisted soldiers    may have unfairly been denied medical retirement  This legislation empowers the special board to correct military records and  if appropriate  restore to a wounded soldier a higher disability rating or retired status    The bill would also end the requirement that disabled service members pay back severance pay if they obtain a higher disability rating from the VA  and increase the amount of severance pay that separating members receive    To address the need for fundamental change in the way that the DoD and VA disability evaluation systems are structured    a belief shared by many of my colleagues    this legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to immediately implement pilot projects to test new improvements to the disability evaluation system  Such pilot programs will help expedite implementation of needed changes to the disability evaluation system    This legislation would also require the Secretary of Defense to establish uniform standards for medical treatment facilities and medical residential housing facilities  and a DoD investment strategy to remedy all medical facility deficiencies   It would also require the Secretary of Defense to study the feasibility of accelerated construction of state of the art facilities and consolidation of patient care services at the new National Medical Center at Bethesda  As a condition for the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center  it would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that health care services would remain available in their totality until the new facility and staff are in place to effect a seamless transfer of care  The current facilities at Walter Reed have served the nation well    but we can and must do better    Mr  President  this legislation is a start on the journey to restore trust for America s wounded and her veterans  but it is not our final destination  It will take time to understand fully the complexities of the DoD and VA disability systems and to reconcile them in the best interests of our wounded veterans    We must also look to the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve access to care for wounded veterans and improvements in its handling of veterans claims for disabilities  We must ensure that the VA maintains a robust medical infrastructure for quality health care  teaching and research  but one that also supports veterans beyond the limits of bricks and mortar in communities throughout the nation  I am developing legislation which would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish health care access standards for veterans with a service connected disability throughout the VA health care delivery system  and  similar to DoD s TRICARE system  when services cannot be provided by the VA  authorize that care to be purchased from civilian providers  Civilian health care specialists are eager to do their part for America s veterans  Given the strain on the veterans health system  and the limits to our resources  we should give them that chance  and make certain that our nation s veterans get the care that they need  when they need it    There is no more important responsibility than to act on our moral obligation as a nation to those who are willing to give their blood for its freedom  Let us continue to be guided by the words of President George Washington in 1789  who said   the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country       I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Levin and me in a bipartisan effort to make a difference in the lives of our service members who have given so much in support of our nation                                             June 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
