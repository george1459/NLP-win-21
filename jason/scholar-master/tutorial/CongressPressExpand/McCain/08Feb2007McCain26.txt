                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN STATEMENT ON HJ RES 20 February 14  2007 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ   today made the following statement on H J  Res 20 Making Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2007       Mr  President  I think most of us agree that funding the federal government should be done through the regular order  not through a patch work of continuing resolutions  The reality is that all but two federal agencies are being funded through a measure to which no member is being permitted to offer  debate  or vote on a single amendment  That is wrong  We are not the House of Representatives  We are the Senate   the deliberative body  I hope the Senate leadership on both sides will work to ensure that we don   t repeat this fate      There is one silver lining to the measure pending before us  It is largely free of wasteful earmarking and pork barrel spending  This is the first time during my years in Congress that I have witnessed such an occurrence  Compare this to the last fiscal year  2006  according to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service  the appropriations bills and accompanying reports for the last fiscal year included  64 Billion in earmarks   the largest earmarked funding in history  So again  this CR  which does not have an accompanying report where historically 95 percent of earmarks are included  is a welcome  welcome change  I can only urge the Appropriations Committee to let this be a guide for future appropriations measures when it comes to earmarks   don   t include them and don   t waste the taxpayers dollars      I was pleased to join with several of my colleagues in writing the President last week to urge his leadership on this issue and ensure his Administration understands clearly and fully that it is under absolutely no obligation to continue to fund earmarks that were included in past committee reports or urged by members of Congress or their staff  As stated by the President in his State of the Union address just last month  when it comes to earmarking     The time has come to end this practice     It is up to the Administration to abide by the President   s directive and I assure you  we will be watching       Also last week  Senator Coburn and I received a response from Department of Energy Secretary  Sam Bodman  in response to our letter the previous week stating our serious concerns about reports that the Department may be planning    business as usual    and would fund conference report earmarks  Fortunately  the Secretary has clarified his Department   s position  and will only fund programs or activities that are    meritorious and effective    and    support and advance the Department   s missions and objectives       I ask unanimous consent that copies of our correspondence with the Secretary be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks       Despite what I have described as a positive consequence of this CR  the measure is imperfect and  like many of my colleagues  I believe we should have had an opportunity to improve it  I am particularly concerned about underfunding the Base Realignment Closure  BRAC  account  and was pleased to join in cosponsoring the amendment filed by Senators Hutchison and Inhofe to fund the account at the amount requested by the President and the amount we authorized for 2007       Mr  President  the 55 percent cut to the BRAC account  submitted without any type of justification or explanation  seriously jeopardizes the Department of Defense   s ability to meet a statutory deadline to complete all BRAC actions by 2011  Congress imposed this six year deadline specifically to limit the negative impact on the military units and local communities around the country affected by BRAC  Congress intended that a concentrated period of investment would accelerate the economic development and recovery of communities affected by BRAC  This callous decision to deny funds to the Department at this critical juncture directly harms these communities as much as it does the military units placed in limbo by the sudden denial of funds      The Administration noted in its recent response to the CR that the BRAC cut will  reduce BRAC savings  delay or postpone scheduled redeployments of military personnel and their families from overseas locations to the United States  and negatively impact many communities throughout the country that have begun making specific plans in response to BRAC         Surely our colleagues who developed this CR proposal did not intend to cause additional harm to the local communities that are already trying to cope and recover from the BRAC decisions  Quoting Congressman David Obey  Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee  about the CR   I don t expect people to love this proposal  I don t love this proposal  and we probably have made some wrong choices        So  why are we in the Senate not allowed an opportunity to correct an obvious mistake       Mr  President  I   ve heard from the other side of the aisle during debate of H J  Res 20 that they understand this problem and that they plan to correct this  3 1 billion BRAC underfunding in the Fiscal Year 2007 Emergency Supplemental request of  93 4 billion  What kind of solution is that  Supplemental funds have been requested by the President for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  These funds are critically needed to purchase equipment for force protection and IED defeat initiatives  These funds will be used to train and equip Iraqi security forces  Since when is BRAC an emergency related to the Global War on Terror      Furthermore  we are having this discussion because my colleagues who developed the resolution share with us the common goal to reduce overall government expenditures  In that spirit  what critical warfighting requirement will we cut in the supplemental to pay for the BRAC increase they propose  What do we deny to our front line fighting troops  While I have heard the idea of funding BRAC in the supplemental  I have not heard one idea on how to pay for it  Do they instead advocate for an increase to the supplemental  Why not just provide the funds to BRAC by offsets in the pending measure before us  as proposed by the Hutchison amendment  We should be addressing full fiscal year 2007 funding for BRAC in this CR  Using budget gimmicks and shell games in a supplemental  which could have devastating results for the military and local communities  is not the way to provide appropriations for critical military requirements       And  finally  Mr  President  I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague  Dr  Coburn  He has been on the floor several times to discuss the very serious ramifications of the provision in this bill that will prohibit funding for what is known as the    baby AIDS    program  I   ve often commented that we need to start making tough fiscal decisions around here among competing priorities  But I have yet to hear anyone defend or even attempt to explain the decision that was made to prohibit funding for this critical program       I completely agree with Dr  Coburn  This funding prohibition is regrettable  and may have far reaching and devastating consequences for those helpless babies who could otherwise be given a better chance at having and keeping healthy lives      I yield the floor
