                                                                                                                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON THE    SECOND LOOK AT WASTEFUL SPENDING ACT OF 2007 January 24  2007  Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record on providing the President with recission authority     Mr  President  I am pleased to join Senator Gregg and others in supporting this fiscally responsible amendment to provide the President authority to perform rescissions to legislation passed by Congress  Congress would then be required to review the President   s recommendation within eight days and affirm or reject the recommendation  Additionally  this amendment correctly requires the money from rescissions to be put toward deficit reduction     Congress has grappled with the issue of providing the President with line item veto or rescission authority since the original law was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1998  In the last Congress  there were at least eight bills introduced  including one I authored  attempting to provide the President with the authority to review and reject objectionable sections of legislation passed by Congress  It is my hope that during the 110th Congress we will provide the President with this important tool to combat pork barrel spending and to reduce the deficit     Just last night  President Bush delivered the annual State of the Union address in which he stressed the need to impose spending discipline here in Washington by cutting the number earmarks  He is not the only President to address the country about the need to curtail wasteful pork barrel spending     In 1988  during his final State of the Union Address  President Ronald Reagan discussed the growth of earmarks and asked for line item veto authority for future Presidents  On that evening  President Reagan carried with him three pieces of legislation  an appropriations bill that was 1 053 pages long and weighed 14 pounds  a budget reconciliation bill that was 1 186 pages long and weighed 15 pounds  and a continuing resolution that was 1 057 pages long and weighed 14 pounds     In reference to the continuing resolution  President Reagan chided Congress stating     Most of you in this Chamber didn   t know what was in this catch all bill and report     President Reagan then explained that millions of dollars for items such as cranberry research  blueberry research  the study of crawfish  and the commercialization of wild flowers were included in the continuing resolution    tucked away behind a little comma here and there       In 1987  Ronald Reagan vetoed a highway bill because it had 157 earmarks  In the last Congress  a highway bill with 6 371 special projects costing the taxpayers  24 billion dollars was enacted  despite my strong opposition  Those and other earmarks passed by Congress included  50 million for an indoor rainforest   500 000 for a teapot museum   350 000 for an Inner Harmony Foundation and Wellness Center  and  223 million for a    Bridge to Nowhere        Unfortunately  this earmarking has not been limited to the highway bill  Nothing can compare to the out of control earmarking that has occurred in the annual appropriations measures during recent years  According to data gathered by Congressional Research Service  there were 4 126 earmarks in 1994  In 2005  there were 15 877  an increase of nearly 400 percent  There was a little good news in 2006  solely due to the fact that the Labor HHS appropriations bill was approved almost entirely free of earmarks     an amazing feat given that there were over 3 000 earmarks the prior year in that bill  Despite this first reduction in 12 years  it doesn   t change the fact that 2004  2005  and 2006 produced the greatest number of earmarks in history     Now  let   s consider the level of funding associated with those earmarks  The amount of earmarked funding increased from  23 2 billion in 1994 to  64 billion in FY 2006  Remarkably  it rose by 34 percent from 2005 to 2006  even though the number of earmarks decreased  Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000  and more than tripled in the last 10 years  This is wrong and disgraceful and we urgently need to curtail this seemingly out of control pork barreling practice that has become the norm around here     President Reagan would be deeply disturbed to know that almost 20 years later  the size of spending bills has gotten much  much larger as we put more money toward pork barrel projects  These earmarks have allowed the national debt to grow from over  5 trillion when President Reagan left office in January 1989 to over  8 trillion today   Mr  President  these statistics demonstrate clearly that the need for rescission authority is much greater than when President Reagan was in office     President Reagan said to Congress during his 1988 State of the Union address     Let   s help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the President a tool that  though I will not get to use  is one I know future Presidents of either party must have  Give the President     the right to reach into massive appropriation bills  pare away the waste  and enforce budget discipline     This amendment would do just that  It would provide the President authority to identify wasteful items of spending and move to eliminate them from the Federal budget  This would be a significant     and unfortunately all too rare     move in Washington  DC towards fiscal discipline     Rescission authority alone is not the solution to the fiscal crisis we face in our nation   s capitol  We also desperately need to reform our earmarking process and our lobbying practices     and the legislation the Senate passed last week makes a number of positive improvements in those areas  But above all  we must remember that it is ultimately Congress   s responsibility to control spending  However  granting the President line item veto authority would go a long way toward restoring credibility to a system ravaged by congressional waste and special interest pork    I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment                                                January 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
