                                                                                                                         MCCAIN PROPOSES RAIL SECURITY AMENDMENT September 8  2006  Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding an amendment he proposed regarding rail security   Mr  President  I call up amendment  4922 and ask for its immediate consideration   This amendment would ensure that  in addition to our efforts to improve port security  we also address another critical transportation mode  rail transportation  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators DeWine  Snowe and Biden   Mr  President  I am pleased that the Senate has chosen to take up the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 to protect our nations ports and waterways  The bill implements several recommendations from the 9 11 Commissions Final Report  including allocating security grants based on risk and comprehensive cargo screening  Additionally  the bill would establish an office within the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate all cargo security policy  develop a strategy for deployment of radiation detection capabilities in all ports  and establish a process to facilitate the movement of secure cargo from international ports to our ports without interrupting the international supply chain and delaying goods to consumers here in the United States   Securing our ports is a crucial part of our efforts to protect Americans at home  The amendment that I am offering today would complement the underlying legislation by providing essential funding and additional tools to strengthen our Nations rail system   Two years ago  the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Rail Security Act of 2004  legislation that was almost identical to the amendment that I am offering today  Unfortunately  that bill died in the House of Representatives  Last year  I reintroduced the legislation shortly after the London bombings of July 7  and language that is similar to the provisions of the Rail Security Act is in a title of the transportation security bill that was reported by the Commerce Committee in February  I sincerely hope that we will once again pass this important legislation  Rail security must be made a top priority of this Congress   Mr  President  we were all deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life caused by the 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid  the 2005 London attacks  and the terrorist attacks on commuter trains in Mumbai this summer  Those incidents are a painful reminder of the cruel nature of our enemies in our global war on terror  and of what we must do to fight and win against those who wish to eradicate our way of life  I have said on many occasions that we cannot just play defense in this war    that instead we must take the fight to the enemy  Still  we must do what is possible and prudent to protect Americans at home  The numerous attacks on rail systems abroad demonstrate all too vividly the continuing need for this legislation   There is little doubt that we have increased dramatically our security capabilities over the past five years  However  there is just as little doubt that we have much more to do  Since the attacks of 9 11  only relatively modest resources have been dedicated to rail security  Our Nations transit system  Amtrak  and the freight railroads  I am sad to say  remain vulnerable to terrorist threats  This lack of funding exists despite the fact that the Department of Homeland Security has identified as potential terrorist targets the freight and passenger rail networks  which are critical to the nations transportation system and national defense  The 9 11 Commission  too  in its report on the facts and circumstances surrounding the 9 11 attacks  called for improved security in all modes of transportation  noting that       terrorists may turn their attention to other modes   This amendment would authorize a total of almost  1 2 billion dollars for rail security  More than half of this funding would be authorized to complete tunnel safety and security improvements at New Yorks Penn Station  which is used by over 500 000 transit  commuter  and intercity passengers each workday  This funding is all the more urgent given this summer s arrest by the FBI of eight suspects tied to al Qaeda who were plotting attacks on train tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey   The legislation would also establish a grant program  authorized at  350 million dollars  to help increase security by the freight railroads  Amtrak  shippers of hazardous materials  and local governments with security responsibility for passenger stations not owned by Amtrak  Further  DHS would be required to complete a vulnerability assessment of the rail network to terrorist attack and make recommendations to Congress for addressing security weaknesses  Importantly  to protect the taxpayers  interests  all Amtrak authorizations would be managed by the Department of Transportation through formal grant agreements   Mr  President  we face a dedicated  focused  and intelligent foe in the war on terrorism  This enemy will probe to find our weaknesses and move against them  We have seen the vulnerabilities of rail to terrorism in other countries and the devastating consequences of such an attack  It is essential that we move expeditiously to protect all the modes of transportation from potential attack   Also  Mr  President  at this point I would like to note that this amendment is cosponsored by Senators DeWine  Snowe  and Biden  I thank the senators for their cosponsorship of this critical measure   I trust that the Senate will once again pass this essential legislation  We owe at least that much to the American people as we continue our struggle against an enemy that wants nothing less than to destroy everything we stand for and believe in
