2007 Washington  D C      U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today introduced the Indian Tribes Methamphetamine Act of 2007  Below are Senator McCain   s remarks as submitted for the record       Mr  President  today I am introducing the Indian Tribes Methamphetamine Reduction Grants Act of 2007  This bill is identical to S  4113  a bipartisan measure that was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on December 8  2006  the last day of the 109th Congress  The legislation would allow Indian tribes to be eligible for funding through the Department of Justice to eradicate the scourge of methamphetamine use  sale and manufacture in Native American communities  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dorgan  Baucus  Grassley  Reid  Feinstein  and Feingold in introducing this important legislation      Mr  President  the impacts of methamphetamine use on communities across the Nation are well known and cannot be overstated  Methamphetamine is the leading drug related law enforcement problem in the country  Unfortunately  the meth crisis is affecting Indian Country most severely  Very serious concerns have been raised by the U S  Department of Justice  states  and other non tribal law enforcement agencies over the rapidly growing levels of methamphetamine production and trafficking on reservations with large geographic areas or tribes adjacent to the U S  Mexico border  But because of the sovereign status of the tribes  criminals are generally not subject to state jurisdiction in many cases  As a result  local law enforcement often has no jurisdiction in Indian country  and tribal law enforcement agencies bear the brunt of most law enforcement functions      The problem of meth in Indian country  which the National Congress of American Indians identified last year as its top priority  is ubiquitous  and has strained already overburdened law enforcement  health  social welfare  housing  and child protective and placement services on Indian reservations  Last year a former tribal judge on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and other drugs  The day before  the Navajo Nation police arrested an 81 year old grandmother  her daughter  and her granddaughter  for selling meth  One tribe in Arizona had over 60 babies born with meth in their systems  In 2005  the National Indian Housing Council expanded its training for dealing with meth in tribal housing  the average cost of decontaminating a single residence that has been used a meth lab is  10 000       During the 109th Congress  as the Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee  I held hearings on this serious matter  Committee witnesses testified that the methamphetamine epidemic in Indian country has contributed to a rise in child abuse and neglect cases  among other social ills  and some tribes reported dramatic increases in suicide rates among young people linked to methamphetamine use  Following our hearings  I was pleased to work with Senators Dorgan  Session  Bingaman and others in improving upon our legislation to assist Indian Country in fighting this terrible drug crisis      To avoid any potential misinterpretation of the intent of this legislation  this bill includes language developed and agreed to during the last Congress that is designed to clarify the intent of the bill  This clarifying language  provided in section 2 a  4  of the bill  is intended to make it clear that by authorizing the Department of Justice   s Bureau of Justice Assistance to award grant funds to a state  territory or Indian tribe to    investigate  arrest and prosecute individuals    involved in illegal methamphetamine activities  the legislation does not somehow authorize a grantee state  territory or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities that it otherwise has no jurisdiction to pursue  And similarly  this provision also clarifies that an award or denial of a grant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance does not somehow allow a state  territory or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities that it otherwise lacks jurisdiction to pursue  For example  a law enforcement agency in one state  territory or Indian reservation is not somehow enabled by this section  or by an award made pursuant to this section  to prosecute a methamphetamine crime arising in some other jurisdiction unless that agency already has such jurisdiction      The legislation further clarifies that authority under the bill to award grants would have no effect beyond simply authorizing  awarding or denying a grant of funds to a state  territory or Indian tribe  So  for example  if a state  territory or Indian tribe is awarded or denied a grant of funds under this section  that award or denial has no relevance to or effect on the eligibility of the state  territory or Indian tribe to participate in any other program or activity unrelated to the award or denial of grants as permitted under this legislation  The award or denial of a grant under this subsection  in other words  is relevant only to the award or denial of the grant under this subsection  and nothing else      The measure I am introducing today takes but a small step on the long journey toward our fight against methamphetamine  I encourage my colleagues to support it                                                 January 2007 Press Releases
