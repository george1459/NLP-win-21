                                                                                                                         MCCAIN STATEMENT ON STEM CELL RESEARCH July 18  2006 Washington D C     Today  Senator McCain  R AZ  submitted the following statement for the Congressional record on the issue of stem cell research   Mr  President  I will vote in support of all three bills under consideration today  which together provide a framework for addressing the issue of stem cell research  This research holds the potential to unlock cures that could defeat deadly diseases and relieve tremendous human suffering  At the same time  one type of stem cell research  involving embryonic stem cells  has also raised serious ethical and moral concerns  both inside and outside the medical community  I believe the framework provided by the three bills before us today offers a way forward   S 2754 offers increased federal funding and support for adult stem cell research and other types of stem cell research that do not involve the use of human embryos  Scientists believe this research holds tremendous potential  and I share their hope  Countless numbers are affected by the many diseases that this type of research may offer future cures   In promoting stem cell research  one of the lines that must not be crossed is the intentional creation of human embryos for purposes of research rather than reproduction  A second bill before us  S 3504  draws a line that says we in the United States will not abandon our values in pursuit of scientific progress  This bill bans the practice of what has been referred to as fetal farming  It makes it a federal crime for researchers to use cells or fetal tissue from an embryo that was created for research purposes  This bill also makes it a federal crime to attempt to use or obtain cells from a human fetus that was gestated in the uterus of a non human animal  These provisions close important gaps in our existing laws  and I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting this bill   It is important that we act now to address these issues  because research involving embryonic stem cells is also proceeding outside the United States  Unfortunately  the intense focus on ethical and moral concerns that has driven the debate in America  as reflected in the President s Commission on Bioethics  is not always present in private industry and the scientific community in other parts of the world  I am concerned about the path that some of this unregulated research leads us down  Of particular concern is the potential for experimentation into human cloning  Our involvement through this legislation is another protection against sanctioning such practice within our own borders   I am concerned that ongoing research elsewhere may result in the routine acceptance of deeply troubling practices  in particular the intentional creation of human embryos for purposes of research rather than reproduction   However  it doesn t have to be this way  The United States offers a climate for scientific and medical research  because of the quality of our educational institutions  the strength of our economy  and the scope of our comprehensive legal and regulatory system for protection of intellectual property rights  The final bill before us  H R  810  will allow us to attract scientists to perform highly regulated embryonic stem cell research that will otherwise take place in an unregulated environment somewhere else  This bill authorizes federal support for embryonic stem cell research  but limits that support to scientists who use embryos originally created for reproductive purposes  and now frozen or slated for destruction by in vitro fertilization clinics  H R  810 requires that prior to even considering whether to donate unused embryos for research  the patient who is the source of the embryos must be consulted  and a determination must be made that these embryos would otherwise be discarded  and would never be implanted in the patient or another woman  This provision ensures that patients with excess embryos will first consider the possibility of embryo adoption  and only if this option is rejected  will the patient then be consulted concerning the possibility of embryo donation  A patient donating embryos that would otherwise remain frozen or be destroyed must give written informed consent  and H R  810 makes it illegal for anyone to offer any sort of financial or other inducement in exchange for this consent   All of these carefully drawn rules contained in H R  810 do not exist in the status quo  and this sort of embryonic stem cell research remains largely unregulated in the private sector and in many parts of the scientific community overseas  Federal oversight that will come with approving this bill will allow us to ensure that this research does not expand into ethically objectionable ground in balancing the promise on the foreseeable horizon of stem cell research with the protection of human life  It should be clearly noted that this type of research will proceed with or without federal approval  so I believe that it is best carried out under strict federal guidelines and oversight  It is my hope that by offering limited federal support in the context of the framework provided by the three bills before us today  we can realize the benefits of stem cell research while also drawing clear lines that reflect our refusal to sacrifice our ethical and moral values for the sake of scientific progress                                                     July 2006
