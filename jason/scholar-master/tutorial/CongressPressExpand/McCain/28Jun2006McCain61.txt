                                                                                                                         MCCAIN URGES REFORM OF 527S June 29  2006 Washington D C    Today  Senator McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on the floor of the United States Senate regarding the 527 Reform Act of 2006 S  2511    Mr  President  I regret that we are not able to move this important piece of legislation  This bill is simple and straightforward  It is designed to overcome the Federal Election Commission s  FEC  inexcusable failure to interpret properly the original Federal Election Campaign Act  FECA  and halt the illegal practice that has sprung up whereby 527 groups are now spending soft money on ads and other activities to influence federal elections   I understand fully the politics surrounding this issue  which unfortunately is going to cause some of my colleagues to oppose any reform  But the time has come to address this issue  We should put political prerogatives aside and do what is best for the American electorate  We need to have this debate  Mr  President  I am committed to working with my colleagues to resolve our differences  Let s bring this bill up  have a debate  and consider amendments   As my colleagues know  a number of 527 groups raised and spent a substantial amount of soft money in a blatant effort to influence the outcome of the 2004 Presidential election  These activities are illegal under existing laws  and yet  the FEC has failed to do its job and has refused to do anything to stop these illegal activities  Therefore  it is now up to Congress to pursue all possible steps to uphold FECA and overturn the FEC s misinterpretation of the campaign finance laws  which is improperly allowing 527 groups  whose purpose is to influence federal elections  to spend soft money on these efforts   In McConnell v  FEC  the Supreme Court noted wisely that money  like water  will look for ways to leak back into the system  With the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002  BCRA   the national parties were taken out of the soft money business  It did not take long before efforts were underway by some to bring soft money back into federal elections through the vehicle of groups that operate as  political organizations  under Section 527 of the IRS Code  or so called 527s  The soft money game is the same with these groups  they are raising multi million dollar donations from wealthy individuals  as well as large contributions from corporate and union contributions  and spending that soft money on broadcast communications that promote or attack federal candidates  and voter mobilization efforts intended to influence federal elections  We saw  firsthand  how a number of 527 groups raised and spent huge amounts of soft money in order to influence the outcome of the last Presidential election  These activities were prohibited under longstanding campaign finance law but  again  the FEC failed to properly enforce the law  As a result  federally oriented 527s spent over  400 million on the 2004 elections   It turns out  Mr  President  that almost half of the financing for 527 groups in the 2004 elections came from a relatively small number of very wealthy individuals who made huge soft money contributions  According to campaign finance scholar Tony Corrado  25 wealthy individuals accounted for  126 million raised by 527 groups active in the 2004 federal elections  This included 10 donors who gave at least  4 million each to 527s involved in the 2004 elections and two donors who each contributed over  20 million   Opponents of campaign reform like to point out that the activities of these 527s serve as proof that BCRA has failed in its stated purpose to eliminate the corrupting influence of soft money in our political campaigns  Let me be perfectly clear on this  Mr  President  The 527 issue has nothing to do with BCRA  It has everything to do with the 1974 law and the failure of the FEC to do its job and properly regulate the activities of these groups  The new campaign finance law   BCRA   has successfully accomplished its goals  Last year  David Broder wrote in The Washington Post  As one who has been skeptical of the claimed virtues of the McCain Feingold campaign finance law  I am happy to concede that it has  in fact  passed its first test in the 2004 campaign with flying colors   Mr  President  it is important to point out that this was accomplished despite all of the predictions at the time about how the national political parties would be financially undermined without soft money  The national political parties raised more hard money in the 2004 election cycle than they raised in hard and soft money combined during the presidential election cycle in 2000  In fact  the Republican and Democratic national parties raised a record  1 2 billion for the 2004 elections   And in doing so  the parties also greatly increased their small donor base and their number of contributors  Again  according to Tony Corrado  the DNC had more than 2    million new donors and the RNC had more than 1 million new donors in the 2004 election  David Broder pointed out in his Post column that  A  solid start has been made in expanding the financial base of both parties and using the resources to bring more people into the electorate  That is all to the good   The fact that the overwhelming majority of federal oriented 527s were created after the enactment of BCRA is no coincidence  Of the 68 Democratic leaning 527 committees involved in the 2004 cycle  54 of them were organized post BCRA  And of the 26 Republican leaning 527 groups involved in 2004  13 were organized after the enactment of legislation which banned the use of soft money in federal elections  These groups were set up with every intention of circumventing the law  And they have succeeded   Mr  President  S  2511 would require that 527s register as political committees and comply with federal campaign finance laws  including federal limits on the contributions they receive  unless the money they raise is spent exclusively in connection with non Federal candidate elections  state or local ballot initiatives  or the nomination or confirmation of individuals to non elected offices  And it upholds the hard fought victory of BCRA   This legislation also would set new rules for federal political committees that spend funds on voter mobilization efforts affecting both federal and local races and  therefore  use both a federal and a non federal account under FEC regulations  The new rules would prevent unlimited soft money from being channeled into federal elections through abuse of the Commission s allocation rules   Under the bill  at least half of the funds spent on voter mobilization activities by federal political committees would have to be hard money from their federal account  More importantly  the funds raised for their non federal account could come only from individuals and would be limited to no more than  25 000 per year per donor  Corporations and labor unions could not contribute to these non federal accounts  To put it in simple terms  a George Soros could give  25 000 per year to the non federal account of a single political committee  as opposed to  22 million  to finance these activities   Let me be perfectly clear on one point  Mr  President  This proposal would NOT shut down 527s  it would simply require them to abide by the same federal campaign finance rules that every other federal political committee must abide by in spending money to influence federal elections  Nor is this bill intended to effect 501  c   3  or  4  tax exempt organizations   Under the Internal Revenue Code  a 527 group is a  political organization   which is a group whose primary purpose is to influence candidate elections or the appointment of individuals to public office  In other words  most 527 groups  by definition  are in the business of influencing campaigns and have voluntarily sought the tax advantages conferred on such political groups  These groups cannot be allowed to shirk their responsibilities to comply with federal campaign finance laws when they are spending money to influence federal elections   The use of soft money by 527 groups to pay for ads attacking and promoting the 2004 presidential candidates was not legal  This is not a matter of the new campaign finance law  BCRA  it is a requirement of longstanding federal campaign finance laws that go back to 1974  That law  as construed by the Supreme Court in Buckley v  Valeo  requires any group that has a Amajor purpose to influence federal elections  and spends  1 000 or more to do so  to register with the Federal Election Commission as a Apolitical committee  and be subject to the contribution limits  source prohibitions and reporting requirements that apply to all political committees   Section 527 groups need to play by the rules that candidates  political parties  and all other political committees are bound by   the rules that Congress has enacted to protect the integrity of our political process  They need to raise and spend money that complies with federal contribution limits and source prohibitions to pay for ads that promote or attack federal candidates or otherwise have the purpose to influence federal elections  They need to spend federal funds for voter mobilization activities that are conducted on a partisan basis and will influence federal elections   just like every other political committee   Some have raised questions about whether it is constitutional to limit contributions to political committees that operate supposedly independent of parties and candidates  I would like to submit for the Record a detailed analysis of these constitutional questions prepared by Professor Daniel Ortiz  the John Allen Love Professor of Law at the University of Virginia School of Law  The memo thoroughly explains the constitutional basis for the legislation we have introduced   As the memo points out  the Supreme Court in the McConnell case spoke directly to this issue and said that such limits are constitutional  The Court specifically noted that in an earlier case  California Medical Association v  FEC  it had upheld the  5 000 limit on contributions to political committees even as to a committee s spending for  noncoordinated expenditures   The constitutional rationale in California Medical Association v  FEC  as in the case of the soft money ban upheld by the Supreme Court in McConnell  is equally applicable to S  2511  It is designed to prevent the evasion and circumvention of federal contribution limits and prohibitions   It is unfortunate that we even need to talking about this situation today  Mr  President  This legislation would not be necessary if it weren t for the abject failure of the FEC to enforce existing law  As I noted earlier  some 527s raised and spent soft money to run ads attacking both President Bush and Senator Kerry  The use of soft money to finance these activities is clearly illegal under current statute  and the fact that they were allowed to continue unchecked is unconscionable   The blame for this lack of enforcement does not lie with the Congress  nor with the Administration  The blame for this continuing illegal activity lies squarely with the FEC  This agency has a duty to issue regulations to properly implement and enforce the nation s campaign laws   and the FEC has failed  and it has failed miserably to carry out that responsibility   Let s consider two recent court rulings  First  in its decision upholding the constitutionality of BCRA in McConnell v  FEC  the U S  Supreme Court stated that the FEC had subverted the law  issued regulations that permitted more than Congress had ever intended  and invited widespread circumvention of FECA s limits on contributions  Additionally  when Judge Kollar Kotelly threw out 15 of the FEC s regulations implementing BCRA  among the reasons for her actions were that one provision severely undermines FECA and would foster corruption  another runs completely afoul of current law  another would render the statute largely meaningless and  finally  that another had no rational basis  No wonder a Los Angeles Times editorial stated that  her decision would make a fitting obituary for an agency that deserves to die  We cannot allow the destructive FEC to continue to undermine the nation s campaign finance laws   An article published just yesterday in The Hill points out that the FEC is being accused of attempting to intimidate soft money donors to 527s by targeting the donors for questioning  The article also makes note of the FEC decision last month not to implement new regulations for 527s this election cycle  That was widely interpreted as a green light for 527s to act without restriction  What is going on here  Mr  President  The job of the FEC is to write regulations to properly implement campaign finance laws   not to bully and intimidate those who choose to donate to groups the FEC refuses to regulate   Mr  President  the track record of the FEC and its continued stonewalling proves that the Commission is incapable of upholding its responsibilities  The time has come to put an end to its destructive tactics  The FEC has had ample  and well documented  opportunities to address the issue of the 527s illegal activities  and each time it has taken a pass  choosing instead to delay  postpone  and refuse to act   BCRA has demonstrated that  on a bipartisan basis  we care about making sure that political power in this country does not lie solely in the hands of big corporations  labor unions and the wealthiest of the wealthy  We need to uphold and build upon past reforms  and not endorse the pursuit of ways to get around or unravel them   Mr  President  I hope my colleagues will recognize the need to enact this legislation                                               June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
