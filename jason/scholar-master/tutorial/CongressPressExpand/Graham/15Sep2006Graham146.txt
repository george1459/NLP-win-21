Statement on Senate Passage of Tribunal Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  made the following statement on legislation which passed the Senate Armed Services Committee establishing tribunals for suspected terrorists   Graham voted in support of the legislation which passed the Committee by a vote of 15 9         First off  let me say that I have a great deal of respect for President Bush and the job he has done leading our nation in the War on Terror   My goal in the tribunal legislation is to ensure the policies we put in place can withstand judicial scrutiny  protect American troops in future conflicts  and live up to the values our nation has adhered to for generations             A conviction against a terror suspect is no good if it is later overturned by the Supreme Court   We don  t need to resort to bizarre legal theories to convict the terrorists   Frankly  we  ve done a better job of keeping the terrorists out of court than their own lawyers with all the legal challenges which have been upheld by federal courts           Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel  the Administration ought to rely  as much as possible  on what has been tried and true   I would like to put one of these terrorists on trial in my lifetime      On the Legislative Process      The House of Representatives has moved legislation establishing military tribunals and it is important the Senate act as well   While the Senate Armed Services Committee has passed a version which does not have the full backing of the White House  I will continue to discuss our approach with them   At some point in the future  the House  Senate  and President will have to come to some agreement we can all accept to move the process forward        The Senate Legislation      The Senate legislation passed today allows the military trials of terrorists to begin  ensures that American troops cannot be sued in federal court by terror suspects in our custody  and establishes a legal framework for continued prosecution of the War on Terror   It also allows the CIA program  supported by the President and me  to continue protecting America           The CIA program is an important program and our legislation does nothing to stop or impede that program from continued operation   I disagree with any suggestion to the contrary           I desperately want to hold terrorists accountable for the acts they have committed against the nation on and since 9 11   They need to be brought to justice  However we must ensure we do so in a manner using policies and procedures that can withstand judicial scrutiny           One area of contention is the use of classified information provided to a terror suspect and what an acquittal in a tribunal would mean           Generals and Admirals from the United States Army  Navy  Air Force  and Marine Corps have shown us the way to address the issue of classified information using procedures already in military law   Under the Senate proposal  the government does not have to give classified information to the defense   The military judge can order summarized or redacted versions of the classified information to be used at trial   However  as the military lawyers have suggested the accused must be provided the evidence the jury uses to convict   Without such a provision  the trial would fail because of the inability to confront evidence           There is one other point on which much confusion exists           Even if a terrorist is acquitted by a military tribunal  that does not mean they will be released from military prison   They remain enemy combatants   The decision to release an enemy combatant is made by the Annual Review Board  ARB   which is already established and in operation at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba      The Supreme Court and Geneva Conventions        The Supreme Court  in a decision I found troubling  decided to apply Geneva Convention protections to the War on Terror   Their decision is binding  but they gave Congress and the Administration wide latitude on its implementation   The Convention has been strongly supported by our nation in every war since the 1940s   It is there to protect our troops and we do not need to withdraw from its terms and conditions to win the current and future wars        Conclusion      While I agree with President Bush on the vast majority of the provisions in the legislation before the Congress establishing military tribunals  we do have some differences   The 10 percent we disagree on involves significant areas that could determine whether our work product is declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court           If these issues are not resolved in an appropriate manner  we could also place our troops serving abroad in unnecessary jeopardy for future wars   I stand ready  willing and able to bridge the handful of differences we have   I know our American troops  those who lost loved ones on 9 11 and in the global War on Terror  are counting on us to get it right this time                                                                        September 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
