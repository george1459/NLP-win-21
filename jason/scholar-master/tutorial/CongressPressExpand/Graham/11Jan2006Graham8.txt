                 Date  01 11 2006  Second Round of Graham Questioning Judge Alito                                                                                                                                                                                                                           SPECTER  Thank you  Senator Feingold       Senator Graham       GRAHAM  Thank you  Mr  Chairman       Judge Alito  maybe we could continue with the Vanguard issue just for a moment  And I know you ve been asked every conceivable combination of questions       But Senator Feingold is very sincere about ethics in government  He practices what he preaches and he s been one of the leaders of trying to make this place operate better       And my impression of you is that you re a good model for judges in terms of ethical conduct  based on what everybody says who knows you  I mean  I don t claim to be a close associate of yours  but the ABA has looked at this and said that it did not reflect poorly on you       Three hundred lawyers and judges who know you have said that you re just  really  sort of  what we want in a judge  And maybe that s not enough  but that s a pretty good start       I don t think you could get 300 people to say that about me or some of us  But the question I have    the criminal prosecutor or lawyer in me has this question to ask    why would you make a conscious decision not to recuse yourself       Why would Judge Alito sit down in the corner of a room and say  I think I ve got a conflict  but I m just going to let it go and hear the case anyway       I am baffled as to why you would make a conscious decision in this situation not to recuse yourself  Do you have an explanation       ALITO  There s no reason why I would make such a conscious decision  I had nothing whatsoever to gain by participating in this case and nobody has suggested that I did       This case involved some thousands of dollars  Vanguard manages billions of dollars of funds  The idea that the outcome of this case could have some effect on the mutual funds that I hold is beyond preposterous  and I don t understand anybody to have suggested anything like that       GRAHAM  Well  I ve been asking myself that question quietly  What is in it for this guy  Why would he bring all this grief upon himself consciously  Is it to intentionally break a promise to the Senate so you d go through hell for three days  I don t think so   LAUGHTER       So I m going to accept you at your word  like the ABA  and I m going to move on  And I don t know if anybody else will       Now  your days at Princeton  The more I know about Princeton  it s an interesting place   LAUGHTER       What is an eating society       ALITO  The eating clubs are privately owned facilities that upper classmen join for the purpose of taking their meals  The first two years  when I was there    the situation is now a bit more diversified as far as eating is concerned    but when I was there  and traditionally the freshmen and sophomores ate in university dining halls  And then  as juniors and seniors  they had to find other places to eat  and these were private facilities       GRAHAM  What is a selective eating society       ALITO  It s one where you apply to be a member  like a fraternity  and you go through a process that is somewhat similar to that  and they select you if they like you       GRAHAM  Were you a member of a selective eating society        ALITO  No  I was not       GRAHAM  Did people not like you or you just didn t apply   LAUGHTER       ALITO  I didn t apply       GRAHAM  Well  let me tell you who did apply  Donald Rumsfeld was a member of a selective eating society at Princeton  And that s an interesting comment  I thought  Woodrow Wilson  Jim Leach  good friend of mine over in the House       Mitch Daniels  the governor of Indiana  was a member of a nonselective eating society  Senator Claiborne Pell was a member of nonselective eating societies       And other Princeton alumni who are members of Congress could not verify their participation or lack thereof in eating clubs  including Senator Sarbanes  Bond  Frist and Representative Marshall       And I promise you I ll get to the bottom of that before this is all done   LAUGHTER       Now  this organization that was mentioned very prominently earlier in the day  did you ever write an article for this organization       ALITO  No  I did not       GRAHAM  OK       And some quotes were shown  from people who did write for this organization  that you disavowed  Do you remember that exchange       ALITO  I disavow them  I deplore them  They represent things that I have always stood against and I can t express too strongly         GRAHAM  If you don t mind the suspicious nature that I have is that you may be saying that because you want to get on the Supreme Court  that you re disavowing this now because it doesn t look good       And really what I would look at to believe you re not    and I m going to be very honest with you    is  How have you lived your life  Are you really a closet bigot       ALITO  I m not any kind of a bigot  I m not       GRAHAM  No  sir  you re not  And you know why I believe that  Not because you just said it    but that s a good enough reason  because you seem to be a decent  honorable man  I have got reams of quotes from people who have worked with you  African American judges    I ve lost my quotes       Judge Higginbotham    I don t know where they re at  But glowing quotes about who you are  the way you ve lived your life  law clerks  men and women  black and white  your colleagues who say that Sam Alito  whether I agree with him or not  is a really good man       You know why I believe you when you say that you disavow those quotes  Because the way you have lived your life and the way you and your wife are raising your children       Let me tell you this  Guilt by association is going to drive good men and women away from wanting to sit where you re sitting  And we re going to go through a bit of this ourselves as congressmen and senators       People are going to take a fact that we got a campaign donation from somebody who s found out to be a little different than we thought they were    and our political opponent s going to say  Aha  I got you       And we re going to say  Wait a minute  I didn t know that  I didn t take the money for that reason       And you know what  I m going to believe these senators and congressmen for the most part  because that s the way we do our business  We meet people here every day  We have photos taken with people    and sometimes you wish you didn t have your photo taken       But that doesn t mean that you re a bad person because of that association       Judge Alito  I am sorry that you ve had to go through this  I am sorry that your family has had to sit here and listen to this       Now let s talk about another time not so long ago    and another judge and some of her writings    and see if the Senate is changing for the better or for the worse       GRAHAM  Justice Ginsburg  who I need to go have a cup of coffee with because I constantly bring her up and I do not dislike the lady  I admire her       But let s put it bluntly  under today s environment  from a conservative s point of view  she would have a very hard time because Justice Ginsburg was the general counsel for the ACLU from 1973 to 1980       And if you want me to tar somebody by their association  I can put up some pretty wild cases from my point of view where she was involved       But you know what  I respect her because her job as an attorney for the ACLU is to represent the most unpopular causes       And as far as I can tell during her time with the ACLU  she was honest  she was ethical and she fought for the most unpopular causes  And  for that  I respect her       But you ve put some things down on an application about your view of the law in Roe v  Wade and it s taking an unbelievable effort on your part  I think  to convince people that  when I was a lawyer  I did this  when I applied for a job  I was doing this  and as a judge  I will do this       Here is what Justice Ginsburg said in an article she wrote titled  Some Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relationship to Roe v  Wade       The conflict  however  is not simply one between a fetus  interest and a woman s interest narrowly conceived  nor is the overriding issue state versus private control of a woman s body for a span of nine months  Also  in the balance is a woman s autonomous charge of her full life s course  her ability to stand in relation to men  society and to stay as an independent  self sustaining equal citizen       She wrote further  As long as the government paid for childbirth  the argument proceeded public funding could not be denied for abortion  often a safer and always a far less expensive course short and long term  By paying for childbirth but not abortion  the government increased spending and intruded upon or steered a choice Roe had ranked as a woman s fundamental right       The public funding of abortion decisions denying a requirement of public funding appear incongruous following so soon after the intrepid 1973 ruling  The court did not adequately explain why the fundamental choice  principle and trimester approach  embraced in Roe did not bar the sovereign at least at the pre viability stage of pregnancy from taking sides and being required to provide funding for the abortions of poor women       If that writing doesn t suggest an allegiance to Roe  that writing doesn t suggest from her point of view as the author of that article not only is Roe an important constitutional right  that government ought to pay for abortions in certain circumstances       GRAHAM  If she were here today and a Democratic president had nominated her and we take on the role that our colleagues are playing against you  not only would she not have gotten 96 votes  I think she would have been in for a very rough experience       And what s changed  Justice Ginsburg openly expressed a legal theory about Roe v  Wade  My question to you  If I am arguing a case that would alter Roe v  Wade  would I have the ability because of her prior writings to ask her to recuse herself based on those writings alone       ALITO  I don t think you would  Senator  I think it is established that prior writings of a member of the judiciary do not require the recusal of that member of the judiciary       GRAHAM  I think you re absolutely right  Judge  And let me tell you what she said at the hearing when it was her time to sit where you re sitting  You ask me about my thinking on equal protection versus individual autonomy  My answer is that both are implicated  The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman s life  to her well being and dignity  It is a decision that she must make for herself  When government controls that decision for her  she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices       A sentiment I think our pro choice colleagues share  a sentiment that I disagree with because I think the decision does affect humanity  and that s the unborn child       I don t question her religion  I don t question her patriotism  She gave an answer that was very honest and was very direct       And pro life Republicans and pro life Democrats never thought about disqualifying her  She didn t go through what you went through  Pro life Republicans and pro life Democrats set her comment aside and judged her based on her whole record and believed she was worthy to sit on the Supreme Court and she got 96 votes       And what you ve said in your writings about the other side of the issue pales in comparison to what she said before she came to this body  I don t know how many votes you re going to get  You re going to get confirmed  And it s not going to be 96  Judge Roberts got 78  and I m afraid to say that you re probably going to get less       To my colleagues  I know abortion is important  It s important to me  It s important to you  I know it s an important  central concept in our jurisprudence  But we can t build a judiciary around that one issue       GRAHAM  We can t make judges pledge allegiance to one case  We can t expect them to do things that would destroy their independence  You can vote yes  you can vote no  you can use any reason you would like       I just beg my colleagues  Let s don t go down a road that the country can t sustain and the judiciary will not be able to tolerate       People set aside her writings  set aside her candid statement and gave her the benefit of the doubt that she would apply the law when her time came  She replaced Justice White       We knew that that vote was going to change  I don t think any Republican had any doubt that  if there was a Roe v  Wade issue  she would vote differently than Justice White  But you never know       The one thing I can tell the public about you and John Roberts is that you re first round NFL draft picks  but I don t know what you re going to do 10 or 20 years from now because I think you are men of great integrity       And I may be very well disappointed in some of your legal reasoning  but I ll never be disappointed in you if you do your job as you see fit       The last thing I m going to read    do you know Cathy Fleming       ALITO  I do  She was an attorney and supervisor in the U S  Attorney s office in New Jersey       GRAHAM  Did you ask her to write a letter on your behalf       ALITO  I did not  no       GRAHAM  Judge Alito did not ask me to write this letter  I volunteered   LAUGHTER   I m glad you said that  by the way   LAUGHTER      I m a lifelong Democrat  I am the president elect of a national women s bar association  I chaired the corporate integrity and the white collar crime group at a national law firm  I do not speak on behalf of either my law firm or the women s bar association  I speak for myself only  But  by providing my credentials as an outspoken women s rights advocate and liberal minded criminal defense attorney  I hope you will appreciate the significance of my unqualified and enthusiastic recommendation of Sam Alito for the Supreme Court       Sam possesses the best qualities for judges  He s thoughtful  he s brilliant  he s measured  he s serious  and he s conscious of the awesome responsibilities imposed by his position       I cannot think of better qualities for a Supreme Court justice  It is my fervent hope that politics will not prevent this extraordinary  capable candidate from serving as associate justice on the United States Supreme Court       GRAHAM  I share her hope       Thank you  I yield back my time                                                       January 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
