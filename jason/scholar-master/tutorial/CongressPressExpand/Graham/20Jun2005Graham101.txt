Carolina  and U S  Representative Bob Inglis  R South Carolina  today held a press conference to recognize the leading role South Carolina plays in hydrogen research and to call for passage of President Bush  s energy bill          South Carolina is a leader in hydrogen research     said Graham     Research institutions across the state have recognized the impact hydrogen fuel technology could have on our future   Working together  they will help lead our state and nation into the next generation of fuel technology            Smart cars and fuels of the future will come only from successful collaboration with capable partners   Inglis said   Here in South Carolina we   Clemson  USC and State   the Upstate  Midlands and Lowcountry   must work in common cause         Graham recently hosted a meeting in Washington to bring together South Carolina  s leaders in hydrogen to discuss collaboration   The goal of the meeting was to help ensure everyone is working together to further the state  s image as a leading research location        Members of South Carolina  s Congressional delegation were in attendance along with representatives from       University of South Carolina  The only university designated by the National Science Foundation for fuel cell research          Clemson University  Leader in the development of ICAR  along with BMW          South Carolina State University  Home of the Clyburn Transportation Center          Savannah River National Lab  Home of the Center for Hydrogen Research  SRS has 50  years of experience in handling hydrogen and is positioned to be a national leader in a hydrogen economy         South Carolina has positioned itself well to be a major beneficiary of President Bush  s energy bill     said Graham     This bill contains nearly  4 billion for hydrogen research   It is the most aggressive hydrogen fuel development package in our nation  s history           As Co Chairman and founder of the Senate Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Caucus  Graham noted the hydrogen section of the energy bill is based largely on legislation he introduced with Senator Byron Dorgan  D North Dakota    That bill was the result of work done by the bipartisan caucus        The energy bill provides  3 8 billion for hydrogen and fuel cell funding over five years  including  1 1 billion specifically for hydrogen supply research projects   In addition  it establishes demonstration programs for hydrogen technologies and fuel cell vehicles for light duty and heavy duty vehicles  calls for enhanced public education and research efforts  and provides for private sector coordination        The bill sets a goal for the private sector of making a decision about the commercialization potential of hydrogen fuel by 2015          This energy bill has great potential for the future of South Carolina and the nation     said Graham     Working with Congressman Inglis and our entire delegation  it is my goal to make South Carolina the Detroit of hydrogen   Passing this bill will go a long way toward achieving that                                                                     June 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
