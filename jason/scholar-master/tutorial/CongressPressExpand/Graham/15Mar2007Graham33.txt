                                                                                                                                                                                                 MEGYN KENDALL  FOX HOST    If he is telling the truth  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was planning a truly devastating series of attacks when he was arrested back in 2003       According to him  he was plotting to destroy the Empire State Building  the New York Stock Exchange and the Panama Canal   He also says he was trying to kill presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter  as well as Pope John Paul II   But can these claims be believed       Republican Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina joins us now live from Capitol Hill       Hello  Senator   Thanks for being with us         LINDSEY GRAHAM     Good morning         KENDALL     OK   So here s the first question   Can these claims be believed         GRAHAM     I think we can believe the claim about 9 11   I can assure you that happened  and everybody in America knows it happened and the families know it happened       He listed a long list of terror enterprises that go back over a decade   Yes  I think we can believe that he considers us the enemy  that he considers anyone who disagrees with him religiously the enemy       I think we would be stupid not to believe that we re at war with these people   He is not a criminal  he s a warrior who s committed criminal acts   He should be treated as an enemy combatant  someone who s at war with the United States       And if we don t believe Al Qaida and their agenda  we do so at our own peril   It s time to wake up and realize that we are in a global war   They ve been at war with us a lot longer than we ve been at war with them  and we need to get with it and win this war       And he s in the right place    a military prison   He should never be in a federal court or a federal civilian prison   He needs to be in a military court and a military prison      KENDALL     Senator  do you see this    I mean  if you actually believe that he was planning on committing all of these atrocities  I mean  is this  is this    what kind of a testament is this to the efforts of U S  intelligence and anti terror forces         GRAHAM     The only thing that one would question    is he trying to embellish his role in Islamic jihadist history   I do believe that the details he s provided us will be corroborated       What it tells us    that he has been at war with us and the Al Qaida network has been at war with us for a decade   And what did they say will happen next   They want to win in Iraq  drive us not just out of Iraq  but the Mideast  topple every moderate government in the Mideast   Set up a religious theocracy cruel in nature in Baghdad in the Iraq region and eventually destroy Israel       So this should be a wake up call   We should understand that the intelligence agents who have captured this man  the military members who are detaining him  are doing us a great service  that we need the ability to interrogate in an effective manner people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed   And they ought to be in a military prison  not a civilian prison      KENDALL     Right   And on that score    I mean  obviously  these admissions were made in the context of him defending his label of being an enemy combatant  and now the next step is a trial       What now for him   What do you expect is going to happen to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed now         GRAHAM     I think that based on the record that there will be a solid case that he is an enemy combatant  not a common criminal  but somebody who s at war with the United States  who has planed attacks against the United States in a military fashion with a military objective  who operates out of uniform  that the definition of enemy combatant used at Guantanamo Bay fits him to a tee       And the next thing awaiting him would be a war crimes trial  because the activity that he has confessed to is illegal activity under the law of armed conflict       I ve been a military lawyer for 20 something years   We re at war  and the body of law we should apply to these people is the law of armed conflict  not domestic criminal law   So I expect him to be tried         KENDALL     It s pretty amazing that somebody like that in the United States of America gets even those rights  right  Senator       Thanks so much for being with us this morning         GRAHAM     Thank you                                                            March 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
