leadership   I ve really enjoyed being on this committee and you ve made it a real pleasure to serve here          Dr  Gates  thank you for your willingness to serve   It looks like we re going to be working together for at least a couple more years   Things are going pretty well for you right now   Iran  do you believe the Iranians are trying to acquire lethal weapons capability      ROBERT GATES     Yes  sir  I do         GRAHAM     Do you think the president of Iran is lying when he says he s not      GATES     Yes  sir         GRAHAM     Do you believe the Iranians would consider using that nuclear weapons capability against the nation of Israel         GATES     I don t know that they would do that  Senator   I think that the risks for them  obviously  are enormously high   I think that they see value         GRAHAM     If I may      GATES     Yes  sir      GRAHAM     The president of Iran has publicly disavowed the existence of the Holocaust  has publicly stated that he would like to wipe Israel off the map   Do you think he s kidding      GATES     No  I don t think he s kidding  but I think there are  in fact  higher powers in Iran than he  than the president   And I think that  while they are certainly pressing  in my opinion  for nuclear capability  I think that they would see it in the first instance as a deterrent          They are surrounded by powers with nuclear weapons   Pakistan to their east  the Russians to the north  the Israelis to the west and us in the Persian Gulf         GRAHAM     Can you assure the Israelis that they will not attack Israel with a nuclear weapon if they acquire one      GATES     No  sir  I don t think that anybody can provide that assurance      GRAHAM     Is Iraq the central battlefront in the war on terror      GATES     I think that it is one of the central fronts in the war on terror      GRAHAM     What would be the others         GATES     I think that what we have seen since the destruction of Afghanistan or since the destruction of the Taliban regime is a metastasized terror threat from the jihadists  where indigenous radicals in countries like Britain  like Spain and like the United States are in fact planning terrorists operations and activities       So I think that while Iraq certainly is an important front in the war on terror and particularly now that all these other bad actors are there that I indicated    described earlier    I think we face a more disbursed threat that s really a very amorphous kind of second front         GRAHAM     Would a loss in Iraq in terms of a failed state affect the war on terror         GATES     I think it would create the conditions where you could have a replication of what happened in Afghanistan  and yes  it could be         GRAHAM     Why is Al Qaida in Iraq   What do they fear   Why are they fighting in Iraq   What is their goal         GATES     I m no expert on it  Senator  but I believe that they would    they are very eager to see us leave the region    not just Iraq  but leave the region        GRAHAM     Are they threatened by democracy      GATES     Absolutely         GRAHAM     Is it the terrorists  worst nightmare for a democratic state to be formed in Iraq where a woman can have her say about her children and people of religious differences can live together under the rule of law        GATES     I certainly hope it s one of their worst nightmares        GRAHAM     Well  according to them  it is         Now  do you believe the terrorist Al Qaida goal and other terrorist organizations  to expand on what you said  includes not only driving us out of Iraq but the region        GATES     Yes  sir        GRAHAM     Do you believe it includes toppling of all moderate regimes in the region        GATES     Yes  sir        GRAHAM     All regimes that are unfaithful to their view of religion      GATES     Yes  sir      GRAHAM     Do you believe it is the ultimate destruction of the state of Israel        GATES     Yes  sir        GRAHAM     Do you believe in the Powell doctrine      GATES    I am very familiar with it  and I would say        GRAHAM     Do you believe in it or not        GATES     Well  sir there are different    there are eight elements to the Powell doctrine      GRAHAM     Well  let me sum up the one   You go to war with overwhelming force        GATES     Yes  sir        GRAHAM     Do you believe we have the overwhelming force we need to do all the missions required of us to bring about a democracy in Iraq at this point in time        GATES     I need to talk to the commanders to find that out        GRAHAM     The jobs assigned to the military leadership commanders would include  do you agree  eventually trying to disarm the militia because you can t have a democracy with armed religious and political parties        GATES     Yes  sir        GRAHAM     Do you also believe it includes training the Iraqi army        GATES     Yes  sir        GRAHAM     Do you believe it includes rebuilding the police force  because I think it s a miserable failure and we need to start over  virtually        GATES     It s not entirely clear to me  Senator  that that should be the responsibility of the Department of Defense   But we have    as best I can tell  the department has that responsibility now         GRAHAM     To provide security for economic development    40 percent of all money spent on economic development projects now are security related   That would be one mission of a military commander in Iraq  to give security to the economic development  to get this country up and running      GATES     Yes  sir         GRAHAM     Is there any doubt in your mind that the current level of troops are overwhelming when it comes to fulfilling all those missions  including defeating the insurgents   Could you honestly tell this committee and this country that the number of troops we have to do all the jobs I ve described  including defeating the insurgents  is overwhelming      GATES     No  sir  I do not believe it is overwhelming         GRAHAM     If we redeploy to a friendly country  under these circumstances  do you think it s likely that the terrorist organizations that we ve just talked about would come after us in that country  trying to prove to the American people there is no safe place for you in this region         GATES     Probably so         GRAHAM     Do you believe  if we set timetables or a policy to withdraw at a date certain  it would be seen by the extremists as a sign of weakness  the moderates would be disheartened and it would create a tremendous impediment to the moderate forces coming forward in Iraq      GATES     I think a specific timetable would give    would essentially tell them how long they have to wait until we re gone      GRAHAM     Thank you                                                         December 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
