of WRDA Bill Authorizes More Than  76 Million for 1st District Projects WASHINGTON    Today  Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 which will provide for significant improvements to our nations water resources and water infrastructure  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Henry E  Brown  Jr   voted with a strong bipartisan majority to pass this critically important legislation  Brown was a member of the Conference Committee tasked with reconciling the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill  The bill authorizes more than  76 million for infrastructure projects in  Charleston  and the Grand Strand     After many years of work on this bill  I was pleased to see this legislation take another critical step towards becoming law  said Brown  Working with my colleagues in the House and Senate  we were able to work out a compromise plan that both houses can agree to  as well as provide for necessary projects for coastal  South Carolina   Improving infrastructure is not a partisan issue  it is a commitment we as a nation must ensure is met  and I was pleased to see such strong bipartisan support for this bill  I want to thank Senator Graham for his efforts in support of this legislation      The  South Carolina  projects authorized in this bill are much needed to promote health  safety  and economic development  said Graham  I appreciate Congressman Browns leadership in shepherding these meritorious projects through the House  There is still much work to be done in the authorization and appropriation process  We must create a system that allows transparency and reduces the ability of lawmakers to subvert the open process and slip wasteful spending into worthwhile bills  I am proud of the funding Congressman Brown and I have secured  and ask my colleagues to publicly stand by their projects as well        Included in the Conference Report were several projects sought by local communities to give the Army Corps the tools to improve the environment  conduct critical drainage improvements  and reduce coastal storm damage throughout the Grand Strand and Charleston Regions  The efforts of Congressman Brown and Senator Graham resulted in increased authorization levels for these projects       18 million to accelerate the continued installation of ocean outfalls in Myrtle Beach  As part of the Citys Pavilion Master Plan  an ocean outfall system for Myrtle Beach will retain  clean  and then discharge storm water offshore  replacing the current system  which dumps untreated storm water directly onto the beach  The City has already invested  15 million into this project            16 million to continue progress on replacement of the  Charleston  Wastewater Tunnels  For several years  the Charleston Water System has been conducting a phased replacement of the citys wastewater carrier tunnels  These nearly 40 year old structures lying beneath the city and the harbor were deteriorating at a rapid pace  putting the entire region under the risk of a severe environmental disaster  given that the tunnel system carries over 10 million gallons of wastewater on a daily basis  While largely financed by the Water System  the federal support authorized in this legislation will assist with efforts to move ahead with Phase II of the project  which involves replacing portions of the       Cooper River       and Ashley River Tunnels in Downtown Charleston            16 44 million to support storm damage reduction and beach renourishment in      Pawleys Island   Funds authorized under this project will allow for the construction of a 6 800 foot sand berm along the southern reach of       Pawleys Island         This will have a significant impact on reducing future hurricane and storm damage to the surrounding beach and community  Additionally  the project provides for a 50 year commitment by the Federal government to provide for beach renourishment        11 million towards efforts by      North Myrtle Beach      to replace its current stormwater drainage system with a system of ocean outfalls  The ocean outfall system will ensure that swimmers do not come into contact with dangerous bacteria and will assist with efforts to reduce flooding and beach renourishment needs by carrying rainfall runoff to a point offshore  Federal support for this project follows  12 million in local investment by      North Myrtle Beach                  11 million for ocean outfalls projects in       Surfside Beach    Included in this authorization is critical support for efforts by the Town of Surfside Beach to replace an existing ocean outfall  including construction of a new headwall and weir  The replacement of this outfall  along with efforts by the town to expand its existing outfall system  are strategic for ensuring that the Town continues its past history of meeting water quality mandates before they are required            4 million to allow the City of Charleston to move forward with the Spring  Street Fishburne Street  Drainage Project  The Spring Street Fishburne Street drainage basin encompasses approximately 500 acres  or about twenty percent of the  Charleston  peninsula and is traversed by U S  Highway 17  which due to current conditions can be made impassable to passenger vehicles by moderate rainfall          A modern and well functioning infrastructure is a key component to economic development  and serves to protect our health and safety  said Graham  Projects authorized in this bill are critical to protecting the health and well being of people in  South Carolina  and throughout the country     Each of these projects is critical to protecting the environment and ensuring the safety of the entire region  said Representative Brown  a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in the House  While this bill does not on its own provide funding  it ensures that these projects will be on the list of priorities for the U S  Army Corps of Engineers                                                                    September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
