Approves Comprehensive Immigration Reform                                                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today said the Senate Judiciary Committee has completed its work on comprehensive immigration reform   The vote in committee was 12 6 with Graham voting in support        The Committee had completed work on the sections of the bill toughening protection of the border making it tougher for illegal immigrants to enter the United States   Today  the committee worked on how to handle the estimated eleven million illegal immigrants currently in the United States          The Senate  s first step in comprehensive immigration reform was to physically tighten protection of the southern border     said Graham     In committee  we have created a virtual fence along parts of our southern border which relies on cameras  motion detectors and other technological devices to keep people from entering the United States illegally   While many issues surrounding immigration reform are contentious  there is broad agreement among Republicans and Democrats that maintaining the status quo along the southern border is simply unacceptable            Graham expressed support for a real fence where practical  It would be similar to the San Diego Border Fence  a state of the art nearly impenetrable barrier which made illegal entry into our nation much more difficult   The San Diego area was once a haven for illegal crossings but the Border Fence nearly stopped the flood of border crossings from Mexico into the area   Unfortunately  there is not enough support in the Senate Judiciary Committee for construction of a Border Fence          Today we moved on to the next phase of immigration reform and that  s what to do with the estimated eleven million immigrants who are already in the United States     said Graham     We have to come to grips with the fact that we have eleven million undocumented people in the country right now   The idea of telling them to go home and come back later is unrealistic   It would also cost  40 billion a year to deport all illegal immigrants currently in the United States             The guest worker program which passed the committee would allow immigrants to come out of the shadows  undergo a comprehensive background check  pay a fine  pay their back taxes  and then work in the United States     said Graham     It  s a process which will make our nation more secure by helping kick out the bad apples  allowing those who wish to work to continue doing so and benefit our national economy           The process for an immigrant who entered the country illegally to continue working includes an assortment of fines  background checks  employment verification  and education in civics and English          Amnesty grants immigrants immediate citizenship and that  s why I oppose amnesty     said Graham     Anyone trying to become a citizen under the guest worker program must meet very strict criteria over an eleven year period   Ronald Reagan  one of our greatest presidents  tried amnesty and it failed   We should not repeat that mistake             To receive a work visa  illegal immigrants would be forced to        1  Register with the government or face deportation           2  Pay a  1 000 fine           3  Undergo an extensive and comprehensive background check to ensure they do not have a criminal record or pose a danger to society           4  Show proof of employment           5  Continue to remain employed while in the United States   Lack of employment longer than 45 days results in deportation           After six years of work in the United States  they could apply for a second five year extension   Immigrants would be forced to        6  Pay another  1 000 fine           7  Undergo a second comprehensive background check to ensure they do not have a criminal record or pose a danger to society           8  Pay any back taxes           9  Attend a class on American civics           10  Learn to speak English           11  Upon completion of these requirements  they would go to the back of the line to apply for permanent resident alien status           12  After another five years  a total of 11 years after first registering  they would be eligible to apply to become an American citizen           Graham noted that while President Bush has not endorsed a specific guest worker plan  the proposal passed by the committee today is similar to what the President has discussed          In some ways  we  re hypocritical as a nation     said Graham     We want the benefit of the labor  but we haven  t come to grips with how they should be allowed into the country   There are many industries in South Carolina and across the country which are dependent upon this workforce                        Immigration Reform and a Guest Worker Program   Question    Is this amnesty       Answer    No   An amnesty proposal would grant illegal immigrants an automatic pardon and put on the fast track to citizenship   On the contrary  this reform penalizes them for coming to the United States illegally        The bill requires undocumented workers to come forward and register with the government  They will be required to pay a substantial fine   a total of  2 000    to participate in the temporary worker program  They will have to meet a prospective work requirement    six more years on the job    before they can apply for a permanent visa  Only those who can prove that they are learning English and who have gone through rigorous criminal background checks and security screenings will be permitted to apply  No one will be granted automatic permanent resident status  nor will they permitted to   jump the line    ahead of those who are waiting to enter through a legal process   In fact  they will be sent to the back of the line        Question    Why do we need a guest worker program       Answer    Our broken immigration system doesn  t work  The current immigration system provides so few legal channels for foreign workers that it all but guarantees an illegal flow  Businesses can  t find the labor they need forcing entire industries to operate on the wrong side of the law  Millions of foreign workers live in the country illegally today   It  s a nightmare for them  an affront to the rule of law and an unacceptable security risk for all Americans         Question    Will a guest worker proposal enhance our national security       Answer    A guest worker program enhances security within the United States by encouraging millions of currently undocumented workers to come forward and register with the government  Registering will help shrink and eventually eliminate the undocumented population   This will help dry up the smuggling trade and put document forgers out of business   In the process it also deprives would be terrorists of the illegal support system they could exploit in immigrant communities       Question    Don  t temporary or guest workers undercut American workers by taking their jobs        Answer     No  As study after study of the labor market shows  American workers don  t generally compete with immigrants    they don  t generally want the low paying  low skilled jobs that immigrant workers come to fill  Our native born work force is getting older and our birth rates are falling  As a nation we are more and more educated  In 1960  half of all American men dropped out of high school and went into the unskilled labor force  Today only 10 percent of the native born drop out  And few American families now raise their children to be busboys or to work out in the fields          Furthermore  the comprehensive immigration reform before the Senate Judiciary Committee includes a variety of measures designed to protect U S  workers         The legislation mandates that employers who are considering hiring an immigrant worker must first try to hire a U S  worker  advertising all available jobs for two weeks on an electronic job registry  That registry will be accessible on the web to an interested U S  worker  and the Department of Labor will circulate it to public employment services across the country  After three years    and every three years after that   employers will also be required to re advertise the jobs held by temporary workers  guaranteeing that immigrants are not displacing Americans who are qualified and available to fill the same jobs         Finally  employers will be prohibited from hiring foreigners to replace striking workers or those who have been recently fired       Question    Won  t a guest worker program lead to more illegal immigration        Answer    No  The goal of the bill is to replace the current illegal flow with legal workers by giving the foreign workers our economy needs a safe  orderly  legal way to enter the country  Once every available job is filled by an authorized worker  and it is impossible    as it will be under this program    to get work without a valid visa  there will be much less incentive for other migrants to cross the border illegally  Far fewer employers will need to resort to illegal workers  and those who do    the truly unscrupulous  exploitative minority    can be targeted with enforcement and tough new penalties                                                                    March 2006 Press Releases
