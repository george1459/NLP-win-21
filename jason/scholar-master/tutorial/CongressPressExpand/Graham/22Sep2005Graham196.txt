                 Date  09 22 2005  Lindsey Graham Statement on Senate Judiciary Committee Vote on John Roberts Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                   Thank you  Mr  Chairman   One  I hope Senator Feingold has a long life and he sees many      Supreme Court justices come and go          If I can do what my predecessor did  Senator Feingold  I have 50 more years to serve   LAUGHTER   So this court will flip over four or five times   And I m going to miss most of you all  by the way   LAUGHTER        Senator Biden gave me some good advice when I first came to the Senate   He was gracious enough to come down and speak at Senator Thurmond s funeral upon his passing   And I really do like Senator      Biden a lot        He said   Don t ever question a senator s motive   You can argue with their result  you can disagree with how they vote  but don t question their motive    You know  that s great advice   I am going to adopt that advice   I think that if you vote differently than I do  I don t question your motives        But I ll make an observation  too  for the long view of things  because I think Russ is on to something here   What we do here today is definitely going to affect the future          Just for a point of observation  Breyer and Ginsburg and Scalia  I ve been told  were reported out of the committee unanimously   Well  that s not going to happen today with Judge Roberts  but I m not questioning anyone s motives   It s just a fact        I think people have articulated very heart felt reasons for voting no and yes   And we re already talking about the next nominee in code   Senator Kohl  who voted yes  is talking about the balance of the court with O Connor   Senator Feingold has mentioned he may not be too receptive to Justice Brown   I can understand that  that s the way this situation is in 2005        But this is my first    hopefully of many    Supreme Court confirmation hearings  Mr  Chairman  and I think you ve done an excellent job        Senator Leahy  I think you ve done an excellent job as the ranking member   I ve been very proud of the committee   I ve at times refused to come over here because I hated to come  because we d argue about what time it is   I think the committee distinguished itself very well  I really do   I think the questions were hard  they were probing   And  generally speaking  I think the committee did well        The mystery is gone   I will vote for Judge Roberts   I m sure everybody was hanging on whether that would happen    LAUGHTER   But the reason I m going to vote for him is because I believe that the president does enjoy some deference here   That s what this debate is about right now   the role of the president versus the Senate        Senator Kennedy has articulated what he thought the central issue of the hearing was at the beginning and he concluded with his view of the central issue as whether or not the nominee would roll      back certain progress that he s seen in the law        I started out the central issue being whether or not the Senate will allow the president  President Bush  to fulfill a campaign promise he made to the American people  and that is to nominate a well qualified strict constructionist to the court        Two different views of what the Senate should be doing        He will get confirmed  thanks to people like Senator Kohl and Feingold and Senator Leahy and others   People who vote their conscience against him  they re doing what they think is right   But that is a basic issue the country needs to come to grips with        Senator Reid  when he was indicating that he would vote no  made a statement    The president is not entitled to very much deference in staffing the third branch of government  the judiciary    And The      Washington Post wrote an editorial called   Words That Will Haunt         I just want to  if I can  in a few minutes  talk about where we re going from here   He s going to be confirmed but the vote totals are going to be fairly dramatically different than they were with Ginsburg  Scalia and Breyer        If you get away from the qualifications  intelligence and character test  which I think had to be in play there  you re setting up a scenario that could haunt us all        If we re going to start looking at people s hearts  that is a very subjective thing to do   Justice Ginsburg    her writings  as Senator Grassley said   I admire him for voting because she is qualified but from a conservative s point of view  her view of politics and her writings and the role she played in the law was very hard to swallow         I would just say that one of the attacks on Judge Roberts was that he was a legal genius  well qualified  intellectually gifted  but we didn t know if he had the worldness of judging others  that he was qualified to really sit in judgment at that level   We re questioning whether or not he s lived his life right        Well  one could argue that if you re for a constitutional right of prostitution  those of us who have been in the criminal law as prosecutors and defense attorneys would probably come out different  that prostitution s not a good business endeavor  that those women who find themselves in the world of prostitution live in hell   We could start questioning whether or not someone who believed in that      view of a constitutional right really was connected to the real world as I see it        But  you know  the real world as Lindsey Graham sees it is    I m glad you don t adopt it   It would be a very boring place for the country        We all have different value systems and we all have different hot button items   If we start judging the nominee on   Will you show allegiance to what I think is most important in the country   then we re going to politicize the process to the point that I think the role of the president has been dramatically changed and undermined   Woe be on to those judges who have to figure out how to navigate our value systems  our beliefs and show allegiance to our heart        That is a standard I would not want to put on any of you   It s not a standard I want to put on anyone who s going to follow         So there is a fundamental shift in this nomination to  I think  what the standard has been in the past to what it will be in the future   I have a little bit of concern about that   Actually  I have a lot of concern        The reasons to vote no  while I respect those reasons  have been very subjective   They ve been around a case or a concept that you find so important that that s going to be the end of the discussion        I would just urge this committee  as we go to the next debate  to remember that Scalia was obviously conservative   There s no way Roberts is more conservative than Scalia   There s no way that      Roberts is more challenging and in you face than Scalia in his writings        Scalia got 98 votes   Now what s happened   Ginsberg got 96 votes   What s going on        I think Senator Grassley put his finger on it   There s a lot of pressure on us all   This is the easiest vote a Republican will ever make   This is so easy for us to vote for Roberts        It is not easy for you  Russ   I know you are a prominent player in the Democratic Party   This is not easy for Senator Leahy   It is not easy for Senator Kohl   It will not be easy for those who choose      to side with Roberts because they re trying to drive down the vote numbers because of the next person to come        Senator Grassley  you re right   Politics is rearing its head like it has not done before   But here s what I worry about  sir   Our day will come   There will be a Democratic president  probably in      my lifetime   LAUGHTER   The pressure that they re feeling  we re going to feel          The compromise    Senator DeWine and I felt a little bit of pressure    if we could look at the person before us based on qualifications  character and integrity and not require them to show an allegiance to a particular case or a cause  it would serve the country well   Because liberals and conservatives come and go  but the rule of law is bigger than all of our philosophies        The rule of law is about the process   If you want the law to be outcome determinative  then the process has been cheapened        The good thing about the law  Mr  Chairman  is that the conservative and liberal philosophy and agenda is parked at the courthouse door and we re judged by facts and what people did before      us        There needs to be one place left in American discourse and politics for the quietness of the merits of individuals to trump the loudness of special interest groups   The last place I know of is the courtroom        The reason that I think Justice Roberts will be a justice for the ages    he s probably the most qualified guy  top two or three people in the history of the nation    is that he believes beyond anything else that the rule of law is for the unpopular cause  is for the quiet discussion not the loud political campaign  and that he believes deep down and loves the law more than he loves politics        That s all you can ask of anybody that comes through our gatekeeping here   Will you adhere to the law more than you ll adhere to anyone s political philosophy        The president has chosen well        Mr  President  you have done a good service to this nation by choosing someone of such intellect and character who will serve this nation for a long period of time        You have another choice awaiting you   Listen to our Democratic colleagues   Listen to what we have to say   But at the end of the day  ask you to do one thing for the good of your presidency and all      to follow   Fulfill your campaign promise of selecting a strict constructionist  well qualified person who loves the law more than they love politics        Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                         September 2005 Press
