Opposes Omnibus Spending Legislation Supports McConnell Amendment Providing  70 Billion in Funding for Troops in Iraq    WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  last night voted against the 3 417 page   550 billion omnibus spending bill to fund the federal government  The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 76 17 and awaits action by the House of Representatives  President Bush is expected to sign it into law if it reaches his desk  Simply put  the downside was greater than the upside  said Graham  After careful consideration I came to the conclusion there were some worthwhile provisions  but just not enough to justify a vote in support   Graham said changes in border security provisions and earmarking were major reasons for his no vote  Secure Fence Act Undermined by the Omnibus  Graham noted the omnibus made significant changes to the Secure Fence Act which was signed into law last year  Earlier this year  Graham secured  3 billion in emergency funding through the Graham Amendment for improved border security and additional border fencing as called for in the Secure Fence Act  The omnibus  while providing much of the funding sought in the Graham Amendment   2 7 billion   institutes bureaucratic and policy changes which will make it more difficult to actually construct the fence   Among the changes are removing requirements for double layer fencing and replacing it with single layer fencing  The omnibus also creates new bureaucratic hurdles including additional reporting requirements from the Department of Homeland Security and approval of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees before funds can be spent on the border fence  The legislation makes changes in the planned construction of the more than 700 miles of fencing along our southern border which are troubling said Graham  In the name of providing flexibility  I think we may end up slowing construction  I want funding for the fence and the ability to build the fence with limited interference   In the age of terrorism  regaining operational control of our nations borders is a national security issue of the highest order  said Graham  The term operational control is a military term  and I look at this effort to secure our border as a military operation  If we are serious about border security  our actions need to match our words  When it comes to securing our border  the omnibus does not accomplish those objectives   Earmarks Air Dropped into the Omnibus  Graham also expressed concern about the sheer number and manner in which some earmarks were included  The legislation contained over 9 000 earmarks  including 300 which were air dropped into the final legislation  Air dropping means these earmarks were not passed by either the House or Senate during previous consideration of spending bills  They also were not subject to a point of order  amendment or debate on the floor  or questioning of their merit   Earmarks are a legitimate way to ensure funding is included for projects important in our states  but the process must be clear  transparent  and not abused  said Graham  The omnibus did not meet that standard  The final legislation included several hundred earmarks which were air dropped into the legislation at the last possible minute  We can and must do better  Graham noted the positive aspects of the legislation including the overall spending number was less than previous versions and inclusion of the McConnell Amendment providing  70 billion in funding for operations in Iraq  The McConnell Amendment was a major victory for the Presidents policies in Iraq  said Graham  General Petraeus and all under his command have earned the right to continue pushing forward in Iraq  It would have been a huge mistake to withhold or not provide them funding  Our troops now have the funding they need without strings attached  Im pleased we passed the McConnell Amendment and also beat back several Democratic attempts to micromanage the Iraq war                                                              December 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
