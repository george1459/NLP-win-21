Delegations Announce MOX Agreement between U S  and Russia                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   This morning  the United States and Russia signed an agreement that formally resolves liability issues which delayed construction of the Mixed Oxide  MOX  Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site  SRS            In 2000  the U S  and Russia each agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus  weapons grade plutonium by turning it into MOX fuel for use in existing commercial nuclear reactors   The MOX program is the most cost effective manner for converting excess weapons grade plutonium into forms unusable for weapons by terrorists          Members of the South Carolina and Georgia delegations have worked tirelessly to overcome this hurdle   Having met with officials from the White House  the State Department  the Department of Energy  and the National Nuclear Security Administration the delegation made it clear that all the issues needed to be resolved so the program can move forward         The events of today are the result of a lot of hard work and dedication by my colleagues and me   said Congressman Gresham Barrett  R SC  3     This announcement is huge news for the MOX program  the Site  the state and the nation   It is further proof that the Administration joins the South Carolina and Georgia delegations in strong support of the MOX program  which is vital to our national security   I am confident that this news will alleviate any doubts that may exist in the minds of some as to the commitment behind the program   The agreement helps put all the pieces of the puzzle together and solves a major issue surrounding the delays in the MOX program   I look forward to working through the appropriation process to ensure that the US commitment is fulfilled            This is great news for the future of SRS and the United States   said U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R SC     The MOX program will play an essential national security role in the decades to come   I appreciate the dedication of the Bush Administration and the Department of State to see these negotiations through to the end   I appreciate the work of my congressional colleagues from South Carolina and Georgia for their efforts to keep this issue at the forefront   We remain committed to seeing the MOX program fully funded and operational          This roadblock being removed shows a strong commitment on the part of both countries to move forward   said U S  Senator Jim DeMint  R SC     I m going to continue to push for the U S  to fulfill its commitment and proceed with the funding of the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility          One of the reasons why the MOX facility is so important is that it will help both countries make great strides toward keeping weapons grade plutonium out of the hands of terrorists   said U S  Senator Saxby Chambliss  R GA     I know the hard working professionals at Savannah River Site are ready and able to start work on the facility as soon as possible          We have a world class facility in the Savannah River Site  and the agreement reached today is huge step forward   said U S  Senator Johnny Isakson   R GA    I am confident the Georgia and South Carolina delegations will continue to work hard to ensure that the MOX program is funded and operational as soon as possible          In reaching an agreement today with Russia  we have taken a vital step in moving the MOX program forward   Our commitment to waste cleanup at the Savannah River Site remains strong  and I am confident that today s news will aid our efforts to expedite construction of the MOX facility and secure future funding   said Congressman Joe Wilson  R SC  2          This clears the final hurdle for getting the MOX facility up and going at SRS   I look forward to immediately passing whatever additional measures are necessary to bring it to completion  This is a tremendous step forward for not just the CSRA  but the entire nation in national security  independence from foreign oil  and prevention of nuclear terrorism   said Congressman Charlie Norwood  R GA  9                                                                   September 2006 Press
