                                                  WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today introduced legislation in the U S  Senate creating the H Prize   The H Prize is meant to help overcome the technical challenges related to using hydrogen as a widely available and abundant fuel source by offering cash incentives          As a nation  we need to become less dependent on foreign oil     said Graham     It would be irresponsible if 50 years from now we  re still reliant on Middle Eastern oil to drive our national economy   We need to get away from fossil fuels and start looking at using different sources of energy such as hydrogen   The H Prize will help foster additional research and development in the long overdue effort to make hydrogen a significant source of our nation  s energy supply           Graham serves as the co chair of the Senate Hydrogen Caucus  along with Senator Byron Dorgan        D ND    Dorgan has signed on as the lead Democratic sponsor of the H Prize legislation in the Senate          Prices at the gas pump make plain that when it comes to how we use energy   yesterday forever   is not a strategy that works very well     said Dorgan     While fossil fuels will always be a part of our energy mix  developing new domestic sources of energy is more important today than it has ever been  The H Award will provide a powerful incentive for research and advancement in one of the most promising new areas on the horizon    developing hydrogen fuel cells and making them an integral part of our economy           Graham noted South Carolina is a national leader in hydrogen research   The University of South Carolina is developing hydrogen fuel cells  Clemson is working on hydrogen vehicles  Aiken County has established a Hydrogen Research Center  and the Savannah River Site is a leading research facility in hydrogen storage and technology   These groups and others recently united behind the South Carolina Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association which coordinates the state  s efforts to be a leading player in the emerging hydrogen economy        The H Prize is modeled on the Ansari X Prize which last year spurred the first privately funded suborbital human spaceflight   Yesterday  the U S  House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation by U S  Rep  Bob Inglis  R SC  and Dan Lipinski  D IL  creating the H Prize        Awards will be offered in the following categories       Technological Advancement   Four prizes of up to  1 million will be awarded every two years for outstanding achievements in the Production  Storage  Distribution  and Utilization of hydrogen          Prototypes   One prize of up to  4 million will be awarded every two years for working hydrogen vehicle prototypes that meets performance goals          Transformational Technology   Over the next ten years  a single  10 million prize funded by the federal government or private donations for breakthrough hydrogen technologies           The legislation directs the Secretary of Energy to contract with a private foundation or other non profit entity to establish criteria for the prizes and administer the prize contest            Hydrogen holds tremendous promise for the future     said Graham     The H Prize is an important step forward in the drive to help our nation become energy independent   I  m proud to be part of this effort in the Senate and appreciate the work done by Congressmen Inglis and Lipinski in creating incentives for the private sector to create hydrogen based vehicles   The H Prize is a clear signal from the federal government that we are interested and believe in a hydrogen based transportation economy   The H Prize puts our money where our mouth is             I  m proud to be the lead Senate co sponsor of legislation that will spark research and development that can take us to a more secure and stable energy future     concluded Dorgan        The passage into law last year of the Energy Bill contained more than  3 5 billion in funding over the next 5 years for hydrogen research   The hydrogen provisions in the bill were largely based upon language authored by Graham and Dorgan                                                                     May 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
