What is being said about Immigration Reform    News Editorial Page Editor Beth Padgett     on its face  the plan does what we on the editorial page    and many people who desperately want this issued solved    have demanded  It proposes ways to secure our borders  crack down on employers who hire illegals  make it tougher to hire illegals  And  yes  it proposes a common sense way to give legal status to most of those here illegally   Orangeburg Times  Democrat Editorial  Immigration Compromise is Realism  And extreme is what both sides advocate  The reality of deporting 12 million Mexicans is about as realistic a solution as simply opening the borders  Call it an amnesty program or not  there must be some kind of provision for allowing those in the country illegally to move toward citizenship  As impractical as trying to find and deport them is  it also would be devastating to the American economy      Continuing to oppose all efforts at compromise on immigration only makes it longer before there is agreement on how to secure our borders to stop the wave of immigrants from Mexico  Border security is as essential to dealing with the immigration crisis as is an answer to what to do about the illegals in the country now   Conservative Columnist Bob Novak   Immigration Trap for GOP Candidates  Why are the  Republican  party faithful throughout the country so incensed by immigration  When I asked  Lindsey  Graham  he quoted from a federal government report on the new arrivals to this country  largely unskilled laborers and heavily illiterate  The new immigration has provoked a widespread feeling of apprehension as to its effect on the economic and social welfare of the country  The report  by the U S  Immigration Commission  was dated 1911  When Graham returned to Washington Monday as the immigration debate began  he read the 96 year old quote into the Senate record to demonstrate that fear of foreigners is not new for Americans  This nation of immigrants has greeted successive waves of newcomers with apprehension stoked by demagogues  It has overcome such past xenophobic impulses  But that will be more difficult in an era of Internet bloggers and radio talkers        Wall Street Journal Editorial on  Immigration and Welfare  One place to start is a myth that has become a key talking point among restrictionists on the right    to wit  that immigrants come to the U S  for a life of ease on the public dole  Leading this charge is the Heritage Foundation s Robert Rector    Mr  Rector and Heritage have done some good social science research in the past  but this time they have the story backward  In most cases immigrants will pay at least as much in lifetime federal taxes as they receive in benefits  One basic flaw in the Heritage analysis is that  as a study by the Immigration Policy Center points out  The vast majority of immigrants are not eligible to receive any of these  welfare  benefits for many years after their arrival in the United States        Legal permanent residents cannot receive SSI  Supplemental Security Income   which is available only to U S  citizens  and are not eligible for means tested public benefits until 5 years after receiving their green cards   Conservative Columnist David Brooks of the New York Times The United States is the Harvard of the world  Millions long to get in  Yet has this country set up an admissions system that encourages hard work  responsibility and competition  No  Under our current immigration system  most people get into the U S  through criminality  nepotism or luck  The current system does almost nothing to encourage good behavior or maximize the nation s supply of human capital  Which is why the immigration deal reached in the Senate last week is  on balance  a good thing  It creates a new set of incentives for immigrants and potential immigrants  It encourages good behavior  in the manner of a demanding  though overly harsh  admissions officer  It rewards the bourgeois virtues that have always been at the heart of this nation s immigrant success  and goes some way to assure that the people who possess these virtues can become U S  citizens
