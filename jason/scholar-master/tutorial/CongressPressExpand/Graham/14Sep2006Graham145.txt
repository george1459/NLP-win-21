their request to Senate leadership for a vote on the Schumer Graham Free Trade Act  Last April  The Schumer Graham legislation received 67 votes on a procedural vote and is scheduled for an up or down vote before September 30th  Schumer and Graham  s letter today formally requests floor time by the end of this month          We  ve been very patient  but have seen little progress     Senator Schumer said    The Senate will be voting on our bill if China doesn  t make a significant move very soon   Time is running out  I hope that Hank returns with tangible results  but if the disconnect between China  s rhetoric and actions is any guide  we  ll have no choice but to call for a vote              Senator Schumer and I have been patient and flexible     said Senator Graham     We agreed to delay a vote on our legislation on three separate occasions   Most recently  in March we agreed to delay a vote for six additional months to give the Chinese additional time to revalue their currency   We have been determined and we have been reasonable   Now  the date of our promised vote is approaching and we are sorely disappointed with China  s pace of reform            The Schumer Graham Bill  S  295  allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the United States and China on currency revaluation  if the negotiations are not successful  a temporary across the board tariff of 27 5  will be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States  If the President certifies to Congress within 180 days of enactment that China has made a good faith effort to revalue its currency upward  he may delay the imposition of the tariffs for an additional 180 days  If at the end of that 180 day period the President determines that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  the President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an additional 12 months       The text of the letter is below     September 14  2006       The

20510       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid        We are writing to you today to formally request specific time for floor debate and a vote on our China currency legislation  S  295   The Senate committed to a vote under the unanimous consent agreement reached in April 2005  and the time has come for us to move forward on our bill        As you know  on April 6  2005  we offered the text of S  295 as an amendment to the State Department authorization bill   A motion was made to table our amendment  which failed by a 33 67 margin   Majorities of both parties  as well as majorities on both the Banking and Finance committees  voted against the tabling motion        At the time  we agreed via unanimous consent to delay the vote on S  295 until the end of July 2005  provided that we receive two hours of debate and an up or down vote with no amendments   We also agreed not to offer our bill as an amendment to any other legislative vehicle        Since then  to show our willingness to be flexible and patient  we agreed to delay our vote on three separate occasions   Most recently  in March we agreed to delay a vote for six additional months to give the Chinese additional time to revalue their currency   In short  while we have been determined  we have also been reasonable        Now  the date in the agreement is approaching  and we are sorely disappointed with China  s pace of currency reform   In remarks preceding his trip to China  Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson stated that    with  China  s  leadership comes responsibility      China has clearly failed to live up to its international obligations        Since July 2005  when China allowed the yuan to appreciate by 2 1 percent and promised to allow market forces to work  the currency has only appreciated by an additional two percent   In this period  the trade deficit with China continued to accelerate   In August alone  our deficit with China reached  18 8 billion  33 percent greater than at the same time last year   Despite China  s rhetoric that revaluing their currency will destabilize their economy  we have seen quite the opposite   China  s economy is currently growing at an 11 percent annual rate  and its inflation rate has only been 1 3 percent over the last year        Therefore  we respectfully request that you schedule floor time for debate and a vote on S  295  as early during the week of September 25 as possible   In addition  given the importance and visibility of the issue  we also ask that you abide by your earlier assurance that the vote on S  295 not be one of the last orders of business before Congress adjourns for the 2006 elections   Thank you for your consideration        Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer
