                                                   WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today made the following statement on a deal reached between the Bush Administration and U S  Senators         The deal allows the terrorism trials of suspected terrorists to go forward at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba   It protects President Bush  s CIA program for High Value Targets  HVT   addresses the use of classified information in the trials of terrorists  and upholds our nation  s long standing commitment to the Geneva Conventions   It also prohibits terror suspects from filing lawsuits in federal court against American troops and protects CIA agents from frivolous lawsuits         Graham said         From the beginning we all shared the same goal   Now  we agree on the path to get there           I  m very pleased with the productive negotiations we had with the White House   We fine tuned the President  s proposal and have a much stronger work product than we did when we started   I appreciate the good faith negotiating done by Steve Hadley and Steve Bradbury   They are excellent advocates for President Bush and I appreciate their willingness to listen  understand  and work with us to address our concerns           President Bush and I want to put terrorists on trial for their actions before  on  and after 9 11   We also want to protect our nation from future attacks   However we must do so in a manner consistent with our laws  values  and traditions   The legislation we put together accomplishes these objectives        Major Points of the Agreement      The Supreme Court  in a decision I found troubling  decided to apply Geneva Convention protections to the War on Terror  Their decision is binding  but they gave Congress and the Administration wide latitude on its implementation          It was a false choice to think we had to choose between protecting the CIA program and abandoning our Geneva Convention obligations   It was also a false choice to think that we could not protect national security if we allowed a tribunal defendant to confront classified evidence against them   I think our legislation shows we are able to accomplish both objectives           We allow an effective and aggressive CIA program designed to gather good information to protect us from the terrorists to continue   The program will operate in a manner that will not put our troops in jeopardy today or in future wars by redefining or weakening our Geneva Convention protections           We also allow a terror suspect to confront the evidence against them while protecting national security by using rules and procedures already in place in our military justice system   The trials of terror suspects will be conducted in a manner unprecedented in American history   They will provide the strongest protections for classified information  but do so in a manner that will not convict someone without them ever knowing the evidence        The Supreme Court      Our efforts to put terror suspects on trial  gain convictions  and carry out a sentence are now two thirds complete   The last hurdle    the Supreme Court    will eventually judge whether our work product is constitutional   I think the fine tuning done during negotiations give us a much better chance of passing constitutional muster        Conclusion      Finally  I would not have been doing my job as Senator if I saw a problem with the President  s proposal    which I did    and didn  t work to address it in a constructive manner   I said it from the start  a conviction against a terror suspect in a military tribunal is no good if it is later overturned by the Supreme Court           As a nation  we will be better served by taking a few extra days and doing the best job we can to ensure the work product will withstand constitutional scrutiny   If the Supreme Court again strikes the tribunal process down  it will send us back to the drawing board   More importantly  justice will once again be delayed against those who have committed terrible acts against our nation                                                                      September 2006 Press Releases
