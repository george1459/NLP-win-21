                 Date  09 13 2005  Lindsey Graham Questioning of Supreme Court Nominee John Roberts Senate Committee on the Judiciary                                                                                                                                                                       SEN  ARLEN SPECTER    Thank you  Senator Feingold   Senator Graham       SEN  LINDSEY GRAHAM    Thank you  Mr  Chairman       I imagine the reason that you argued different positions is because people paid you  Is that correct       JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS    That s how I made my living  Senator       GRAHAM    OK  I can relate to that       I imagine it must be very hard to figure out what Congress intends  Do you agree with that       ROBERTS    Sometimes it s easier than others and sometimes it s hard to read the tea leaves       GRAHAM    I can relate to that also       I want to read an excerpt from the National Association of Women Lawyers and their evaluation of you    8 30 05    As a lawyer and judge  based on interviews the committee conducted  Judge Roberts has treated individual women lawyers fairly and with respect  has fostered careers of women lawyers  has been helpful in enabling women to address work life balance issues while advancing professionally  and has been consistently described as respectful to female colleagues  female lawyers appearing before him and female employees       You ve been asked about every case  I think  ever written by anyone  I would like to talk to you a little about life       The idea of judging you based on this section of the commerce clause and that section of the commerce clause is important  but I think most Americans want to know a little bit about you       And from what I can tell  the people who ve worked with you and against you generally like you  and that you ve been described as brilliant  one of the best legal minds of your time  well qualified       The adjectives go on and on  And I want the record to reflect  That comes from people who know you the best  The best indication of a good lawyer is how people on the other side think of you  And we ll get some excerpts from the record to put that into the record       Apparently  from what I can tell  you ve conducted your life in a noble  honorable manner  that you ve been a good litigant  and that you have fought for your causes and you have done so to earn respect of those on both sides of the aisle       But there s a greater issue here about who you are       Justice Rehnquist was your mentor  is that correct       ROBERTS    He s certainly someone from whom I learned a great deal  yes       GRAHAM    OK       So if I was trying to figure out who John Roberts is and a little bit about him  I will ask this question  Write the legacy of Justice Rehnquist for a minute or two  What would you say if given that task       ROBERTS    Well  you know  I think if you were able to ask him  he would talk about being a grandfather  being a father         GRAHAM    I m asking you       ROBERTS        being a husband       GRAHAM    I m asking you       ROBERTS    But the important point is that those were important things in his life and he appreciated the need to recognize that those are the most important things  With respect to the law to which he devoted his professional life  I think a big part of the legacy that he leaves is a Supreme Court in which all of the members respected and admired him because of his fairness in administering the court and conducting the important responsibilities like managing the conference and assigning opinions       GRAHAM    You can go back in history and look at what other chief justices did       Some were    in terms of that administrative responsibility    some were disasters       You look at Harlan Stone  his idea of running the conference  he said what he thought  then the next senior justice said what he thought  Then Justice Stone critiqued that  Then the next justice  and then Justice Stone critiqued that       And the result was the conferences went on for days and everybody ended up hating each other   So he ran a good ship  I think we all agree with that  And his colleagues respected him whether they disagreed with him or not       But the basic question is  when you write about the legacy of a Supreme Court justice  you write more than about being a grandfather    more about running a tight ship  especially chief justice  Would you agree with the idea that  from a conservative point of view  he was the gold standard       ROBERTS    I think he was a very effective advocate on the bench for a view of the Constitution that is one of limited and separated powers       GRAHAM    Do you share that view       ROBERTS    I do  I think that the    now  I have to tell you that whether as a judge on the court of appeals or if I am confirmed on the Supreme Court  I will certainly be my own man and there are         GRAHAM    No one is doubting that  No one is doubting that you will not try to be fair  But the big thing  30 000 foot view of you  is that when you look at Judge Roberts  you re looking at someone in the mold of a Rehnquist  Is that a fair assessment       ROBERTS    Well  you know  I admire the late chief justice very much  But I will have to insist that I will be my own man and I hesitate to be put in anybody s mold  And I would certainly approach the cases according to the judicial philosophy that I have developed over the years       In many respects  it s similar to his  in its recognition  I think  of the limited role that judges should have  an appropriate modesty and humility  a recognition that         GRAHAM    The idea of a dramatic departure under your watch from the Rehnquist era is probably not going to happen  is that true       ROBERTS    Given my view of the role of a judge which focuses on appropriate modesty and humility  the notion of dramatic departures is not one that I would hold out much hope for       GRAHAM    I know people don t like being labeled  Put me in that category  But I m in a business where people label me all the time  But I ask for it  I run for office       But we do tend in our business of politics to try to label people  particularly when we re talking about judges       When the president introduced you to the United States  to the people of the United States  he said you were a strict constructionist  Do you know what he meant by that and why he chose to use those words       ROBERTS    Well  I hope what he meant by that is somebody who is going to be faithful to the text of the Constitution  to the intent of those who drafted it  while appreciating that sometimes the phrases they used  they were drafting a Constitution for the ages  to secure the blessings of liberty for their posterity  They were looking ahead  And so they often used phrases that they intended to have          CROSSTALK       GRAHAM    Does that term make you feel uncomfortable       ROBERTS    No       GRAHAM    Now  from a 30 000 foot view of things  it seems to be that we re going to have a referendum on the Reagan era here  which I welcome  I sort of enjoyed it  he won 49 states  He did pretty good       You were part of the Reagan era as a young lawyer  When I use the word    term    Reagan revolution  what does it mean to you       ROBERTS    Well  it means to me generally a change in attitude  President Reagan always presented an optimistic view  He always told us that the best days of our country were ahead of us  And he reasserted basic fundamental truths in areas like foreign relations  We are going to stand up to the Soviet Union  We re proud of our system of government  That s the right approach  not the Soviet approach  And people who have come of age after the Berlin Wall has fallen sometimes don t understand what it meant at that time       GRAHAM    When it comes to the law  what does the term Reagan revolution mean to you       ROBERTS    I think it means a belief that we should interpret the Constitution according to its terms  that judges don t shape policy  that judges interpret the law and that legislators shape policy  that the executive branch executes the law       GRAHAM    Does it also mean that when you talk about affirmative action and you set up a quota system  that s not right       ROBERTS    President Reagan s policy was opposed to quotas  which were much more rigid at the time       People need to appreciate 24 years ago the idea of a quota was a rigid set aside  We now have the recent Supreme Court decisions talking about consideration of particular factors as one factor in an affirmative action program       President Reagan was in favor of affirmative action and he was opposed to quotas       GRAHAM    When it comes to voting rights  as I understand    and we talked a lot about it  and we probably know more than all of us ever dreamed we would know about the Voting Rights Act    that you were implementing a policy of President Reagan that wanted to pass the Voting Rights Act in its form that you received it  Is that correct       ROBERTS    The proposal was to extend it for the longest period in history without change       GRAHAM    And we ve been through a long discourse about the effect and intent test  I think you ve explained yourself very well that the Supreme Court in the Mobile case said the intent test applies to Section 2  Is that right       ROBERTS    Section 2       GRAHAM    But politics took over after that  didn t it  Because the effect test no longer    that s not the test  Isn t it some compromise between Senator Kennedy and Senator Dole       ROBERTS    There was a compromise in the test under Section 2  which is articulated in a paragraph describing what the criteria are  including a caution that this should not be read to promote proportional representation  which was some of the concern that the attorney general and President Reagan had       GRAHAM    So between Dole  Senator Kennedy and President Reagan  a new test was called the totality of the circumstances       ROBERTS    Yes       GRAHAM    Now  when you said that you    Senator Kennedy said something I thought was very important  that courts should not stand in the way of elected officials who are trying to right wrongs       And the point I m trying to make here is that you were picked by a conservative president because you have associated yourself with the conservative administrations in the past  advising conservative presidents about conservative policies       And there s another selection to be made  and you re going to get the same type person       And you can    I m not even talking to you now        LAUGHTER       To expect anything else is just not fair  I don t expect    I didn t expect    President Clinton to pick you  It s not because you re not well qualified  not because you re a good person  just a different political  legal philosophy       Now  that s what we re going to have to come to grips with here       Justice Scalia  Do you consider him conservative       ROBERTS    Yes       GRAHAM    Do you think you re more conservative than he is       ROBERTS    Oh  I don t know  I mean  I wouldn t         GRAHAM    Well  he got 98 votes  And I think you re a conservative  but I think you re one of the great minds of our generation  of our time  And I m dying to find out if you get any votes on the other side       Time will tell       Let s talk about righting wrongs here  I think it stinks that somebody can burn the flag and that s called speech       What do you think about that       ROBERTS    Well          LAUGHTER       We had the Flag Protection Act after the Supreme Court concluded that it was protected speech       GRAHAM    Show me where the term symbolic speech is in the Constitution       ROBERTS    Well  it s not       GRAHAM    It s not  They just made it up  didn t they  And I think it stinks that a kid that can t go to school and say a prayer if he wants to voluntarily       What do you think about that       ROBERTS    That s something that s probably inappropriate for me to comment on       GRAHAM    What do you think Ronald Reagan thought about that       ROBERTS    His view was that voluntary school prayer was appropriate       GRAHAM    I think it s not right for elected officials to be unable to talk about or protect the unborn       What do you think about that       ROBERTS    Well  again  Senator  these are issues that are likely to come before the court  and I can t comment on those particulars because         GRAHAM    Why are judges more capable of protecting or talking about the unborn than elected officials       ROBERTS    Well  again  those are issues that come before the court on a regular basis in particular cases  And on my current court or the future court  I need to be able to approach those cases with an open mind and not on the basis of statements I make during a confirmation hearing       GRAHAM    The point is that righting wrongs is a very subjective thing  And you will be asked to decide the fate of people with individual needs and individual desires  based on particular fact patterns and legal briefs       I m confident you can do that and that you will do that  And I don t think you need to make a bargain with me to right all the wrongs that I see in life to sit on the Supreme Court       What s it like to go through the nominating process in 2005 from a personal point of view  I ve been watching television  channel flipping  and I see some awful things said about you  Have you seen those things       ROBERTS    I ve seen some things  yes       GRAHAM    How does that make you feel       ROBERTS    Well  some of the mischaracterizations  you know  you get annoyed at them  I don t like them  Some of the things you see you get pretty upset about       GRAHAM    How s it make your family feel       ROBERTS    I would say they get upset about some of the things  as well       GRAHAM    But  you know  it s a free country and that s just the way it is  Right       ROBERTS    It is  and it s an expression I ve been using a lot lately  It is a free country  and it s a good thing that it is       GRAHAM    Let s not talk about you now  but I would like you to comment  give us some advice here  We re always trying to advise the president through you       What s the long term effect on the quality of candidates that we ll be able to recruit for jobs like the Supreme Court if the current process continues and grows over time       ROBERTS    I think it is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them  I think that is not a good development  to regard the courts as simply an extension of the political process  That s not what they are       I have been fortunate for the past two years to serve on a court in which all of the judges    and they come  the D C  Circuit  they come from very active careers in public life and sometimes very identified politically    but it s a court where those judges put aside those ties and those views and become judges all focused on the same mission of vindicating the rule of law       And if you look at the decisions on the D C  Circuit  you ll see that we are almost always unanimous  we almost always come out the same way  And to the extent there are disagreements  they don t shape up along political lines       That is an ideal  But the more and more that the process becomes politicized  the less likely that that s going to happen       GRAHAM    Another line of inquiry that s been disturbing to me is that we talk about the clients you represent  whether it be the Ronald Reagan administration or some private sector client  and we tend to hold that maybe unpopular position against the lawyer  There s more and more of that happening       We ve had court of appeal nominees that were accused of being insensitive to the disabled population when they won their case 9 0 in the Supreme Court defending a university from the idea that they were not covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act       I really do worry that in the future that if we up here start holding who you represent against you  that young lawyers in the future will pass on the hard cases       What s your thoughts about that       ROBERTS    You know  it s a tradition of the American bar that goes back before the founding of the country that lawyers are not identified with the positions of their clients       The most famous example probably was John Adams  who represented the British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre  And he did that for a reason  because he wanted to show that the revolution in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule of law  it was about vindicating the rule of law       Our founders thought that they were not being given their rights  under the British system  to which they were entitled  And  by representing the British soldiers  he helped show that what they were about was defending the rule of law  not undermining it    And that principle  that you don t identify the lawyer with the particular views of the client  or the views that the lawyer advances on behalf of a client  is critical to the fair administration of justice       GRAHAM    Do you believe it s being eroded       ROBERTS    I do think there is an unfortunate tendency to attack lawyers because of the positions they press on behalf of clients  And I think that s unfortunate       GRAHAM    I m going to give you some examples of a sitting Supreme Court justice and her positions and basically take us back to the good old days where you could have what I think are extreme positions and still make it       Are you familiar with the ACLU       ROBERTS    Certainly       GRAHAM    In the conservative world  how does that rank on the food chain       ROBERTS    I don t know that I could comment on that  but they have a consistent position of promoting civil liberties and a particular view on that       GRAHAM    If you came to the Reagan administration and the top thing on their resume was the general counsel for the ACLU  do you think they would hire you       ROBERTS    Might make it a little harder        LAUGHTER       GRAHAM    Yes        LAUGHTER       I think that s a good observation  Well  we have  on the sitting Supreme Court now  the former general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union  who is a very nice lady  extremely qualified    I don t agree with her hardly at all    but a great lawyer       She has written that the age of consent for women should be 12  that all prisons to have gender equality  men and women should be in the same prison because  when you separate them  women prisoners somehow are discriminated against       She wanted to do away or argued the idea that Mother s and Father s Day should be done away with because it stereotypes men and women    that there s a constitutional right to prostitution       I can give you    and I ll introduce into the record    writings from her point of view that most conservatives would find totally unacceptable  But this person  this lady  the former ACLU executive counsel  is sitting on the Supreme Court  and she got 96 votes       She said that there should be federal funding for abortion  90 percent of our caucus is pro life    is that about right  Pretty close  I could assure you that  if a Republican was going to make their vote based on abortion thinking  she would have gotten no votes  Most Americans don t want federal funding of abortion  even though they re divided on the issue of a woman s right to choose       GRAHAM    She has argued that the equal protection clause guarantees a right to abortion       Now  I completely differ with that  and I m sure the conservatives in the Senate at the time of her confirmation completely differed with that  the idea the age of consent should be 12  that bigamy statutes are discriminatory to women       I can go on and on and on       And the point I m trying to make is that all of that was put aside  who she represented and what she believed and the position she took  and somehow back then they re able to see in Justice Ginsburg a well qualified  brilliant legal mind and they deferred to President Clinton because he won the election       Whether that happens to you  I don t know       But for the sake of the country and the rule of law  I hope you can be in the ballpark of where she wound up       Last two questions       In your opening statement  you articulated the rule of law in a way that I thought was just outstanding  It was emotional  it made sense  average people could understand it  that the courtroom is a quiet place  Judge Roberts  where you park your political ideology and you call the balls and you call the strikes  and you try to give every American a fair shake and you put politics in its perspective       What is your biggest concern  if any  about the rule of law as it exists in America  And what are the biggest threats to the rule of law as we know it today       ROBERTS    Well  you know  the rule of law is always vulnerable because the Supreme Court  as has been pointed out often in history  has only the persuasive power of its opinions to command respect       There have been famous episodes in the past  you know    President Jackson  Chief Justice Marshall has given his opinion  let s see him enforce it    other episodes of that sort       But over time  the legitimacy of the Supreme Court has been established and it s generally recognized across the political spectrum that it is the obligation of the court to say what the law is and that the other branches have the obligation to obey what the Supreme Court says the law is       The one threat I think to the rule of law is a tendency on behalf of some judges to take that legitimacy and that authority and extend it into areas where they re going beyond the interpretation of the Constitution  where they re making the law       And because it s the Supreme Court  people are going to follow it even though they re making the law       The judges have to recognize that their role is a limited one  That is the basis of their legitimacy  I ve said it before  and I ll just repeat myself  The framers were not the sort of people  having fought a revolution to get the right of self government  to sit down and say  Let s take all the difficult issues before us and let s have the judges decide them  That would have been the farthest thing from their mind       The judges had the obligation to decide cases and the authority to interpret the Constitution because they had to decide cases  And they were going to decide those cases according to the law  not according to their personal preferences       Judges have to have the courage to make the unpopular decisions when they have to  That sometimes involves striking down acts of Congress  That sometimes involves ruling that acts of that executive are unconstitutional  That is a requirement of the judicial oath  You have to have that courage  but you also have to have the self  restraint to recognize that your role is limited to interpreting the law and does not include making the law       GRAHAM    What would you like history to say about you when it s all said and done       ROBERTS    I d like them to start by saying  He was confirmed        LAUGHTER       Whether they say that or not  I would like    the answer is the same  I would like them to say I was a good judge       GRAHAM    Thank you very much  I have no further questions
