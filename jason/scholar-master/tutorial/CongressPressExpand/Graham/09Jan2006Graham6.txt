    Date  01 09 2006  Opening Statement at the Judiciary Committee Hearing on Judge Samuel Alito                                                                                                                                                                                               Thank you  Mr  Chairman   And welcome back  Judge  I d hate for you to miss my opening statement    LAUGHTER   It would be a loss for the ages        Welcome to the committee  Welcome to one of the most important events in your life        You ve got the people that mean the most here with you today  your family  I know they re proud of you  I m certainly proud of what you have been able to accomplish   And to say the least  you come to the Senate in interesting political times        There is going to be a lot of talk by the senators of this committee about concepts that are important to Americans  But what I worry the most about    your time  believe it or not  will come and go  You will not be here forever  it may just seem that way  But I think you re going to be just fine  I don t know what kind of vote you re going to get  but you ll make it through        It s possible you could talk me out of voting for you  but I doubt it   So I won t even try to challenge you along those lines  I feel very comfortable with you being on the Supreme Court based on what I know   And the hearings will be helpful to all of us to find out some issues that are important to us        We had a talk recently about executive power  That s very important to me  In a time of war  I want the executive branch to have the tools to protect me  my family and my country   But also I believe even during a time of war  the rule of law applies  And I ve got some problems with using a force resolution to the point that future presidents may not be able to get a force resolution from Congress if you interpret it too broadly        We ve talked about those things and we ll talk more about it   But I m going to talk a little bit about some of the points my colleagues have been making        Everybody knows you re a conservative   The question is  Are you a mainstream conservative        Well  the question I have for my colleagues is  Who would you ask to find out  Would you ask Senator Kennedy   Probably not   If you asked me who a mainstream liberal is  I would be the worst person to pick  because I do not hang out over there    LAUGHTER          I expect that most all of us  if not all of us  will vote for you   I would argue that we represent from the center line to the right ditch in our party and  if all of us vote for you  you ve got to be pretty mainstream   So the answer to the question  Are you a mainstream conservative  We  ll soon know  If every Republican member of the Judiciary Committee votes for you  and you re not mainstream  that means we are not mainstream  It is a word that means what you want it to mean        Advise and consent means what  Whatever you want it to be  Advise and consent means the process has got to work to the advantage of people I like and with people I don t want on the court  it is a different process  That is politics        Every senator will have to live within themselves as to what they would like to see happen for the judiciary   My main concern here is not about you  it s about us  What are we going to be doing as a body to the judiciary when it is all said and done        Roe v  Wade and abortion   If I wanted to work for Ronald Reagan  one of the things I would tell the Reagan Administration is I think Roe v  Wade was wrongly decided  They are likely to hire me because they were trying to prove to the court that the court took away from elected officials a very important right  protecting the unborn        I was on the news program with Senator Feinstein this weekend  who is a terrific person  She made a very emotional  compelling argument that she can remember back alley abortions and women committing suicide when abortion was illegal        I understand that is seared in her memory banks and that is important to her  Let me tell you  there s another side to that story  There are millions of Americans    a bunch of them in South Carolina    who are heartsick that millions of unborn children have been sent to a certain death because of what judges have done   It s a two sided argument and an emotional event in our society        They re talking about maybe filibustering if you don t give the right answer  Well  what could possibly be the right answer about Roe v  Wade  If you acknowledge it s a precedent of the court  well  then you would be right  If you refused to listen to someone who s trying to change the way it s applied or to overturn it and you will say  Here  I will never listen to them  you might talk me out of voting for you        I don t think any American should lose the right to challenge any precedent the Supreme Court has issued because the judge wanted to get on the court   You may be a great fan of Roe v  Wade and you think it should be there forever  There may be a case where someone disagrees with that line of reasoning        What I want from the judge is an understanding that precedent matters but the facts  the brief and the law is what you re going to base your decision on as to whether or not that precedent stands   Not some bargain to get on the court        Because I can tell you  if that ever becomes a reason to filibuster  there are plenty of people that I personally know  if it became fashionable to stand on the floor of the Senate to stop a nominee on the issue of abortion  feel so deeply  so honestly held belief that an abortion is certain death for an unborn child that they would stand on their feet forever        Is that what we want  Is that where we re going as a nation  Are we going to take one case and one issue  and if we don t get the answer we like that represents our political view on that issue  are we going to bring the judiciary to their knees        Are we going to say as a body  It doesn t matter how smart you are  how many cases you decided  how many things you ve done in your life as a lawyer  forget about it  it all comes down to this one issue         If we do  if we go down that road  there will be no going back  Good men and women will be deterred from coming before this body to serve their nation as a judge at the highest levels        What we re saying and what we re doing here is far more important than just whether or not Judge Alito gets through the process        What is the proper role of a senator when it come to advise and consent        I would argue that  if we start taking the one or two cases we cherish the most and make that a litmus test  we ve let our country down and we ve changed a historical standard        Elections matter  Values debates occur all over this country  They occur in presidential elections  It is no mystery as to what President Bush would do if he won  He would pick people like John Roberts and Sam Alito   That s what he said he would do  That s exactly what he s done  He s picked solid  strict constructionist conservatives who have long  distinguished legal careers        What did President Clinton do  He picked people left of the center who worked for Democrats  It cannot surprise anybody on the other side that two people we picked worked for Ronald Reagan  We like Ronald Reagan        President Clinton picked Ginsburg and Breyer  Justice Ginsburg was the general counsel for the ACLU  If I m going to base my decision based on who you represented as a lawyer  how in the world could I ever vote for somebody that represented the ACLU        If I m going to make my decision based on whether or not I agree with the Princeton faculty and administration policies on ROTC students and quotas and I am bound by that  I ll get killed at home        What the president does with their admission policies and whether or not an ROTC unit should be on a campus is an OK thing to debate  At least I hope it is OK   I think most American are going to be with the group that you re associated with  not the policies of Princeton        The bottom line is you come here as an individual with a life well lived  Everybody who seems to work with you as a private lawyer  public lawyer  as a judge  admires you  even though they may disagree with you   My biggest concern  members of this committee  is if we don t watch the way we treat people like Judge Alito  we re going to drive good men and women away from wanting to serve        There ll be a Democratic president one day  I do not know when  but that s likely to happen  There ll be another Justice Ginsburg come over  If she came over in this atmosphere  she wouldn t get 96 votes  Justice Scalia wouldn t get 98 votes  And that s sad to me        I hope we ll use this opportunity to not only treat you fairly but not use a double standard  I hope we ll understand this is bigger than you  this is bigger than us  The way we conduct ourselves and what we expect of you  we better be expecting when we re not in power        Thank you
