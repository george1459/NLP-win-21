10 2006  Graham Questioning of Judge Samuel Alito in the Senate Judiciary Committee                                                                                                                                                                                               HATCH    Mr  Chairman        SPECTER    Senator Hatch       HATCH    On this particular issue  could I just take two minutes out of my next round       SPECTER    If you want to comment  you may  And Senator Feingold should have an opportunity to respond       HATCH    Sure   On the form that you filled out  the question was  Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest  including the procedure you will follow in determining these areas of concern  Identify the categories of litigation and financial arrangements that are likely to present potential conflicts of interest during your initial service in the position to which you have been nominated       HATCH    Now  this case arose 12 years later  didn t it       ALITO    Yes  it did  Senator       HATCH    That s hardly your initial service  To be held to that type of a standard  especially in a case that every ethics professor I know of says you didn t do anything wrong in  seems to me is going a little bit beyond the pale here  And it is overblown  And  frankly  I think you got to read the whole thing  You re a good lawyer and you agreed to do it  but it was during your initial service       Now  I guess you could interpret initial service to be a year or two or three years  But 12 years  I don t think so       SPECTER    Senator Feingold    CROSSTALK       FEINGOLD    Yes  I mean  the fact is the nominee continues to have the holdings in Vanguard  They ve appreciated in value  Time hasn t changed that  I think the judge here was at least trying to suggest there might have been some mistake made here  and instead we re getting sort of after the fact justifications that put some kind of a time limit on the promise he made to this committee  And there was no time limit on the promise that was made to the committee       HATCH    I still have 30 seconds left       Judge  number one  you ve researched it and you didn t have to recuse yourself  You concluded that       ALITO    Yes  I did       HATCH    Number two  these ethics professors have concluded that  right       ALITO    That s right       HATCH    Number three  you have tried to comport with the highest standards of ethics during your whole 15 years on the bench  Right       ALITO    I have tried to do that         HATCH    Number four  I believe we ll have judges from that court who will say that you have       SPECTER    Senator Feingold       FEINGOLD    Mr  Chairman  I m curious if this isn t a situation where he felt the need to recuse himself  why he would have put Vanguard on the list as something he should recuse himself from after the fact       HATCH    Because he was mistaken  That s why       SPECTER    All right  we re going move on now  I think that this slight exchange is permissible as an exception to our general rules  It livens up the afternoon  LAUGHTER       HATCH    I want my two minutes back       SPECTER    Anything at about 5 30 in the afternoon is welcome       LEAHY    The chairman was disturbed by my snoring over here   LAUGHTER       SPECTER    Senator Graham       GRAHAM    Hello        LAUGHTER       ALITO    Hello  Senator       GRAHAM    That was an interesting exchange   I guess there s no rule against beating a dead horse  or we d all have quit a long time ago   LAUGHTER   So in the next 30 minutes  I m going to ask you the same questions you ve been asked for a whole day   LAUGHTER   And I hope you ll understand if any us come before a court and we can t remember Abramoff  you will tend to believe us   LAUGHTER        CROSSTALK       GRAHAM    Now I know why they give you a lifetime appointment for doing this  I was skeptical before  but I think once is enough in a lifetime       For what it s worth  I think you ve done a great job  You ve been very forthcoming  You ve seldom used  I may have to decide that  You ve answered a lot of questions       And I particularly enjoyed Senator Feingold s questions about the executive power  And I will pick up on that       Number one  from a personal point of view  do you believe the attacks on 9 11 against our nation were a crime or an act of war       ALITO    That s a hard question to answer       GRAHAM    Good       ALITO    That s a way of buying 30 seconds while I think about the answer       Senator  I think that what I think personally about this is really not    it s not something that would be    that would inform anything that I would have to do as a judge       GRAHAM    Well  Judge  I guess I disagree  Because I think we re at war  And the law of armed conflict in a war time environment is different than dealing with domestic criminal enterprises  Do you agree with that        ALITO    It certainly is       GRAHAM    We have laws on the book that protects us  the Fourth Amendment included  from our own law enforcement agencies coming against our own citizens  But we also have laws on the books during a time of war to protect our country from being infiltrated by foreign powers and bodies who wish to do harm to us  That s a totally different legal concept  Is that correct       ALITO    I m reluctant to get into this because I think things like act of war can well have particular legal meanings in particular context  under the Constitution         GRAHAM    Do you doubt that our nation has been in an armed conflict with terrorist organizations since 9 11  that we ve been in an undeclared state of war       ALITO    In a lay sense  certainly  we ve been in a conflict with terrorist organizations  I m just concerned that  in the law  all of these phrases can have particular meanings that are defined by the cases and are         GRAHAM    That s very important  And let s have a continuing legal education seminar here about the law of armed conflict in the Hamdi case       The Hamdi case is precedent  is that correct       ALITO    It certainly is       GRAHAM    It s a decision of the Supreme Court  And it tells us at least two to three things  Number one  it tells us something that I find reassuring  that the Bill of Rights  the Constitution  survive even in a time of war       ALITO    That is certainly true       GRAHAM    So  there s a holding in that case that I want to associate myself with  and I think Senator Feingold does  that  even during a time of war when your values are threatened by an enemy who does not adhere to those values  they will not be threatened by your government unless there s a good reason  Do you agree with that  sir       ALITO    Senator  I agree that the constitution was meant to deal with all of the contingencies that our country was going to face       I think the framers hoped that we would not get involved in many wars but they were students of history and I m sure they realized that there would be wars  They provided for war powers for the president and for Congress  And the structure is meant to apply both in peace and in war       GRAHAM    And you said in your previous testimony that no political figure in this country is above the law  even in a time of war       ALITO    That is correct       GRAHAM    OK  There s another aspect of the Hamdi case that no one s picked up on  but I will read to you  In light of these principles  it is of no moment that the authorization to use military force does not use specific language of detention because detention to prevent a combatant s return to the battlefield is a fundamental instant of waging war       In permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force  Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here       And those circumstances were a person alleged by the executive branch to be an enemy combatant  And one of the principles we found from the Hamdi case that because we are  in my opinion  at war and Congress has authorized the president to use force against our enemies  the executive branch  according to the Hamdi case  inherent to his power of being commander in chief  can detain people who have been caught on the battlefield       Does that make sense to you  Do you agree that s a principle of the Hamdi case       ALITO    That is a principle of the Hamdi case       GRAHAM    And it makes perfect sense  Because if we catch someone in Afghanistan or Iraq or any other place in the world who is committing acts of violence against our troops or our forces  or we catch people here in the United States who have infiltrated our country for the purpose of sabotaging our nation  there is no requirement in the law to catch and release these people  Is there       ALITO    Well  Hamdi speaks to the situation of an individual who was caught on the battlefield         GRAHAM    In the history of our nation  when we captured German and Japanese prisoners  was there ever a legal requirement anybody advanced that after a specific period of time you have to let them go       ALITO    It s my understanding that the prisoners of war who were taken in World War II were held until the conflict was over       GRAHAM    It would be an absurd conclusion for a court or anyone else to tell the executive branch that if you caught somebody legitimately engaged in hostile activities against the United States that you have to let them go and go back and fight us again  That makes no sense  does it       ALITO    Well  I explained what my understanding is about how this matter of holding prisoners was handled in prior wars  This issue was addressed in Hamdi  or it was discussed in Hamdi in the context         GRAHAM    In the Padilla case they held an American citizen who was engaged in hostile activities against the United States  allegedly  as an enemy combatant   And the 4th Circuit said the president  during a time of hostility  has the ability to do that       Do you agree that that s a part of our jurisprudence       ALITO    That was    the holding in Padilla       GRAHAM    Yes       ALITO    Yes  That was the holding of the lower court    of Padilla  yes       GRAHAM    The point I m trying to make is that when you re engaged in hostilities there are some things that we assume the president will do       If we don t kill the enemy  we capture the enemy  The president as the commander in chief will make sure they don t go back to the battle  Number two  that if we catch someone and there s a question to their status whether or not you re a prisoner of war in the Geneva Convention  are you an enemy combatant  who traditionally in our constitutional democracy determines whether or not the status of a person engaged in hostilities       ALITO    Well  Padilla    I m sorry  Hamdi said that a person who was being detained  an unlawful person who s asserted to be an unlawful combatant and who is being detained has due process rights  And the issue of the type of tribunal    and they explained to some degree how that would be handled       But the identity of the particular tribunal that would be required to adjudicate that was not an issue that was decided in Hamdi or any of the other cases       GRAHAM    Can you show me an example in American jurisprudence where the question of status  whether a person was a lawful combatant or an unlawful combatant  was decided by a court and not the military       ALITO    I can t think of an example  I can t say that I am able to survey the whole history of this issue  but I          CROSSTALK       GRAHAM    Can you show me in a case in American jurisprudence where an enemy prisoner held by our military was allowed to bring a lawsuit against our own military regarding their detention        ALITO    I am not aware of such a case       GRAHAM    Is there a constitutional right for a foreign  noncitizen enemy prisoner to have access to our courts to sue regarding their condition of the confinement under our Constitution       ALITO    Well  I m not aware of a precedent that addresses the issue       GRAHAM    Do you know of any case where an enemy prisoner of war brought a habeas petition in World War II objecting to be their confinement to our federal judiciary       ALITO    There may have been a lower court case  I m trying to remember the exact status of the individual       GRAHAM    Let me help you  There were two cases  One of them involved six saboteurs  the in re Quirin case  Would you agree with me that that case stood for the proposition that in a time of war or declared hostilities an illegal combatant  even though they may be an American citizen  the proper forum for them to be tried in is a military tribunal and they re not entitled to a jury trial as an American citizen in a non wartime environment       ALITO    Well  those were a number of German saboteurs who landed by submarine in the United States  And they were taken into custody  And they were tried before a military tribunal       And the case went up to the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court sustained their being tried before a military tribunal  At least one of them claimed to be an American citizen  And most of them  I think all but one or two  actually were executed       GRAHAM    And our Supreme Court said that is the proper forum during a war time environment to try people who were engaged in a legal combat activities against our country  Is that correct       ALITO    They sustained what was done under the circumstances       GRAHAM    That would be a precedent then  wouldn t it       ALITO    It is a precedent  Yes       GRAHAM    OK       There was a case involving six Germans  soldiers  captured in Japan and transferred to Germany  and they brought a habeas petition to be released in the    I can t remember the          ALITO    Eisentrager       GRAHAM    You know it  Tell me what the court decided there        ALITO  They were  as I recall  they were Germans who were found in China         GRAHAM    China  You re right      ALITO        assisting the Japanese after termination of the war with Germany  And they were unsuccessful in their habeas petition  That was interpreted  prior to the Supreme Court s decision a couple of years ago  to mean that there was a lack of habeas jurisdiction over them because they were being held in territory that was not U S  territory       GRAHAM    For those who are watching who are not lawyers  generally speaking  in all of the wars that we ve been involved in we don t let the people trying to kill us sue us  Right  And we re not going to let them go at an arbitrary time period if we think they re still dangerous because we don t want to go have to shoot at them again or let them shoot at us again       Is that a good summary of the law of armed conflict       ALITO    I don t know whether I d put it quite that broadly  Senator        LAUGHTER       The precedent that you    the Johnson v  Eisentrager  of course  has been substantially modified  if not overruled  Ex Parte Quirin  of course  is still a precedent       There was a lower precedent involving someone who fought with the Italian army  And I can t remember the exact name of it  And that was the case that I thought you were referring to when you first framed the question       But those are the precedents in the area  Then  if you go back to the Civil War  there s Ex Parte Milligan and a few others       GRAHAM    We don t have to go back that far        LAUGHTER       ALITO    Well  in this area         GRAHAM    Well         ALITO        it s actually instructive to do it       But in Hamdi the court addressed this question of how long the detention should take place  And they said    because they were responding to the argument that this situation is not like the wars of the past which had a more or less fixed    it was not anticipated that they would go on for a generation  And they said  We ll get to that if it develops that way       GRAHAM    Who is better able to determine if an enemy combatant properly held has ongoing intelligence value to our country  Is it the military or a judge        ALITO    On intelligence matters I would think that is an issue    that is an area where the judiciary doesn t have expertise  But we do get into this issue I was discussing with Senator Feingold about the degree to which the balance between the judiciary s performing its function in cases involving individual rights and its desire not to intrude into areas where it lacks expertise  particularly in times of war and national crisis       GRAHAM    So  having said that  if we have a decision to make as a country when to let someone go who s an enemy combatant  I guess we ve got two choices       We can have court cases or we can allow the military to make a determination if that person still presents a threat to the United States and whether or not that person has an intelligence value by further confinement       Do you feel the courts possess the capabilities and the confidence to make those two decisions better than the military       ALITO    The courts do not have expertise in foreign affairs or in military affairs  And they certainly should recognize that  And that is one powerful consideration in addressing legal issues that may come up in this context       But there is the other powerful consideration that it is the responsibility of the courts to protect individual rights in cases that are properly before the court  cases where they have jurisdiction in one way or another  cases that are fit for judicial resolution       GRAHAM    I totally understand that  But our courts have not  by tradition  gotten involved in running military jails during a time of war       I can t think of one time where a prisoner of war housed in the United States during World War II  a German Nazi or a Japanese prisoner  was able to go and sue our own troops about their confinement       I think there s a reason there s none of those cases  It would lead to chaos  Now  when it comes to treating detainees and how to treat them  I think the Congress has a big role to play  And I think that the courts have a big role to play  Are you familiar with the Geneva Convention       ALITO    I have some familiarity with it  I m         GRAHAM    Do you believe it s been good for our country to be a signatory to that convention       ALITO    I think it has  But that s not really my area of authority   That s Congress  area of authority       GRAHAM    Well  just as an American citizen  are you proud of the fact that your country has signed up the Geneva Convention and that we have laid out a system of how we treat people who fall into our hands and how we ll engage in war       ALITO    I think the Geneva Convention    and I m not an expert on the Geneva Conventions    but I think they express some very deep values of the American people  And we ve been a signatory of them for some time  And I think that         GRAHAM    Now  let s go back to the legal application of the Geneva Convention       If someone was captured by an American force and detained either at home or abroad  would the Geneva Convention give that detainee a private cause of action against the United States government       ALITO    Well  that s an issue I believe in the Hamdan case  which is an actual case that s before the Supreme Court  And it goes to the question of whether a treaty is self executing or not  Some treaties are self executing         GRAHAM    Has there ever been an occasion in all the wars we fought where the Geneva Convention was involved whether the courts treated the Geneva Convention as a private cause of action to bring a lawsuit against our own troops       ALITO    I m not familiar with such a case  But I can t say whether there might be some case or not       GRAHAM    Now  when it comes to what authority the executive has during a time of war  we know the Supreme Court has said it s implicit from the force resolution that you can detain people captured on the battlefield  Hamdi stands for that proposition  Is that correct       ALITO    That s what was involved in Hamdi       GRAHAM    OK  The problem that Senator Feingold has and I have and some of the rest of us have is does that force resolution  does it have the legal effect of creating an exception to the FISA Court       And I know that may come before you  but let s talk about generally how the law works  You say that the president has to follow every statute on the books unless the statute allows an exception for the president  Is that a fair statement  Just being president  you can t set aside the law       ALITO    The president has to follow the law  and that means the Constitution and the laws that are enacted consistent with the Constitution       GRAHAM    There s a statute that we have on the books against torture  Are you familiar with that statute       ALITO    Convention against torture  I am  Well  the statutes implementing the convention against torture       GRAHAM    And the statute provides the death penalty for somebody who violates the conventions as a possible punishment       ALITO    That s right       If death results  the death penalty is available       GRAHAM    So this idea that Senator McCain somehow banned torture is not quite right  The convention on torture and the statute that we have implementing that convention were on the books long before this year       GRAHAM    Is that correct       ALITO    Yes  they were       GRAHAM    Do you believe that any president  because we re at war  could say  the statute on torture gets in the way of my ability to defend the United States  therefore I don t have to comply with it       ALITO    The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws of the United States that are enacted consistent with the Constitution  That is the principle       The president is not above the Constitution and the laws  Now  there are issues about the interpretation of the laws and the interpretation of the Constitution       GRAHAM    Are you a strict constructionist       ALITO    I think it depends on what you mean by that phrase  And if you         GRAHAM    Well  let s forget that  We ll never get to the end of that    LAUGHTER    Have you heard the term used       ALITO    I have heard the term used       GRAHAM    Is it fair to say that  when it s used by politicians  people like me  that we re trying to tell the public we want a judge who looks at things very narrowly  that doesn t make a bunch of stuff up       Is that a fair understanding of what a strict constructionist may be in the political world       ALITO    Well  if a strict constructionist is a judge who doesn t make things up  than I m a strict constructionist   LAUGHTER       GRAHAM    There you go       ALITO    I agree with that  Senator   LAUGHTER       GRAHAM    Now  if there s a force resolution that Congress passes to allow any president to engage in military activity against someone trying to do us harm and the force resolution says  The president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations  organizations or persons he determines  planned  authorized  committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11  2001    or just make it generic    if someone argued that that declaration by Congress was a blanket exemption to the warrant requirement under FISA  would that be a product of strict constructionist legal reasoning       ALITO    I think that a strict constructionist as you understand it would engage in a certain process in evaluating that question  And a strict constructionist  a person who interprets the law    that s how I would put it    a person who interprets the law would look at the language of the authorization for the use of military force and legislative history that was informative  maybe past practices  Were there prior enactments that are analogous to that  What was the understanding of those  And a host of other considerations that might go into the interpretive process       GRAHAM    I guess what I m saying  Judge  is I can understand why the court ruled that the president has within his authority to detain people on the battlefield under this force resolution  That makes sense  I understand why the president believes he has the ability to surveil the enemy at a time of war       And the idea that our president or this administration took the law in their own hands and ignored precedent of other presidents or case law and just tried to make a power grab  I don t agree with       But this is really not about you  so you don t have to listen  I m talking to other people right now        LAUGHTER       The point I m trying to make    the point I m trying to make is what Justice Jackson made  is that  when it comes to issues like this  when we surveil our enemy and we ve cross the our own borders and we have information about our own people  we need  in my opinion  Judge  to have the president at the strongest  And that would be when Congress  through collaboration with the president  comes up with a method of dealing with that situation       And then it could be very dangerous in the long run if we over  interpret war resolutions  Because I ve got a problem with that  And I believe that if we don t watch it and we over interpret these resolutions  that we will have a chilling effect for the next president       The next president who wants to use force to protect us in a justifiable manner may be less likely to get that resolution approved if we go too far       And Judge  you re likely to rule on these issues       And my hope is  before you rule  that we all sit down between the executive and the legislative and we talk about this  because  as you said before  our nation  not only our legal system  is strongest when we work together       Executive power  The Constitution allows the president to nominate judges  If Congress tried to change that by statute and say that we would like to pick the judges  what would happen  hypothetically       ALITO    I have a certain amount of self interest in the answer to that question       GRAHAM    Yes  I thought you might  yes       Clearly  clearly  the statute would fall under the Constitution  A veto is not reviewable by courts because that s a basically political decision       Under the Constitution  what s the vote requirement to get confirmed to the Supreme Court       ALITO    It s a majority       GRAHAM    Hypothetically speaking  what if the Senate passed a statute or had a rule that said you can t get a vote to be on the Supreme Court unless you get 60 votes  How does that sit with you       ALITO    Speaking in my personal capacity or my judicial capacity       GRAHAM    Your judicial capacity       ALITO    Senator  I just don t think I should answer questions like    constitutional questions like that       GRAHAM    What if the Senate said during impeachment that we don t want a two thirds vote of the Senate  we want a majority vote  Would the Senate s action fall under the Constitution       ALITO    There are certain questions that seem perfectly clear  And I guess there s no harm in answering         GRAHAM    Is there any doubt in your mind the Constitution requires a majority vote to be on the Supreme Court or any other federal judicial office       ALITO    You know what  I remember this phrase from law school         GRAHAM    Is that a super duper precedent    LAUGHTER       ALITO    I think it s what we call in law school the slippery slope  and if you start answering the easy questions  you re going to be sliding down the ski run into the hard questions  And that s what I m not too happy to do       GRAHAM    That s what I tried to get to you do and I m glad you didn t do it    LAUGHTER       The bottom line through this exercise is  You ve got a job  I ve got a job  And what disturbs me a bit is that we re beginning to hold the lawyer responsible for the client       And in my remaining time here  what damage could be done to the legal profession or judiciary if people in my profession start holding your clients  position against the advocate       ALITO    I think it s been traditionally recognized that lawyers have an obligation to their clients  That s how our legal system works  Some lawyers have private clients  Some lawyers work for government agencies and the lawyer client relationship there is not exactly the same  But still there is a lawyer client relationship       And I think our whole system is based on the idea that justice is best served         GRAHAM    If you were an attorney general representing a state that passed a ban on partial birth abortion  would it be fair to that attorney general if they came before this committee to hold that against them if you disagreed with them on the subject matter       ALITO    I think that attorneys general    I can speak to the issue of the attorney general of the United States because I know there s a statute and there s an understanding about what the attorney general of the United States will do when an act of Congress is called into question  And the obligation of the attorney general is to defend the constitutionality of the act of Congress          CROSSTALK       GRAHAM    Lawyers  obligation is to defend their clients  interest  Is that an accurate statement of what a lawyer is supposed to do       ALITO    It certainly is  yes       GRAHAM    No matter where that client is popular or not or the position is popular or not   Is that correct       ALITO    Consistent with ethical obligations and professional responsibility  yes  indeed       GRAHAM    What s this process been like for you and your family  In a short period of time  could you tell us how to improve it       ALITO    Well  it s been a combination    at times it s been a thrill and at times it s been extremely disorienting  I ve spent the last 15 years as a judge on the court of appeals  And you probably could not think of a more cloistered existence than a judge on the court of appeals       Most of the time nobody other than the parties pays attention to what we do  When an article is written in the paper about one of our decisions  it s a federal appeals court in Philadelphia or in whatever city       And this has been a strange process for me  I made some reference to that yesterday       But I understand the reason for it  And I am reluctant in my current capacity as a nominee to offer any suggestions about the process  I think that you re carrying out your responsibility  I spoke about the fact that different people under the Constitution have different obligations  And you have the advice and consent function  Congress    the Senate does  And I think it s for the Senate to decide what it should do in this area       SPECTER    Thank you
