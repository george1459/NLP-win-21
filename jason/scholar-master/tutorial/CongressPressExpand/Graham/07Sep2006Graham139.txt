                     Discusses Military Tribunals and the Army Field Manual Lindsey Graham Interviewed on Fox News Channel  Speakers   U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina   Jon Scott  Fox News Channel  SCOTT     The president drew cheers yesterday when he named some of the suspected terrorists who have been held at Guantanamo Bay    transferred to Guantanamo Bay now to await trial   The president also announced a plan that calls  in part  for evidence to be withheld from defendants          Senator Lindsey Graham says he fears that would set a dangerous precedent the rest of the world would follow   He is among three Republican senators offering a revised proposal  one that guarantees that terrorist suspects get to see every bit of evidence gathered against them          Senator Graham joins us now          Senator  how big are your differences with the White House on this issue         GRAHAM     Really not that big   And there s a lot of confusion about this   There s two circumstances involving classified information   The defense can request classified information from the prosecution to prepare their case   I support the military lawyer s position here  the active duty lawyers  who say the government should not have to give to the defense classified information not relevant to the case and the judge can exclude any classified information the judge believes would harm national security          What they re talking about that s new and different  that I think is a bad idea  is for the government to give to the jury classified information about innocence or guilt  and the accused never know    never see what the jury sees  and he would be convicted not knowing what the evidence against him or her was   That could come back to haunt us          That s not necessary   I ve talked to the prosecutors at Guantanamo Bay   They don t need that   And  to me  that is a bridge too far   You say  no  to classified information to terrorists that would hurt national security  but if you re going to put somebody in jail  they need to confront the evidence against them   And that is what I stand for   That s what the military lawyers stand for   And that s the way we ve been doing it for 200 years         SCOTT     But  for instance  you say if it s relevant to their case they should be allowed to see it   Let s say some undercover informant who is  you know    is sort of becoming a traitor to his own organization  reveals some information   That would have to be revealed to these suspects  wouldn t it      GRAHAM     No  no  no  no   The military rules of evidence cover this very situation   A confidential informant does not have to be disclosed in the prosecution of the case if it would create serious risk or injury to the informant or it would compromise national security          The terrorists could ask for satellite positioning   The judge would review their request and would say national security interest overcome your need to know about satellites           We re not going to give the terrorists the information to harm this nation   The judge will decide what s relevant and what s not   That s the way we do it in our military legal system          On the other hand  if we create a legal system  where the accused goes to jail never knowing what the evidence against him was  what the jury looked at  then that would be a departure that s unnecessary  that would hurt our guys if they are tried in a foreign land   That s what the military lawyers say  it makes sense to me         SCOTT     The critics of the administration have said that it has used torture in obtaining information from some of these people   Are you concerned that some of these people have been tortured         GRAHAM     No   I understand very well what the Department of Defense has come out with in terms of the Army Field Manual   The Army Field Manual is a model for the world          The interrogation techniques that we have at Gitmo  I think  are the way to go   The way Gitmo is being run as a jail is probably the best run jail in the world   The American government doesn t torture people   Tortured evidence is unreliable   We do have aggressive interrogation techniques that fit within the rule of law          So I look forward to working with the administration to authorize a military commission that can bring these guys to trial   We ve got some of the nastiest people in the world down there for four years  None of them have been going to trial          The Supreme Court struck down the military commissions   I want to get them reauthorized  put these guys in trial   It want interrogation techniques that are effective that will protect us  that live within our value system  and we can do that working together  and we should have done it two years ago      SCOTT     All right   Senator Lindsey Graham  thank you      GRAHAM     Thank you
