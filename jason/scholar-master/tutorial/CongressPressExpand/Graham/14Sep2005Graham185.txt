                                                                               Senator Graham Press Relases Contact  Wes Hickman  202 224 5972  or Kevin Bishop  864 250 1417                                             Date  09 14 2005  Senator Graham Questions Chief Justice Nominee John Roberts on Third Day of Confirmation Hearings                                                                                                                                                                        GRAHAM  Thank you  Mr  Chairman        Judge Roberts  your intellectually stamina impresses me because you can t see this on television  It must be 150 degrees in here         LAUGHTER        And I just don t know how you re doing it  But I m tremendously impressed        Mr  Chairman  I would like permission to introduce into the record some law professor s opinion that being interviewed for the Supreme Court vacancy  when Judge Roberts was interviewed  did not require him to recuse himself and I ll          SPECTER  Without objection  it will be made a part of the record        GRAHAM  Well  let s think about that in kind of political terms  And I know that s not really your job        If we took this to its logical conclusion  say I was president    I don t think that s going to happen so you don t need to be overly worried about it but you could take someone to be chief justice from the people sitting on the court  Is that correct        ROBERTS  Yes        GRAHAM  So if you had a judge you didn t particularly like  the best thing you could do is go talk to him about the job and they couldn t decide anything  Would that be the logical conclusion of this        ROBERTS  I think that would be the logical conclusion          GRAHAM  Well  I ll remember that if I m president  But on the record now  I don t think I have the right to do that  That s part of the process  Some big things here  Were you proud to work for Ronald Reagan        ROBERTS  Very much  Senator  yes        GRAHAM  During your time of working with Ronald Reagan  were you ever asked to take a legal position that you thought was unethical or not solid        ROBERTS  No  Senator  I was not        GRAHAM  We talked about the Voting Rights Acts  Proportionality test in the Reagan administration s view was changing the Voting Rights Act to create its own harm  Is that correct        ROBERTS  The concern that the attorney general had and the president was that changing Section 2 to the so called effects test would cause courts to adopt a proportionality requirement  that if elected representatives were not elected in proportion to the racial composition in a particular jurisdiction  that there would be a violation shown that would have to be addressed        GRAHAM  Do you think it would be fair to try to suggest that because you supported that position but you re somehow racially insensitive        ROBERTS  No  Senator  And I would resist the suggestion that I m racially insensitive  I know why the phrase  Equal Justice Under Law is carved in marble above the Supreme Court entrance  It is because of the fundamental commitment of the rule of law to ensure equal justice for all people without regard to their race or ethnic background or gender        The courts are a place where people need to be able to go to secure a determination of their rights under the law in a totally unbiased way  That s a commitment all judges make when they take a judicial oath        GRAHAM  Knowing this will not this line of inquiry but  at least  trying to put my stamp on what I think we ve found from this long discussion  basically  the Supreme Court decided in Section 2 that the intent test was constitutionally sound  Is that correct        ROBERTS  That was its determination in Mobile against          GRAHAM  And Senator Kennedy disagreed because he wanted a different test  And I respect him  He is one of the great    first  he s not part of the Reagan revolution  I think we all can agree with that  So I don t expect him to buy into it        But I respect him greatly for his passion about his causes  He took it upon himself to try to change a Supreme Court ruling  to go away from the intent test to the effects test  and he was able to reach a political compromise with the administration       And I just want that to be part of the record  that to say that Ronald Reagan or Judge Roberts  by embracing a concept approved by the court  equates to that administration or this person being incensed at people of color in this country I think is very unfair and off base        You said something yesterday that was very compelling to me  I asked you  could you express or articulate what you thought might be one of the big threats to the rule of law  And I believe you said  Judges overstepping their boundaries  getting into the land of making the law  putting their social stamp on a cause  rather than interpreting the law  because that could over time  in the eyes of the public  undermine the confidence in the court        Is that a correct summary        Yes  Senator        GRAHAM  Well  we have before us today  Judge Roberts  a legal opinion just issued  hot off the presses  that says the establishment clause of the Constitution apparently is violated if an American recites the Pledge of Allegiance        You will be on the court  I hope  and you will use your best judgment on how to reconcile the 9th Circuit opinion  And I m not asking you to tell us how you might rule  I m making a personal observation that this is an example  in my opinion  of where judges do not protect us from having the government impose religion upon us  but declare war on all things religious        And that is my personal view and opinion  That s why most Americans sometimes are dumbfounded about what s going on in the name of religion  No American wants the government to tell them how to worship  where to worship or if to worship  But when we exercise our right to worship  it bothers me greatly that judges  who are unelected  confused the concept between establishment and free exercise        And I will move on        I think it is one of the cases that is undermining the confidence in the judiciary  And I m glad that you re sensitive to that        The war on terror  In my past legal life  I ve spent most of my legal career associated with the military  And I m proud to be a military lawyer  I m the only Reservist in the Senate  I sit as an Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals judge  I handle the easy cases  because I don t have a whole lot of time and I help where I can        But I understand  I think  very well what it means to abide by the judicial canons of ethics    not to tip your hand  not to compromise yourself to get promoted or to get put on the court  promoted in the military or to get put on the board  trying to please your boss  trying to please a senator        And my respect for you has gone up because you re unwilling to compromise your ethics  And I hope the Senate will understand that  in the past  other people were not required to do so        Are you familiar with the Geneva Convention        ROBERTS  Yes  Senator  GRAHAM  Do you believe that the Geneva Convention  as a body of law  that it has been good for America to be part of that convention        ROBERTS  I do  yes        GRAHAM  Why        ROBERTS  Well  my understanding in general is it s an effort to bring civilized standards to conduct of war    a generally uncivilized enterprise throughout history  an effort to bring some protection and regularity to prisoners of war in particular       And I think that s a very important international effort        GRAHAM  As Senator Kyl said  this will be the only time we get to talk  And I don t want to compromise your role as a judge  but I do want you to help me express some concepts here that America needs to be more understanding of        And I want to work with my Democratic friends to see if we can find some way to deal with us        We re dealing with an enemy that is not covered by the Geneva Convention  Al Qaida  by their very structure and nature  are not signatories to the Geneva Convention and are not covered under its dictates        An enemy combatant  Are you familiar with that term in the law        ROBERTS  Yes  Senator  I am        GRAHAM  What would an enemy combatant be under American jurisprudence  Who would they be        ROBERTS  Well  I really have          GRAHAM  Fair enough  Fair enough        ROBERTS  Those cases are both pending  The ones that I ve decided are pending before the Supreme Court and those issues are likely to come before          GRAHAM  Fair enough  The Geneva Convention doesn t cover Al Qaida  but or president has said that anyone in our charge  terrorist or not  will be treated humanely        I applaud the president  because  in fighting the war on terror  we need not become our enemy  Our strength as a nation is believing in the rule of law  even for the worst of those that we may encounter        I admire Mr  Adams for representing the Redcoats  I cannot imagine how tough that must have been  But his willingness to take on the unpopular cause in the name of the rule of law has made it stronger        When the president said that we will treat everyone humanely  even the worst of the worst  I think he s brought out the best in who we are        But we re in a war  Judge Roberts  where the Geneva Convention doesn t apply  And we have before the courts a line of cases dealing with the dilemma this country faces        When you capture an enemy combatant  non citizen  foreign terrorist  there s three things I think we must do  We must aggressively interrogate them without changing who we are  We must have the ability to keep them off the battlefield for a long period of time to protect our nation        And we must have a system to hold them accountable for some of the most horrible crimes imaginable        Justice Jackson was of your favorite justices  Is that correct        ROBERTS  I think that s a fair description  yes        GRAHAM  He has indicated in the Youngstown case that the presidency of the executive branch is at its strongest when it has concurrence with the legislative branch  Is that a fair summary of what he said        ROBERTS  Yes  He divided up the area basically into three parts  Considering the executive s authority  he said when it has the support of Congress it s at its greatest  and  obviously  when it s in opposition to Congress it s at its lowest ebb  as he put it  And he described a middle area in which it was sometimes difficult to tell whether Congress was supporting the action or not        GRAHAM  This is me speaking  not you        Congress is AWOL  ladies and gentlemen  in the war on terror when it comes to detention  interrogation and prosecution of enemy noncitizen combatants        Justice Scalia has written eloquently that Congress has the power to get involved in these issues and Congress is silent        What is the case  is it the Rasul case  where the Supreme Court in a 5 4 decision has given habeas corpus rights to noncitizen foreign terrorists        ROBERTS  I think that s correct  Senator        GRAHAM  That is an amazing departure from what we ve been as a nation for 200 years  I have been to Guantanamo Bay twice  The people running the prison tell me that 185 of detainees have lawyers in federal court  Justice Scalia says we ve set up a situation where 94 different jurisdictions can hear habeas cases involving noncitizen foreign terrorists  The people running the jail say this process is undermining out ability to get good information        A habeas corpus petition  would it allow a defense attorney to call a military commander in to answer for how this person was captured        ROBERTS  I don t know  Senator  and I hesitate to opine on that without knowing        GRAHAM  Well  the truth is that we ve set up a situation where our military leaders and our military commanders and soldiers in the field can be called from all over the world  all over the country  to answer for why such person is detained        We had a conversation in our office  my office  You said something to the effect  as Justice Scalia said in his dissenting opinion  that this would be an area where the courts would welcome some congressional involvement        And right now  we have the executive branch carrying the load totally by themselves  We ve got several cases before the court dealing with detention policy  interrogation policy and prosecution policy  Do you believe that this is an area  if the Congress acted  as Justice Jackson said  that it would strengthen the hand of the executive in a legal situation        ROBERTS  My observation during our meeting  Senator  was not an expression of legal determination  And it doesn t necessarily mean a view that Congress  action or involvement would be determinative or would even be within the scope of legal authority  depending on what the issue and the arguments were        I do know that when you are in the middle area  where it s difficult to determine whether Congress is supporting the president s action or is opposed to the president s action  that the court often has to try to read the tea leaves of related legislation        If you look at the Dames and Moore decision coming out of the Iranian hostage crisis  what the court did in that case  applying the middle tier  was look at a vast array of legislation  And it was a very difficult enterprise to try to figure out what Congress  view was        My point was simply that if we d know what Congress  view was  it might make it easier to apply it in a particular case  and you wouldn t have to go through that process of trying to determine what position Congress was in  if that turned out to be pertinent under the particular legal challenge        GRAHAM  Thank you        Justice Scalia said in a very direct way  The courts are ill  equipped to deal with these issues        In the Youngstown Steel case  Justice Jackson says  When the president acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress  his authority is at the maximum  for it includes all that he possesses in his own right  plus all that Congress can delegate        A seizure executed by the president pursuant to an act of Congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation  and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who may attack        Do you agree with that        ROBERTS  That was read from the Jackson    I do  I agree with the basic proposition that the president s authority is at its greatest when he has the support of Congress        GRAHAM  To my colleagues  I think it is imperative for this body to get involved in the war on terror when it comes to detaining  interrogating and prosecuting enemy combatants who are not citizens        It is important that all three branches of government  in my opinion  feel comfortable with the policies of this nation  that we ll be stronger if the judicial branch  the legislative branch and the executive branch are working together to come up with policies that will allow for aggressive interrogation  appropriate detention and serious prosecution in a way that s within the values of our nation        So that is why I will be introducing legislation on all those topics  And I will not ask you any further what you may or may not do about the legislation if it ever gets to the floor of the Senate and passed        The Kelo case  Of all the things that have been decided  and I haven t been to my office since the recent case about the pledge    though it may have trumped it    I have gotten more phone calls about the Kelo case than anything the Supreme Court has done lately        And for those who may be tuning in  the Kelo case basically said that the government can take your property  give it to someone else  another private person because it could be used at a higher and best use and it may generate more taxes        I m not going to ask you to tell me how you decide the Kelo case  But I just want you to know    as Senator Kyl indicated  this is the only time you can hear from us    that my phone is ringing off the hook and that every legislature that I know of is going into session as quickly as they can to correct that        So I want to leave with you    and when you meet your new colleagues  please let them know that some of the things they do that we watch  And that the courts are able to do their job because the public defers to the court and respects the court  but there is a limit        The office of chief justice of the United States is different  as you re the first among equals        What do you believe as chief justice you can bring to the table that you could not as just a normal member of the court        ROBERTS  Well  if I am confirmed  I think one of the things that the chief justice should have as a top priority is to try to bring about a greater degree of coherence and consensus in the opinions of the court        I know that has been    was a priority of the last chief justice  I actually believe that is something that should be a matter of concern for all of the justices  but as the chief  with responsibility for assigning opinions  I think he has greater scope for authority to exercise in that area and perhaps over time can develop greater persuasive authority to make the point        And again  coming from the chief it may be a point that other justices would receive    be more receptive to than they might coming from one of their colleagues  that we re not benefited by having six different opinions in a case  that we do need to take a step and think whether or not we really do feel strongly about a point in which a justice is writing a separate concurrence which only he or she is joining  or whether the majority opinion could be revised in a way that wouldn t affect anyone s commitment to the judicial oath to decide the cases as they see fit  but would allow more justices to join the majority so the court speaks as a court        That is something that the priority should be  to speak as a court        GRAHAM  So your goal as chief justice is where you can  and as often as you can  define consensus and unite the court  is that true        ROBERTS  I think the court should be as united behind an opinion of the court as it possibly can       Now  obviously  in many cases it s not going to be possible        GRAHAM  I applaud you because we re a divided nation  and the more united we can become at any level of government  the stronger we ll be  So I applaud you for that attitude                                                       September 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
