year we are confronted with major budget cuts and find ourselves fighting for level funding   I felt it was important to bring the key players in the room to discuss long term funding strategies for cleanup and future missions   We had a very productive meeting and I appreciate Secretary Bodman and Director Portman  s work in helping move the MOX program and cleanup efforts forward   We discussed various technical  regulatory  and funding issues affecting current and future operations of the Site   We all share the same goal of moving forward with the MOX program and continuing our cleanup efforts in the most efficient  safe  technically sound  and cost effective manner possible   I think today  s meeting was a positive development and will help us achieve our common goals in the future             I believe our message was well received by Secretary Bodman and Director Portman     said Chambliss    They both understand the national importance of the Savannah River Site  The meeting provided us an opportunity to present the case for a stable  robust funding stream for the Savannah River Site  I was pleased to hear of the Administration  s strong support for moving forward with the MOX program and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure this critical program is funded             Secretary Bodman has clearly focused much of his time on MOX and the Site  s cleanup  and I  m encouraged he says the Site is one of his highest priorities     said DeMint     Director Portman  s experience on these issues and willingness to work with the state delegations makes me optimistic we can put the Site on a stable and predictable path             I was pleased to join with my colleagues from Georgia and South Carolina in presenting a unified message on the Savannah River Site cleanup     said Isakson    We had a very productive meeting and reiterated the importance of the MOX program and the need to continue our cleanup efforts            I appreciate Senator Graham coordinating this meeting and bringing all parties to the table     said Wilson     The future of the Savannah River Site is of vital importance to the people of the Second

Bodman and Director Portman are in full cooperation  and I am confident this meeting was a step in the right direction          It was necessary to bring everyone together and talk about long term strategies for the site  and I appreciate Senator Graham taking the lead and making that happen   said Barrett    I feel good about the direction we are headed   We are all on the same page as it relates to moving MOX forward and ensuring the clean up efforts continue in a way that is both safe and cost effective  There is no doubt that the SRS has a lot to offer South Carolina and the country
