                                                                                            WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today joined with Senator Charles Schumer  D New York  to introduce legislation placing a 27 5 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the United States          The tariff legislation is in response to China  s decision to continue pegging their currency at a rate of 8 28 yuan to  1 American dollar            It  s pretty simple    China cheats     said Graham     They artificially peg their currency below its true value making their goods cheaper            Words alone will not change China s behavior     said Graham     We ve talked this issue to death  It is now time to act           Economists have estimated the yuan may be undervalued by 15 to 40 percent   China intentionally lowers their currency s value making their goods and services cheap internationally   When Chinese manufacturers export a product  it receives a 15 percent to 40 percent discount which provides them with a nearly insurmountable advantage over U S  producers          It  s not about being outworked  or being smarter than the American worker  it  s really about American companies fighting the Chinese government     said Graham     I think most American consumers want to make sure that American businesses are protected             This is a common ground between Republicans and Democrats  supported by the American manufacturing community     said Graham     It  s my belief that if the bill goes to the floor of the U S  Senate  it will pass             The Schumer Graham legislation gives China ample time to make the necessary  structural changes to the valuation of their currency     said Graham     If China wants to be part of the international community  it  s time for them to clean up their act   Until they are reigned in and start playing by the rules  our manufacturing industry will continue to bleed jobs because of unfair Chinese trade practices             We need to have a policy of engagement with China that is serious across the board     said Graham     Intellectual property theft  manipulating currency  transshipping goods    there is a variety of activities they engage in that are costing us jobs in the United States    We need to address all of these issues   The tariff bill is a good way to get the Chinese  s attention and show them we are very serious about their cheating                      Summary of the Legislation    The legislation helps American workers by addressing the growing problem of China s deliberate undervaluing of its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage   It encourages negotiation with China to level the playing field so that China s goods compete at their true market value        The legislation reduces the export advantage provided by China s unfairly and illegally undervalued currency     After a six month negotiation period between the US and China  if such negotiations are not successful  the amendment would institute a 27 5 percent tariff on all China s exports to the United States that is symmetrical to China s currency advantage   Most economists estimate China s currency is undervalued between 15 percent and 40 percent  27 5 percent is at the midpoint of that range   This tariff would apply across the board to products from China and would lay on top of any current tariffs that may apply           If the President determines after 6 months that China is making significant progress towards revaluing its currency  he may delay imposition of the tariff for another 6 months   At the end of the second 6 months  if the President determines that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  he may delay imposition of the tariff for another 12 months        Provides the President with the authority to remove the tariff     The President could remove the tariff once he certifies to Congress that China has agreed to substantially revalue its currency upwards to  at or near its fair market value     The legislation does not specify that China adopt a free floating currency  which many argue could further destabilize the Chinese banking system       Establishes a reasonable time period for negotiations     The legislation authorizes sanctions to begin 180 days after enactment  which allows the Secretary of the Treasury  in consultation with the US Trade Representative  and others a full six months to work with the Chinese Government to institute currency reforms       Works within the framework of international trade laws     Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade allows a member of the World Trade Organization to take  any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests   particularly  in time of war or other emergency in international relations    Our nation s manufacturing capability is a vital national interest and we believe it is threatened by China s unfair currency practices                                                         February 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
