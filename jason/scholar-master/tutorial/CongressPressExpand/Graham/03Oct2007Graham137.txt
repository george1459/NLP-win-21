Russia and Rush Limbaugh  SEN  LINDSEY GRAHAM IS INTERVIEWED ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL    OCTOBER 3  2007   BILL HEMMER  FOX NEWS CHANNEL      Back to this developing situation in the skies near  Alaska    Only yesterday  we showed you new videotape of U S  jets intercepting Russian bombers wandering dangerously close to  U S   airspace  A rare look now from the cockpit of an F 15      Now  the Air Force has been dealing with these stray bombers since August  And  U S   defense officials say these incidents are on the rise  adding they have not seen this many Russian flights this close since the Cold War   Lindsey Graham  Republican senator  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  with me now from D C  Senator  good morning  and welcome back  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM     Good morning  Bill  HEMMER     Help me with this  What does  Russia  get out of these flights  Senator   GRAHAM     Well  it s    they have this view that they re re emerging as a stronger power but actually they re diminishing themselves   You know  this idea of re engaging America and the West in a Cold War mentality is a big loser for  Russia   They re trying to intimidate their neighbors who are joining in NATO  These flights are just a kind of a flex the muscle approach to foreign policy  That s not going to work   Every institution in  Russia  has been degraded under Putin  the legal system  the parliament  the press  So this is becoming a autocratic country  much to the  I think  detriment of the Russian people   HEMMER     You used a word in there  You said diminished  Why are they diminished  GRAHAM     Well  because Putin has rolled back democratic reforms  These flights have not occurred since 1992  He is trying to now run for prime minister  He s diminished the Duma  the parliament  when he was president  The legal system is pretty much of a joke  The press has no freedom in  Russia   They censor reports about their government  And these flights are just another saber rattling episode   He s fishing in a stream without a shirt  It s kind of like the whole country s going through a mid life crisis  HEMMER     Well  that s a statement right out of  South Carolina    I must add there    LAUGHTER  You don t seem to be concerned about this  do you  GRAHAM     I m not  I m not  because I know the strength of our country is the institutions we have are bigger than personalities   We should be concerned about  Russia   but not afraid   Remember the bear in the wood commercial that Ronald Reagan ran in 1980 against the  Soviet Union     HEMMER     I sure do  GRAHAM     Well  this is a cub in the woods    Russia  is really a weak  struggling country trying to have bravado through one man that is short sighted  They could be a very key player in the international community  a constructive force  They could help us with  Iran   But they re choosing to go a different path  And that will result in a weaker  Russia  over time   So we have to convince them    HEMMER     With global energy prices  too  one argue that their economy s on the boost too  and they re creating billionaires by the day over there in  Moscow      GRAHAM     Right    HEMMER     Another topic now  The Senate majority leader  Harry Reid  is hitting hard back at Rush Limbaugh  And I know you ve heard the back  and forth between Limbaugh and what has being said in the Senate and Media Matters  this group that really put the headline on the story two days ago      What are we to make of the back and forth and why the Senate is taking the position it is  at least on the Democratic side     GRAHAM     We can clearly understand that the MoveOn org ad really stunned the Democrats  and they re trying to create a bogeyman on the right to make up for what was clearly an effort by the left to diminish and to bring into question the patriotism of General Petraeus    HEMMER     So you re saying the Betray Us ad  this is payback because of that    GRAHAM     Well  it s an attempt at payback  But from what I can see  based on the record available to us  Rush Limbaugh was talking about two people who claimed to be in  Iraq  when they were not  who claimed to be participating in atrocities that never occurred  And they re trying to spin that out into something else  And it s feeble attempt to change the subject     HEMMER     Lindsey Graham  thank you for your time     GRAHAM     Thank you                                                      October 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
