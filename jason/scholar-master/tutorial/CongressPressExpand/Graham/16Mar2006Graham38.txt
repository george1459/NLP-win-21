                                                                               Senator Graham Press Relases Contact  Wes Hickman  202 224 5972  or Kevin Bishop  864 250 1417  Date  03 16 2006  DEWINE  GRAHAM  HAGEL   SNOWE INTRODUCE THE   TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 2006                                                                                                                                                                                         Today  Senators Mike DeWine  R OH   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Olympia Snowe  R ME  introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006  a measure that would provide a statutory framework  with congressional and judicial oversight for the President to conduct electronic surveillance on the international communications of suspected terrorists  while protecting the rights and liberties of American citizens          As the President has said  when terrorists call the United States  we want to know who they  re talking to   This bill gives the President the limited authority to do just that     said Senator DeWine  a member of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee    It does not  however  give the President a blank check   The Terrorist Surveillance Act authorizes a limited  but necessary  program   It requires the President to go to court as soon as possible   And  it establishes an unprecedented Subcommittee with the power to oversee this program and protect the rights and liberties of American citizens             My goal is to ensure the spying program  which has been effective and vital to our national security  is able to continue by ensuring we have the appropriate checks and balances in place     said Senator Graham     I believe our legislation strikes that balance and will allow us to continue monitoring the enemy while protecting the rights of American citizens              As communications technology and the terrorist threat evolve  we must ensure the security of the nation by updating our laws  This legislation creates a 21st century law to address 21st century threats   said Senator Hagel  a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence   We cannot lose our focus on national security  But we must not forget the critical roll that the legislative and judicial branches play in the governance of this nation  This bill ensures substantive Congressional oversight and reinforces the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court             Today  I join with my colleagues    Senators DeWine  Graham and Hagel    in introducing legislation to bring the NSA  s surveillance program out of the shadows by reasserting the necessary constitutional checks and balances that both the legislative and judicial branches government have over the Executive   Information is the bedrock of this legislation   The more we learn about the NSA program  the better we are able to adopt measures necessary to protect our treasured constitutional rights without sacrificing our safety as a nation   This legislation is the first of many steps  but one that is critical to safeguarding our security and freedom     said Senator Snowe        Under the Terrorist Surveillance Act  the President is given the limited authority to conduct surveillance of the international communications of terrorists for 45 days   To engage in such surveillance  the President must have probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance is a member of or affiliated with a terrorist organization   And  he must believe that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States from a terrorist attack   Under the bill  the President is permitted to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program every 45 days            To ensure that the President does not overstep his limited authority  the Terrorist Surveillance Act adds important safeguards to current law to protect the rights and liberties of ordinary Americans         The bill mandates that the President obtain a warrant for surveillance on a suspected terrorist once he has sufficient evidence to do so         For those unusual cases where the President does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a court order  but still wishes to conduct surveillance on a suspect  the bill requires that the Attorney General certify  under oath  that continued surveillance is necessary to protect the United States         Finally  the bill establishes a Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittee within the Senate Intelligence Committee with the exclusive jurisdiction to oversee and monitor the details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program   That Subcommittee is empowered to obtain any and all information about the surveillance of any individual in order to ensure that the President is not abusing the rights of law abiding Americans                 Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006   DeWine  Graham  Hagel  Snowe       The Terrorist Surveillance Act provides limited statutory authority to the President to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States  greatly enhances Congressional oversight of the Terrorist Surveillance Program  and requires that electronic surveillance be conducted under FISA when the President has sufficient evidence to do so         Authorizes the President to conduct an electronic surveillance program  without court order  for up to 45 days  provided that      The President determines that the surveillance is necessary to protect the United States  its citizens  or its interests      Protections are in place to ensure that the program is reasonably designed to acquire only international communications      There is probable cause to believe that at least one party to a communication is a member of  affiliated with  or working in support of a terrorist organization   The President must submit a list of designated terrorist organizations at least annually  and     Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition  retention and use of non public information about U S  persons       Requires Program Review and Reauthorization Every 45 Days  Every 45 days  the Attorney General must review the program and certify in writing and under oath whether the program meets the requirements set forth by Congress      The President may then reauthorize the program for another 45 day period  but only if he determines that the program remains necessary to protect the United States  its citizens  or its interests        The Attorney General must provide notice of the decision to continue or terminate the program to the congressional intelligence committees within 72 hours      Requires Review of Surveillance of Individual Targets Every 45 Days  Every 45 days  the Attorney General must also review the surveillance of any individual targets under the program        If  at any time  the Attorney General determines that he has sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA warrant  he must seek a FISA warrant to continue surveillance on that target      If the Attorney General determines that he does not have sufficient evidence to obtain a FISA warrant  but nonetheless wants to continue surveillance  then he must certify in writing and under oath to the Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees the following four things       1       that all previous surveillance complied with this Act       2       that there is insufficient evidence to obtain a warrant under FISA       3       that the President has determined that continued surveillance of the target without a court order is necessary to protect the United States  its citizens  or its interests  and      4       that continued surveillance is being undertaken in a good faith belief that it will result in the acquisition of foreign intelligence information      No target may be subject to surveillance beyond the 45 day reauthorization period unless the Attorney General obtains a FISA warrant or files a certification  in writing and under oath  with the Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees        Regular  Ongoing  and Vigorous Oversight of Terrorist Surveillance Program   The Act calls for the creation of Terrorist Surveillance Subcommittees within both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees         To ensure confidentiality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program  these Subcommittees  along with bipartisan congressional leadership  will have sole oversight responsibilities of this program       The President must submit information on the management and operational details of the Terrorist Surveillance Program generally and any specific surveillance conducted by this program whenever requested by the Subcommittees      Every 6 months  the President must also submit a report to the Subcommittees  which  among other things  will include       1       A complete discussion of the management  operational details  effectiveness  and necessity of the program and all electronic surveillance conduced under the program during the 6 month period       2       Total number of United States persons targeted for electronic surveillance       3       For any targets subject to surveillance for longer than 45 days  an explanation why the target was subject to continued surveillance without a FISA warrant  and      4       A description of the nature of the information sought under the program  the types of communications subject to the program and whether the information could have been reasonably obtained by less intrusive investigative techniques     Program Sunset  5 years         Enhanced penalties for disclosure of classified information related to the Terrorist Surveillance Program  Maximum fine of  1 million and or 15 years in prison   This provision does not apply to journalists                                                                 March 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
