being said about Immigration Reform   New York Times Editorial says Graham Amendment Creates Gitmos Across America to Hold Illegal Immigrants One of the worst amendments comes from Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina  It would impose mandatory detention of all people who overstay their visas  The cells would be full of people who shouldnt be there  asylum seekers  the elderly  pregnant women  the sick and those ensnared in paperwork mistakes  Children  like the kindergartners in inmate scrubs walking the halls of a federal detention center outside Austin  Tex  Day laborers  like those in suburban Brewster  N Y   whose arrests were hailed by a mayor who spoke proudly of his communitys zero tolerance for people unlawfully playing soccer in a schoolyard  The country already detains some 230 000 immigrants a year  at an annual cost of  1 2 billion  Under the current immigration bill  it would build tens of thousands more beds to hold detainees  And it would need many more  Guantnamo Bays across America  if Mr  Grahams zero tolerance vision is fully realized  Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce Supports Immigration Reform Immigration reform is a federal issue and we support efforts to achieve a national solution to this challenge to support a uniform approach  We oppose any local approach to regulating immigration on the basis that regulation must be consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  We need immigration laws that are fair and balanced  These laws must meet the needs of our growing economy and the test of common sense  Only through this kind of comprehensive approach can an effective solution be reached  Securing the national borders is important  but it cannot be accomplished in isolation  Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce Supports Immigration Reform The current system is clearly broken and we believe the status quo is unacceptable  Municipalities and counties throughout South Carolina  as well as our state government  are reacting to a lack of action at the federal level with a patchwork of immigration laws and enforcement  We fear that local mandates and piecemeal approaches will be unnecessarily costly and expose law abiding employers to unfair liability  This would ultimately undermine our economic strength and negatively impact our station and our nation  Charleston Post  Courier Editorial Revive Immigration Reform The Senate shouldn t heed ill informed foes of the immigration bill  but rather the general public s agreement on realistic reform  The bill s foes should abandon legislative obstructionism and offer practical counter proposals  Otherwise  we ll again be stuck with the illegal immigration status quo  a de facto amnesty  Washington Times Labor Groups  Hispanics hit Senate bill Labor and Hispanic groups yesterday told senators to scrap their immigration bill and go back to the drawing board  saying that the proposal now before the Senate has become too harsh on illegal aliens and a poor deal for U S  workers  Washington Times Says New Study Shows Senate Bill Breaking Chain Migration a new evaluation released by the Migration Policy Institute  MPI  yesterday found that the Senate bill would reduce family based immigration from about two thirds of current permanent visas to less than half  Employment based visas would go from less than one fifth to about two fifths  The MPI evaluation said the new point system called for in the bill would also shift the profile of new legal immigrants away from Latin American and Caribbean countries and toward Asian countries  particularly India  China and the Philippines  where recent immigrants have had better English skills and higher educational attainment  Fox News Channel Brit Hume on Fox News Sunday What strikes me about this argument that s made by the opponents of the bill is that they can t really dispute that there s a lot of good stuff in here and strong stuff on border enforcement  And what they say  when you cite that to them  is they say  Well  we don t believe them  which is the point Charles  Krauthammer  is making  We don t believe it  On the other hand  I wonder if you put the question to them  if this was only border enforcement stuff  would you be for passing that and spending  4 4 billion  and how many more billions of dollars that it might cost to do it    I assume the answer would be yes  to which my question would be  Well  why would you be for that if you don t believe it  U S  Chamber Of Commerce  National Restaurant Association  Business Roundtable  National Association of Manufacturers  NAM   And National Federation Of Independent Business  NFIB  As trade associations representing the full spectrum of the American economy  we applaud the hard work of a bipartisan team of senators and the Administration for their role in crafting S 1348  We realize that many difficult issues will remain  but it is critical that the process moves forward  American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman on the Immigration Bill Farmers need a comprehensive immigration reform bill approved this Congress      We have been pushing for a solution for years and we simply cannot wait any longer for Congress to address this issue                                                         June 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
