                                                                               Senator Graham Press Relases Contact  Wes Hickman   or Kevin Bishop   Date  11 12 2006  Where Do Republicans Go From Here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tuesday was a bad night for Republicans in Washington   However  if we learn from our mistakes the fortunes of the Republican Party and the nation can quickly improve       Rather than Democrats winning  Republicans lost   Voters didn  t pick a Democratic over Republican agenda   On many fronts  Republicans confused voters about what we stand for         Voters were not happy with the way we conducted ourselves when it comes to spending their hard earned tax dollars or efforts to ensure we have a successful outcome in the War on Terror   They made it clear we  ve spent too much time talking about problems and not enough solving them       If there  s one lesson to be learned from Tuesday night it is Republicans win when we act like Republicans   We get into trouble when we don  t         Some of our successes such as cutting taxes  appointing conservative Supreme Court and federal court judges  banning partial birth abortion  and class action and bankruptcy reform were washed away by corruption scandals and fiscally irresponsible behavior       Iraq did play a part   However  we must remember Senator Joe Lieberman was elected as an Independent in a very blue state despite his support for the war   Connecticut voters may have disagreed with his war position but they believe he took a principled stand putting the best interests of the country above political party      Conversely  many Americans believe the Republican majority chose self interest over the common good       Here  s a roadmap for Republicans to reconnect with voters             Budget reform and tax simplification are top priorities   We should push for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution to rein in Congress   insatiable spending appetite   We should also seek a two year budget cycle allowing for more spending oversight              Rein in the runaway practice of congressional earmarks which exploded on our watch   Alaska  s Bridge to Nowhere    a  250 million bridge to benefit 50 people    is a classic example of how we  ve lost our way   Also  reforming earmarking and debating all budget items in public will deny corrupt lobbyists and politicians the dark corners in which they operate               Because of President Bush  s tax cuts for families and small business owners  the jobless rate is at a five year low and 6 8 million new jobs have been added since August of 2003   Our national economy is humming   We must push congressional Democrats to ensure the tax cuts are extended and the benefits of tax relief continue in coming years             We need to return to Social Security reform   President Bush deserves credit for taking on this issue which must be solved for future generations of Americans   We should put all options on the table including innovation to solve Social Security  s looming bankruptcy   Hopefully  Democrats in the majority will feel the need to be constructive and say more than   NO    to solutions which lead to Social Security solvency               Solve our immigration problems   Legislation should include better border security  employment verification requirements  punishment for those in the country illegally and a guest worker program   Both amnesty and the idea we are going to deport 12 million people should be rejected as unworkable  impractical solutions             We must become energy independent   Our reliance on Middle East oil poses a threat to our economy and creates national security concerns as well   Global climate change is real and nuclear energy  hydrogen  and other alternative sources of energy provide us an opportunity to address both national security and environmental concerns             The War in Iraq is front and center in our efforts to win the global War on Terror   We need to make a World War II commitment to winning in Iraq and ensure the American people fully understand what is on the line should we fail   Unfortunately  we have treated Iraq more as a police action than the central battlefront               We need more troops on the ground in Iraq to improve the security situation  enlist sympathetic nations in the region to take ownership of the outcome  and push the Iraqi leadership to move quickly to take over control of the country   Failure in Iraq empowers Iran and will lead to regional chaos              We need another 50 000 troops in the Army and Marine Corps and we must provide them with better benefits   Our soldiers are promoting freedom throughout the world and serving admirably in hot spots like Afghanistan and Iraq   We also have security concerns about dangerous situations in North Korea and Iran   We need more troops in uniform to help relieve pressure on our soldiers being sent overseas on deployment with increasing frequency and for longer periods of time         During difficult times the country deserves bold leadership on tough issues  The Republican Party  if it adjusts and chooses  is capable of providing that leadership   We will be fine in future elections if we return to these core principles        NOTE  This article appeared in South Carolina newspapers beginning Sunday
