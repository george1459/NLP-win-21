                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  has introduced legislation designed to reign in costs of the Medicare prescription drug bill          U S  Senator Jeff Sessions  R Alabama  has signed on as a co sponsor          As we try to improve senior  s health care we cannot do it in a way that will doom their grandchildren with debts they cannot afford to pay     said Graham     I was always concerned the projected costs of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit would turn out to be wrong   Even I was surprised at how quickly and dramatically the projected costs of the program spiked   I  m afraid this isn  t going to be the last bit of bad news we receive about the long term costs of this new entitlement           The new benefit was initially estimated to cost  395 billion over the next ten years when the bill passed Congress and was signed into law by President Bush in December 2003   A mere two months after becoming law  the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  revised the figure and projected the bill to cost an estimated  534 billion   This week  a Congressional Budget Office report pushed the cost to  849 billion over the next 10 years        The Medicare Prescription Drug Cost Containment Act of 2005 would place a cap on the program  s expenditures equal to Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates for fiscal years 2005 2013  and allow for reasonable growth after that   Should the Medicare actuaries determine that the cap has been exceeded in any fiscal year the President would be required to submit to Congress legislation to reduce the cost of the Prescription Drug Benefit        Graham proposes controlling the long term costs of the program by       Placing caps on Medicare prescription drug outlays   The caps would be equal to the estimate of outlays for Prescription Drug Benefit for Fiscal Years  FY  2005 2013 as estimated by CBO           The caps for FY 2005 2013   2005      800 million  program not in full effect       2006      25 7 billion      2007      39 0 billion      2008      44 6 billion      2009      48 7 billion      2010      53 7 billion      2011      58 6 billion      2012      65 3 billion      2013      73 1 billion      Requiring the President to submit legislation to Congress reducing the costs of the prescription drug benefit upon determination the cap will be exceeded in any fiscal year   The President  s legislation would be considered on a fast track basis and could not be amended or filibustered   Failure by a President to submit legislation would allow any Senator to move to discharge from the Finance Committee any Medicare reform legislation to lower the cost of the drug benefit         The prescription drug benefit was tacked on to an already broken Medicare program without underlying reform     said Graham     We have a responsibility to protect future generations from overbearing deficits and look at ways to reign in spending and modernize entitlement programs             I want seniors to have a prescription drug benefit  but I  m not prepared to do it at all costs     said Graham     The Medicare prescription drug benefit  as it  s currently structured  allows uncontrolled expansion that may topple the entire system                                                                         March 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
