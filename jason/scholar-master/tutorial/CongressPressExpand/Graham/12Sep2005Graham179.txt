John Roberts to the United States Supreme Court   Graham is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee        He said          Thank you  Mr  Chairman  Thanks for the seventh inning stretch  too  We all very much appreciate it        Judge Roberts  playing a little bit off of what my colleague Senator Feingold said  I don t think you expected it to be easy   Having to listen to 18 senators proves the fact that it s not going to be easy        But I hope we will live up to our end of the bargain to make it fair  Fair is something that comes around in September in South Carolina or it can be an idea  The idea of treating you fairly is very important to me because not only are you on display  but the Senate s on display        Senator Kennedy said something that I disagree with  but he s very passionate in his statement  He said the central issue is whether or not you will embrace policies  a certain set of policies  or whether or not you will roll back certain policy decisions        I respectfully disagree with Senator Kennedy  To me  the central issue before the Senate is whether or not the Senate will allow President Bush to fulfill his campaign promise to appoint a well  qualified  strict constructionist to the Supreme Court   And    in this case    appoint a Chief Justice to the Supreme Court in the mold of Justice Rehnquist        He s been elected president twice   He has not hidden from the public what his view of a Supreme Court justice should be and the philosophy they should embrace   In my opinion    by picking you    he has lived up to his end of the bargain with the American people by choosing a well qualified  strict constructionist        You have been described as brilliant  talented and well  qualified  and that s by Democrats   The question is  is that enough in 2005 to get confirmed  Maybe not        Professor Michael Gerhardt wrote an article in 2000 called The Federal Appointments Process  and I think he has given some advice to our Democratic friends in the past and  maybe recently  about the confirmation process that we re engaged in today   He has written  the Constitution establishes a presumption of confirmation that works to the advantage of the president and his nominee        I agree with that  Elections matter        We re not here to debate how to solve all the nation s problems  We re not here to talk about liberal philosophy versus conservative philosophy and what s best for the country  We re here to talk about you and whether or not you are qualified to sit on the Supreme Court  whether or not you have the intellect  the integrity and the character        It has been said in the past by members of this committee    Senator Kennedy    I believe    it s recognized by most senators that we re not charged with a responsibility of approving justices if their views always coincide with our own  We re really interested in knowing whether a nominee has the background  experience  qualifications  temperament  integrity to handle the most sensitive  important and responsible job  And that s being on the Supreme Court        If you re looking for consistency  you ve probably come to the wrong place  because the truth of the matter is that we re all involved in the electoral process ourselves and we have different agendas        Your memos are going to be talked about  The memos you wrote while you were working for President Reagan and Bush 1  in my opinion  reflect a conservative lawyer advising a conservative president about conservative policies        To some  those policies make no sense  those policies are out of the mainstream   But this hearing is about whether or not you re qualified   Not whether Reagan conservatism is in the mainstream        Does affirmative action require quotas   From a conservative point of view  no  From a conservative point of view  we don t want federal judges setting the value of someone s wages from the bench  You wrote about that  Now  some people want that  but conservatives don t        Environmental policies  We want a clean environment  but we don t want to ruin the economy in the process  We want to be able to build levees to protect cities        Conservatives have a different view of a lot of issues versus our friends on the other side  The election determines how that shakes out  We re here to determine whether or not you and all you ve done in your life makes you a fitting candidate to be on the Supreme Court        Before we got here  the Senate was in disarray  May 23rd of this year  I engaged in a compromise agreement with seven Democrats and seven Republicans to keep the Senate from blowing itself up  You re the first nomination that we ve dealt with in any significant manner after that agreement        There s plenty of blame to go around  Judge Roberts  On our watch  I m sure we did things in committee that were very unfair to Democrat nominees  particularly by President Clinton  At the time of that agreement  there were 10 people being filibustered  for the first time in the history of the Senate  in a partisan manner  that were going to be on the court of appeals        We were in chaos  We were at each other s throats  Since May 23rd  we ve done better        The Senate has gotten back to a more traditional role when it comes to judges  As Senator Specter described the committee  we ve done some good things on this committee and in the Senate as a whole   I hope we will take the chance to start over because the public approval of the Senate now is in the 30s  That  s not your fault  Judge Roberts  it s our fault        We have an opportunity as senators to show we can disagree based on philosophy but give you a fair shake  The question is whether we ll rise to the occasion  I m hopeful we will based on the statements being made        What is the standard for a senator to confirm a Supreme Court nominee  Whatever the senator wants it to be  And  really  that s the way it should be   But there should be some goals  in my opinion  The way we conduct ourselves  one of the goals we should have  is to make sure we don t run good people away from wanting to be a judge        I don t know what it s like to sit at home and turn on the television and watch a commercial about you in the presence of your wife and your kids that say some pretty unflattering things  That s just not a problem you ve faced   I m sure Democratic nominees have faced the same type problem        We shouldn t  in our standard  be trying to come up with a standard to invalidate elections  The president won  The president told us what he s going to do and he did it  He picked a strict constructionist to be on the Supreme Court  If anybody is surprised  they weren t listening to the last campaign        Roe v  Wade  It divides America  If you believe in polling  most Americans would like to see the decision stand even though we re divided 50 50 on the idea of abortion on demand        My good friend from California has expressed a view about Roe v  Wade which I completely understand and respect  I can just tell you  Judge Roberts  there are plenty of women in South Carolina who have an opposite view about abortion        If we were to make our votes  base our votes on that one principle  Justice Ginsburg would not be Justice Ginsburg  In her writing  she embraced the idea of federal funding for abortion  She indicated that an abortion right was based on the equal protection clause of the Constitution        I dare say 90 percent of the Republican Caucus is pro life  I dare say 90 percent of the Democratic Caucus is pro choice  Justice Ginsburg got 96 votes even though she expressed a view of the federal government s role in abortion that I completely disagree with and I think most conservatives disagree with        There was a time not too long ago  Judge Roberts  where it was about the way you lived your life  how you conducted yourself  what kind of lawyer you were  what kind of man or woman you were  not whether you had an allegiance to a specific case or a particular cause        Let s get back to those days   Let s get back to the days where the Ginsburg  s and the Scalia  s can be pushed and pressed  but they can be honored for their commitment to the law and the way they live their life        Let s get back to the good old days where we understood that we were looking for well qualified people to sit on the highest court of the land    not political clones of our own philosophy        The reason I signed the agreement more than anything else was that I love the law   The role of the law in our society is so important   You take out the rule of law and you don t have a democracy   The law  Judge Roberts  to me  represents a quiet place in American discourse        Politics is a loud  noisy and destructive place  But the courtroom is a quiet place where the weak can challenge the strong and the unpopular can be heard        I know you will honor the rule of law in our country and that you will be a judge that we all can be proud of        God bless you and your family                   Note   Audio of Senator Graham s
