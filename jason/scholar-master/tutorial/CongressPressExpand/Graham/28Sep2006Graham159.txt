                          WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today said he was pleased the U S  Senate and House of Representatives have passed legislation he helped draft establishing the trials of terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba and providing legal infrastructure for the War on Terror   The legislation will now be sent to President Bush for his signature         From the beginning President Bush and I shared the same goal     said Graham     Now  I  m proud to say the President and a decisive majority in Congress agree on the path to get there           I  m very pleased the military trials of terrorists    which have been put on hold for years    will finally be allowed to move forward and justice will be rendered     said Graham     We were able to give the President  the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   and the military the tools they need to continue protecting us from a vicious enemy   We accomplish these goals without abandoning our national values  Geneva Convention obligations  or the rule of law           Graham noted the major elements of the legislation include             Protecting President Bush  s CIA program for High Value Targets  HVT  by allowing aggressive interrogation techniques    classified in nature    that will continue to yield good information protecting us from terrorists   The legislation gives the CIA the clarity they needed regarding interrogation techniques and for the first time clearly defined what constitutes a   grave breach   of the Geneva Convention   By accomplishing this goal  the CIA can move forward with their program in a manner consistent with our international obligations and our values             Prohibiting terror suspects and others from suing CIA agents or their families for doing their jobs             Prevents terror suspects from filing lawsuits in federal court   Federal judges will be allowed to conduct limited review of certain legal issues but will not be able to take over military decisions determining who is and who is not an enemy combatant              Establishing military tribunals in a manner consistent with our national values and demonstrating America is rendering justice  not vengeance   The military tribunal system protects our nation  s secrets in an unprecedented manner while at the same time allowing defendants the ability to confront evidence against them   To do otherwise  would run the serious risk of the Supreme Court rejecting the legislation   The legislation achieves the correct balance between protecting our nation in this war without setting precedent that could jeopardize our troops in future wars         The Supreme Court ruled terrorist enemy combatants were covered by the Geneva Convention     said Graham     While President Bush and I did not agree with their ruling it was incumbent upon us to comply with their decision   A conviction against a terror suspect in a military tribunal is no good if it is later overturned by the Supreme Court            I  m proud of the role I played in drafting the legislation and believe my years of military legal experience helped identify problem areas and bring about constructive solutions     said Graham     I would not have been doing my job as Senator if I saw a problem with the President  s proposal    which I did    and didn  t work to address it in a constructive manner           I also do not believe judges should be making military decisions in a time of war     said Graham     There is a reason the Germans and Japanese in World War II  and every other prisoner held by America  have never gone to federal court and asked a judge to determine their status   This is not a role the judiciary should be playing   They are not trained to make those decisions            I  m tremendously pleased with the overwhelming support for the compromise     said Graham     The legislative and executive branches have now come together in a decisive fashion to provide the legal infrastructure necessary to fight and win the War on Terror   However  I will not be completely satisfied until our work product is approved by the judiciary   They are the final piece of the puzzle   I hope and believe they will look favorably upon our work                                                                        September 2006 Press Releases
