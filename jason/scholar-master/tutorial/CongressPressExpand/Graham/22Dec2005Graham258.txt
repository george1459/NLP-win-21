Defense Authorization bill         The legislation improves benefits for military personnel including a provision offered by U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  to expand TRICARE to all drilling reservists         Graham has worked with other Senators to expand access to health care for members of the National Guard and Reserve who are playing an ever increasing and historic role in the global War on Terror   He noted that Guardsmen and Reservists now make up approximately 40 percent of American forces in Iraq         Our work reflects a significant triumph for the Guard  Reserves and their families     said Graham  chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel     Now  after years of relative neglect  these soldiers   health care coverage and benefits are more in line with their service to our nation   This year  s bill provides continuous health care coverage for all drilling reservists  an important improvement over what we were able to accomplish last year          Under the expansion of TRICARE championed by Graham  all members of the Selected Reserve are eligible to enroll in the military health care program for a monthly premium   The premiums are based on categories of eligibility      Category 1   Members of the Selected Reserve who are called to active duty qualify for TRICARE Reserve Select  TRS    Under this program  established last year  a reservist would accumulate one year of TRS coverage for every 90 days of active duty service   Monthly premiums during the years of accumulated eligibility are only 28 percent of the program cost  The government picks up the remaining 72 percent   As has always been the case  coverage is free of charge while on active duty   This bill now permits accumulation of earned periods of coverage for frequently deployed personnel   In addition  it authorizes 6 months of transitional coverage for family members following the death of the Reserve member  if the member dies while in an inactive status   Category 2   Members of the Selected Reserve who are not called to active duty  and who otherwise do not qualify for health insurance due to unemployment or lack of employer provided coverage  are eligible to enroll in TRICARE for a 50 percent cost sharing premium   The government will pay the remaining 50 percent   Category 3   Members of the Selected Reserve who do not fit into either of the above categories but would like to participate in TRICARE are eligible to do so for an 85 percent cost share   Employers are allowed and encouraged to contribute to the reservist  s share   The government contributes 15 percent of the costs          I will continue to work to improve benefits available to members of the Guard and Reserve     said Graham     The nation will continue to need their services  in large numbers  in fighting the War on Terror   I am proud of and appreciate the progress we  ve made this year with the Senate and Bush Administration working together            Guardsmen and Reservists are citizen soldiers     said Graham     Increasingly they are being called up  taken away from their work and families  and being sent to far away lands for long tours of duty   We need to ensure the benefits they are receiving are equal to the sacrifice they are making to protect our country and interests around the world          The defense bill authorized additional benefits for the men and women serving our nation in uniform   Among these important changes were          A 3 1 percent pay raise for all military personnel          Payment of   matching fund    contributions of up to 5 percent of basic pay for first term enlistees who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan   The TSP is a 401 k  retirement plan available to all federal employees           Increases in maximum amounts of assignment incentive pay and hardship duty pay           60 million increase in child care and family assistance services to active duty and Reserve military families          Critical skills retention bonus of up to  100 000 over a career for members of the Selected Reserve          Increases TRICARE benefits for the surviving children of members who die on active duty          Increases to  100 000 in the death gratuity allowance payable to survivors of all active duty military decedents  including retroactive payment to October 7  2001  the date of commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom          Directs the establishment of a uniform Department policy on casualty assistance to improve the services provided to survivors and next of kin of military members killed on active duty          In addition the bill authorizes increases in the active duty end strength of 10 000 for the Army and 1 000 for the Marine Corps       The bill has been passed by the House and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush in the coming days                                                                 December 2005 Press
