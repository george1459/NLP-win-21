Enforcement Provisions of the Graham Kyl Martinez Amendment  TOUCHBACK Z VISA APPLICANTS MUST LEAVE THE UNITED STATES TO BECOME A Z VISA HOLDER The legislation has been criticized for allowing z visa applicants to stay in the United States indefinitely in z visa status  Others have claimed said z visa holders will never have to leave the United States       The illegal alien head of household  currently residing in the United States    will have to leave our country within 3 years and return to their home country      Once in their home country  they can complete their z visa application       After 3 years  if the illegal alien has not 1  left the United States  2  returned to their home country  3  submitted the appropriate paperwork from their home country  then their probationary status will be revoked  They will be deported along with their spouse and any non American citizen children     VISA OVERSTAYS Approximately 40 percent of the illegal aliens in the United States today did not come across our nations southern border  They came to the United States legally on visas and simply refused to leave the when their visa expired  The Graham Kyl Martinez amendment builds upon a provision already in the bill requiring mandatory jail time of at least 60 days to a maximum of 1 year in jail for aliens who illegally reenter the United States after being deported  Graham Kyl Martinez would    PERMANENTLY bar from the United States any alien who overstays their visa      Aliens who overstay their visa by more than 60 days will be apprehended  detained  and deported      Establishes and deploys a biometric tracking system that records the entry and exit of all temporary workers and visiting family members to ensure we have a record of who overstayed a visa       If the alien refuses to depart in a timely manner  DHS will  within 48 hours  enter the aliens name in a database of overstays accessible for local  state  and immigration law enforcement officials      Authorizes an increase of 6 250 Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel hired to carry out the removal of illegal aliens  to investigate immigration fraud  and to enforce illegal hiring at the workplace      24 HOUR BACKGROUND CHECKS The bill has been criticized for allowing probationary status to be granted to z visa applicants 24 hours after they file an application  even if the alien has not yet passed all appropriate background checks  The Graham Kyl Martinez amendment addresses those concerns    Ensures probationary status will only be granted after passing all appropriate background checks regardless of how long it takes for DHS to complete them       Z visa applicants can pre register online with DHS to speed their application and to make appointments for getting their fingerprints taken      GANG MEMBERS NEED NOT APPLY FOR A Z VISA Critics have said illegal alien gang members will be allowed to receive legal status under the legislation    Graham Kyl Martinez makes it clear that gang members  even those who have renounced their gang membership  are ineligible for the z visa program     CHILD MOLESTORS NEED NOT APPLY FOR A Z VISA Critics have said some child molesters will be allowed to receive legal status under the legislation    Graham Kyl Martinez makes clear that illegal aliens convicted of sexual abuse on a minor are ineligible regardless of when the offense occurred      ADDRESSES VISA OVERSTAYS USING THE PARENT VISA Critics of the legislation have criticized the new parent visa which allows parents of American citizens and the spouses and children of temporary workers to visit a worker in the United States    Graham Kyl Martinez raises the bond for visiting family members from  1 000 to  2 500 to help ensure they depart when their visa is up      Overstay provisions described above apply to the parent visa holders     ILLEGAL ALIEN DRUNK DRIVERS FACE HARSHER STANDARDS   Illegal aliens who have 2 state or federal convictions or 1 felony conviction for drunk driving will not be allowed to gain legal status                                                         June 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
