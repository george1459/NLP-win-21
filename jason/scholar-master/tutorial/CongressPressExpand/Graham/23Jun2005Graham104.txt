                 Date  06 23 2005  Transcript of U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  General John Abizaid  and General George Casey                                                                                                                                 U S  Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                            U S  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM     Just recently here in the Senate we ve had a lot of time absorbed about what one member said that was  I thought  way out of bounds   That member apologized   That was good   There was a time when no one seemed to want to correct that statement        And some of the things that Senator Clinton said are really not helpful        We talk about losing the war and what it would mean   The only way  gentlemen  I see that we could possibly lose in Iraq is to leave the country in shambles  not prepared  not capable of defending itself and taking care of this new democracy  that if we left too soon  before they had a chance to get a functioning army and a functioning police force and to create honest judges and to have the rule of law  that we would put the whole world at risk        So to anyone  Republican or Democrat  who thinks that a timetable is the answer  I could not disagree more        How hard is it to create a country where everybody buys in   It s pretty hard   In 100 and something years  do the math  less than 100 years  we were in a civil war  started in my state          This is hard   How long does it take to get over a 1 400 year religious dispute   Probably a little longer between now and December        We have bought into a model that is extremely difficult  but the only answer  because you can t kill enough of these people   The model is to leave in Iraq the chance for them to govern themselves where moderation trumps terrorism  where mothers have a say about their children  where you can go to court based on what you did  not who you are        That is a very big challenge  and the only answer   So losing is leaving before the job is done          What would make us leave   The last time an American lost on the battlefield was when the Confederacy was defeated   We will not lose a battle   It is not a military problem in terms of losing        We will lose this war if we leave too soon   And what is likely to make us do that   The public going south   And that is happening  And that worries me greatly        So  Mr  Secretary  you ve described the dynamic in 1946 I think very accurately   There was a lot of concern about reconstructing Europe after World War II        I see this engagement in Iraq very similar to a World War II endeavor  not Vietnam   This is not about trying to take sides in a dispute between a country   This is about taking sides between dispute between freedom loving people and terrorists          Whether we should have been there or not is no longer the question   We re there   And the people who want us to leave are the same people who tried to kill us on September 11th        It is a World War II event  but the public views this every day  Mr  Secretary  more and more like Vietnam   Thirty nine percent in the last poll support the idea that we should be there        What do you think is going on  and how can we correct that       SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD     Senator  the members of this committee and everyone in this room and listening know the answer to that question as well as I do  and possibly better        Our system says that we place all our faith  all our hope in the people of the country  and that given sufficient information over time they ll find their way to right decisions   And I believe that        I ve watched polls go from zero to 55 percent  back down to 15 percent in six weeks   And anyone who starts chasing polls is going to get seasick       GRAHAM      Do you believe this is an acute problem or a chronic problem  with the public support waning       RUMSFELD     An acute or a what       GRAHAM      Chronic problem   Because in the last year  sir  the public support in my state has turned  and I worry about that  because that s the only way we ll ever leave before we should  is if the public loses faith in us          And I m here to tell you  sir  in the most patriotic state I can imagine  people are beginning to question   And I don t think it s a blip on the radar screen   I think we have a chronic problem on our hands   And if you disagree  I certainly respect that       RUMSFELD     Well  that s the time that leadership has to stand up and tell the truth   And if you re facing a head wind  you got two choices  you can turn around and go downwind or you can stand there and go into the wind  and that s what needs to be done   And we ve got leadership in this country that are capable of doing that  let there be no doubt          And I think the American people have a good center of gravity   I think they have    individually they have inner gyroscopes that may tilt from time to time  but they get recentered  and that they  given appropriate leadership and given continued success on the political and the security side in that country  I am absolutely convinced that we ll have the willpower and the staying power and the courage to do what s right there        The alternative is to turn that region back to darkness  to people who behead people   And that is not a happy prospect       GRAHAM     I could not agree more        One last thought   I have to go        General Abizaid  based on the military situation as you know it  what is the likelihood of the insurgents and the terrorists combined launching a Tet type offensive where there are coordinated attacks throughout the country that would result in substantial of American or coalition lives   Because if that did happen  I really worry about the response in this country       GRAHAM     How likely is that   And what can we do to prevent it       GENERAL ABIZAID     Senator  I can tell you  and George will undoubtedly talk about this for Iraq in particular  but there is always a likelihood of a surprise militarily   There is always an opportunity for the enemy to figure out a way to inflict casualties  to grab the headlines        The challenge for us is to stay tough enough when that happens to see ourself through it   We can t be defeated by the headlines   We can t be defeated by this enemy   No doubt that they can do us damage        In Afghanistan right now  in particular  we re getting ready to go to an election in September   The enemy is coming as hard as they can   They have issued orders to everybody that they can get their hands on to try to disrupt this election  because they are so afraid of the election        But the violence won t win       JOHN WARNER     Thank you very much  Senator       CASEY     I m sorry  Senator   If I could add to that         WARNER     Yes  General Casey  you may reply       CASEY     Senator  I d just respond to that last question about Tet  I believe we have greatly reduced the potential of the capability for that to happen          And as I ve listened here this afternoon  there seems to be some perception that the attacks have increased   Well  they have from the low levels they sank to after the elections          But last August  the attacks were over 800   Last November    I m sorry  per week    they were over 900   The elections  over 800        We re talking for the last seven weeks they ve been relatively constant at about between 450 and 500   So  I mean  we re less than half  almost half of where we were when it was really hard        So we have brought down that capability  and that s why the absence of a safe haven becomes so important       GRAHAM     Mr  Chairman  I would like to correct the perception that some people may have    I did not disagree with what Senator Clinton said   I am all for us working together  and there are no bad Americans here   You know  whether you re liberal  moderate  conservative  you re not the enemy  the enemy is the people trying to kill us
