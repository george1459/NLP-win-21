                                                                Amendment Sets Guidelines For the Detention of Enemy Combatants and Clarifies that Foreign Terrorists do not have Unlimited Access to US Courts                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON    Today  by a vote of 49 42  the United States Senate expressed support for an plan authored by Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  that strengthens the review process of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  GTMO  while clarifying that non citizen terrorists do not have unlimited access to U S  courts         After the vote Graham made the following statement         I firmly believe that 9 11 was an act of war and not a crime   The detainees at GTMO are not American citizens facing criminal trial  rather   they are terrorists who have taken up arms against the United States         There has never been a time in our military history where an enemy combatant or prisoner of war has been allowed access to federal court to bring lawsuits against the people they are fighting  Habeas corpus rights have never been given to an enemy combatant and the Senate today reaffirmed that principal          Today the Senate voted to allow detainees a one time appeal of their status to a single federal court and  at the same time  stopped the legal abuse  Currently  over 160 cases have been filed by terrorists suing our own troops over every action taken   The due process rights of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay are stronger than Geneva requirements  and with the addition of federal court review  are a model for the world         It is not fair to our troops fighting in the War on Terror to be sued in every court in the land by our enemies based on every possible complaint   We have done nothing today but return to the basics of the law of armed conflict where we are dealing with enemy combatants not common criminals         Graham Amendment   Senator Lindsey Graham  s amendment strengthens the review process of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  GTMO  while clarifying that non citizen terrorists do not have access to U S  courts      The Current Situation at GTMO      The detention status of all detainees at GTMO is assessed by an administrative process called the Combatant Status Review Tribunal  CSRT            CSRT determines the status of a detainee and whether they should be detained at GTMO as an unlawful enemy combatant           The CSRT is composed of three military officers   One officer is a judge advocate  military lawyer  while the senior ranking officer serves as president of the tribunal   Each detainee is assigned a military officer as a personal representative   The officer assists the detainee in preparing for the tribunal hearing            In the tribunal  detainees have the right to testify before the tribunal  call witnesses and introduce evidence            Following a hearing of testimony and introduction of evidence  the tribunal goes into closed door session to determine whether the detainee is properly being termed an enemy combatant   Any detainee determined not to be an enemy combatant is transferred to their home country or handled in a manner consistent with domestic and international obligations and U S  foreign policy           Enemy Combatants detained at GTMO also go before the Administrative Review Board  ARB  for an annual review of their status   The ARB is a three person panel comprised of military officers who determine if the individual is still an enemy combatant  still holds intelligence value or still presents a threat to the United States      What Reforms Are Proposed in the Amendment    The Graham amendment proposes several changes   They include          CSRT may not consider information that was proven by preponderance of the evidence to have been obtained with undue coercion          The Designated Civilian Official  the final authority on the Administrative Review Board  must be confirmed by the Senate   Currently  the Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England          Under the Graham amendment the determination of the CSRT would be subject to review by the D C  Circuit Court of Appeals   This in an historic and unprecedented change       The amendment also contains a provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to change the procedures as long as they give notice to Congress in advance of implementation      The CSRT   ARB Process and the Geneva Conventions      Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 requires a party to an international armed conflict to use a  competent tribunal  to determine the status of a person when there is doubt as to whether the person qualifies as a Prisoner of War           While  by definition  Article 5 does not apply to Al Qaida  because they do not qualify as POW  s and are not part of a state party   the United States established the CSRT and ARB to address the due process concerns expressed by the Supreme Court          The CSRT and ARB procedures  especially with the changes required in this amendment  more than satisfy the requirement for a   competent tribunal    provided for in the Geneva Convention      The Need for Habeas Reform As it Concerns Enemy Combatants      The Supreme Court  s Rasul  2004  decision held that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions from Guantanamo detainees          For the first time foreign terrorists in U S  custody have begun claiming the rights and benefits of the U S  Constitution  our laws  and treaties          Over 160 habeas petitions on behalf of approximately 300 detainees have been filed in federal court to date             An array of habeas challenges have been filed including those questioning the quality of their food and speed of mail delivery   Others have questioned the legality of their detention  propriety of returning a detainee to their home country  and allotment of exercise time   The Department of Justice is devoting tremendous resources to the litigation of habeas petitions filed by GTMO detainees          The federal suits are also slowing our intelligence gathering efforts from detainees   Michael Ratner  a lawyer who has filed lawsuits on behalf of numerous enemy combatants  boasts of this fact   He said    The litigation is brutal for  the United States    It  s huge   We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small firms working to represent these detainees   Every time an attorney goes down there  it makes it much harder  for the U S  military  to do what they  re doing   You can  t run an interrogation    with attorneys   What are they going to do now that we  re getting court orders to get more lawyers down there             The amendment clarifies the previous understanding of the habeas statute that aliens outside the United States do not have access to our federal courts          The amendment only applies to NON CITIZEN TERRORISTS      Examples of Habeas Petitions Filed on Behalf of Detainees      Canadian detainee who threw a grenade that killed an Army medic in firefight and who comes from family with longstanding al Qaeda ties moves for preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation of him or engaging in  cruel  inhuman  or degrading  treatment of him  n b  this motion
