Supports Farm Bill Renewal  WASHINGTON  Last week  the U S  Senate overwhelmingly approved the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007  Farm Bill   U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  the only member from South Carolina who serves on the Agriculture Committee in either the House or the Senate  voted in support of the legislation which passed 79 14  Among the major features  Extends commodity programs for producers   Reauthorizes conservation  agriculture research  rural development  energy  and food assistance programs   Establishes incentives for farmers to invest in the production and conversion of renewable biomass  such as cellulosic ethanol  to energy   Establishes a Rural Collaborative Investment program that would bolster economic development in rural regions by providing grants for projects created by local government  business and nonprofit organizations   Reauthorizes key programs such as the Emergency Food Assistance Program  the Fruit and Vegetable Program  the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  the Wetlands Reserve Program  foreign food assistance programs  and rural programs such as community facility funding  broadband service  rural waste water grants   I know how important these programs are to our states farmers and communities  said Graham  Agriculture is the second largest industry in South Carolina and our rural communities depend on the development funds included in this bill  said Graham  I am pleased we were able to come together and approve a farm bill that maintains current farm programs and includes increased funding for nutrition  specialty crops  conservation and energy programs  I am especially pleased by the provisions relating to energy programs and our farming community  said Graham  This bill takes important strides towards energy independence and the protection of our environment through the authorization of energy programs that build on the potential of cellulose based ethanol as an alternative energy source  Graham worked to include additional grant programs that could benefit research and training being conducted in South Carolina  These include expanding research conducted on forage fed beef systems and a New Era Rural Technology Program that would provide grant money to community colleges for training an agriculture workforce in bio energy  and the pulp and paper industry  The legislation also includes a Graham backed provision that would provide economic adjustment assistance in the amount of 4 cents per pound to textile manufacturers for the modernization of equipment and operations  Graham noted there are several reform provisions in the bill such as a reduction in payment limits over the life of the bill that would prohibit payments to producers whose adjusted gross income exceeds  750 000 and who earn less than two thirds of their income from farming  Under current law  payments are prohibited to producers with incomes above  2 5 million and who make less than three fourths of their income from farming  The Senate bill would also ban some farmers from collecting payments for multiple farm businesses  This farm bill is not perfect and everyone would admit that there are some things in this bill that they dont like  said Graham  However  I am proud that through much negotiation an acceptable middle ground was reached  As a matter of national security  we must support programs that will ensure a reliable and constant food supply for all Americans  In addition to broad support in the Senate  the legislation is also backed by various farming groups including the American Farm Bureau  South Carolina Farm Bureau  the South Carolina Department of Agriculture  the National Cotton Council  the South Carolina Cotton Farmers  the Southern Peanut Farmers Federation  and the American Soybean Association  Farmers are in the midst of planning for the new crop year and are at a distinct disadvantage in not knowing how farm programs will be structured for the coming year  said Hugh Weathers  South Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture  We appreciate Senator Graham s efforts in securing passage of the Senate Bill and look forward to following the process of negotiating a Farm Bill that will provide the security farmers need as they begin planning their intentions for 2008  The bill will now go to conference committee with the House of Representatives                                                           December 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
