SENATORS  BILL PUTS NEW TOOLS  TEETH IN CURRENCY POLICY  Graham  Baucus  Grassley  and Schumer unveil long awaited legislation addressing misaligned foreign currencies  competitive threats to U S  businesses and workers    WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  along with Senators Max Baucus  D Montana   Chuck Grassley  R Iowa   and Charles Schumer  D New York  today introduced major legislation to deal with foreign currency concerns threatening the U S  economy   The Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2007 establishes a new approach to examining world currencies  requiring new consultations with offending nations and imposing new consequences for inaction  When currencies are so undervalued that they become fundamentally misaligned with the U S  dollar  they can put American manufacturers and wage earners at a significant disadvantage in the global economy  The bill unveiled today is the result of the four Senators 2006 commitment to draft new  vigorous  and WTO consistent legislation to address currency misalignments   This is a wake up call  said Graham  No longer will the United States sit on the sidelines and allow other nations to gain an unfair advantage by manipulating their currency  Our legislation is a much needed and long overdue change  There is no doubt that China and other nations have been manipulating their currency to give themselves an advantage  For too long the game has been rigged against American business  Working together we will change currency practices to put American business on a level playing field   This bill requires the Treasury Department to take firm but fair action when other nations play games with the U S  dollar  For too long  our currency policy has left American workers and businesses unprotected from foreign governments seeking an unfair financial advantage  said Baucus  Weve worked together to craft a measured but meaningful framework for dealing with currency concerns  This is a reasonable response to the problems caused when currencies are significantly out of sync  Treasury should welcome the opportunity this bill offers to give America a strong and even hand in currency matters   The United States respects the rule of law  We expect our trading partners to do the same  said Grassley  Unlike some other approaches to currency manipulation  this bill is WTO compliant  It sets consequences for countries that want to access the U S  market but dont play fair  Were not picking a fight with anyone  Today  the problem country is China  Tomorrow  it may be Country X  This enforcement structure could apply to any trading partner with out of whack currency  It gives a good chance for self correction before penalties ramp up  Its a velvet glove with a steel fist inside   This breakthrough proposal is like nothing else because its tough  wide reaching and WTO compliant  said Schumer  The previous legislation got Chinas attention  the purpose of this legislation is to force change  Drafting legislation that was both tough and WTO compliant was no easy task but we worked and worked for what appears to be the most elegant solution to the China conundrum so far   The Senators bill eliminates the current U S  Treasury Department framework for addressing currency concerns  which requires Treasury to label countries currency manipulators before taking action and then only requires negotiation with the offending country  The potential political consequences of the manipulator label have kept Treasury from applying it as needed to protect U S  economic concerns   The consensus proposal unveiled today instead requires the U S  Treasury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies to Congress twice a year  marking some currencies for priority action if the misalignment is clearly caused by a foreign governments economic policies  Treasury will be required to consult with any country with fundamentally misaligned currency  but a designation for priority action has further immediate consequences  The Treasury Department will be required to oppose changes in International Monetary Fund  IMF  rules benefiting that nation  and currency concerns will be taken into account if countries with non market economies wish to receive market status   If a designated country fails to take appropriate action within six months  additional steps must be taken  When the U S  works to determine whether a country is unfairly dumping goods into the American market  it must be taken into account that the undervalued currency makes imported goods from the designated country artificially cheap  Further steps include suspension of U S  government procurement  requests for special consultation by the IMF  and suspension of loans and private insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to U S  companies wishing to operate in that nation  If issues are not resolved within one year  the legislation requires the U S  Trade Representative to commence WTO dispute settlement proceedings regarding the currency problem  and requires the Treasury Secretary to consider possible remedial intervention by the Federal Reserve Board and other central banks   At the six month and twelve month marks  the President of the United States may waive the bills requirements if implementing them poses a threat to national security or Americas economic interests  But the bill also increases congressional input by giving Congress the ability to voice disapproval of the Presidential economic waiver  and by creating a new body  appointed by the President and the leaders of committees of jurisdiction  with which Treasury must consult during the development of its report   Baucus and Grassley are Chairman and Ranking Republican and Schumer is a member of the Senate Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over U S  trade policy  The Senators bill is expected to be referred to the Finance Committee
