                 Date  02 09 2005  Bipartisan Group of Senators and Congressmen Join Graham to Introduce National Guard and Reserve Benefits Legislation                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today was joined with by a bipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen to introduce The Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005           The legislation improves healthcare benefits for members of the National Guard and Reserves by allowing them to enroll in TRICARE for a monthly premium regardless of their activation status   TRICARE is the military healthcare system          In addition  the legislation provides for a decrease in retirement age based on years of service   Under current law  the retirement age is 60   Under the proposal  if an individual serves for 22 years  they are eligible for retirement at 59   An individual entering military service at 18 and serving for 34 years could begin receiving his or her retirement benefits at 53          This reform package provides better health coverage and a fair retirement system that promotes retention     said Graham  who serves as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and is a Colonel in the U S  Air Force Reserves     It will ensure that Guard and Reserve personnel and their families are justly compensated for their service   The increased demands placed on the men and women who serve this country in a part time capacity require a modernization of their benefits   We must be sure to take care of every person who puts their life on the line to fight for liberty and freedom throughout the world               Guardsmen and Reservists are citizen soldiers     said Graham     Increasingly they are being called up  taken away from their work and families  and being sent to far away lands for long tours of duty   We need to ensure the benefits they are receiving are equal to the sacrifice they are making to protect our country and interests around the world             Now is the time to act     said Graham     There is momentum in Congress for improving Guard and Reserve benefits  and we need to continue to build on the progress we made last year   The ultimate goal is to provide these men and women with the option to enroll in TRICARE full time           In October 2004  Graham worked with a bipartisan group of legislators to push into law additional health care benefits for members of the Guard and Reserve   Under that provision  Guardsmen and Reservists who serve on active duty under federal orders for 90 consecutive days will be eligible for one year of TRICARE coverage         For every additional 90 days of service they will be eligible for an additional year of health care coverage   The Department of Defense will pay 72 percent of the cost and the reservist will be responsible for paying the remaining 28 percent        Also included was a provision allowing Guardsmen and Reservists to become eligible for TRICARE upon receiving their activation orders and the ability to remain on the healthcare system for 180 days after they are deactivated   The provision applies to all members of the Guard and Reserve regardless of the length of time activated          We  re going to continue pushing for better health care benefits for our citizen soldiers     said Graham     The National Guard and Reserves have been called upon more often to help protect this country and defend American interests     said Graham     They are playing a vital role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and are an integral part of the war on terrorism   They need to be rewarded and justly compensated for their service to our nation                      Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005    This bipartisan legislation would promote recruitment  readiness  and retention by offering TRICARE eligibility to members of the Guard and Reserve for a modest monthly premium and by reducing the age at which a Reservist can receive retirement benefits based on his or her years of service       BILL PROVISIONS    RETIREMENT   Currently  Reservists and Guardsmen receive retirement benefits at age 60   With this legislation  however  for every two years of service over twenty  a Guardsman or Reservist would receive benefits one year earlier   For example  after 22 years of service  a member of the Reserve Component would receive benefits at age 59  after 24 years  age 58  and so on   This would promote retention at our most experienced levels of service       HEALTHCARE   Building on last year  s progress in the Ronald W  Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005  this legislation would offer full time TRICARE eligibility to members of the Reserve Component for a monthly premium        OUR SECURITY RELIES INCREASINGLY ON A STRONG RESERVE FORCE    The Reserves have played an integral role in every military operation since Desert Shield Desert Storm   Their overall activity level  measured by annual duty days  has risen from about 1 million in the late 1980s to more than 12 million in every year since 1996   For example  the Reserves have taken charge of the entire peacekeeping mission in the Balkans   In Iraq  Guard and Reserve troops have rotated with active duty forces  increasing their share of the total U S  force to about 40 percent       DISPARITY BETWEEN RESERVISTS AND OTHER   PART TIME    FEDERAL EMPLOYEES   New part time federal employees hired into permanent positions may join the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan  FEHBP  at the start of their employment by paying a higher premium   In addition  a part time federal employee must work a minimum of 16 hours per week to be eligible for healthcare while Reservists  who receive only conditional healthcare until activated  are required to work one weekend per month  two weeks per year  AND be prepared to deploy  We are asking that this disparity be corrected by offering Reservists the same options as other   part time    federal employees        THE RESERVES FACE A RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CRISIS     This is the first extended duration war our nation has fought with an all volunteer force     said  Lt  General James R   Helmly     We must be sensitive to that   And we must apply proactive  preventive measures to prevent a recruiting retention crisis       Wash  Post  01 21 04         The Army National Guard is 15 000 soldiers below its normal strength and is hoping to make up the difference by September  Last month  the Guard met 56  of its monthly recruiting goal      Los Angeles Times  02 03 05         Given this implementation  DOD  s current mobilization scheme   DOD could eventually run out of forces      General Accounting Office  GAO 05 285T  released 2005        National Guard and Reserve Issues in the News   Houston Chronicle   January 2  2005        With reservists accounting for 40 percent of the U S  force in Iraq   a percentage expected to slightly increase this year   the National Guard is struggling  It fell about 7 000 soldiers short in 2003 of the 56 000 soldiers needed to maintain a 350 000 soldier force  Last year  the Guard was 10 000 soldiers short and facing an even bigger recruiting goal  63 000 this year           Los Angeles Times   January 6  2005        Given the demands that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed on men and women who had planned on being part time soldiers  the Army Reserve is  in grave danger of being unable to meet other operational requirements  and is  rapidly degenerating into a  broken  force    Lt  Gen  James R   Helmly wrote   I do not wish to sound alarmist  I do wish to send a clear  distinctive signal of deepening concern   Helmly said           Washington Post   February 3  2005        Massing enough troops for another rotation in Iraq will be   painful   and may eventually require the Pentagon to adopt policies that would extend the two year limit on the mobilization of reserves  a senior Army leader told Congress yesterday   Right now we have 650 000 soldiers on active duty executing missions worldwide  and many of them have met their 24 month cumulative time  so we ll have to address this   Gen  Richard A  Cody testified before the House Armed Services Committee   Yesterday s testimony underscored a debate brewing in the Pentagon over how to meet the long term demands of the war on terrorism  The Pentagon now limits reserves to a total of 24 months of active duty  but the Army is considering seeking an extension to allow for longer and more frequent deployments of reservists           Army Times   January 17  2005        The Army Reserve has about 200 000 soldiers  and since Sept  11  2001  has deployed 65 000 in the global war on terrorism  mainly in Iraq  where it accounts for about 40 percent of all U S  forces   Meanwhile  a published report said Army leaders want the authority to order some Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers to serve longer and more frequent deployments  The proposed policy would be contingent on making permanent what is supposed to be a temporary increase of 30 000 troops to the active component                                                            February 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
