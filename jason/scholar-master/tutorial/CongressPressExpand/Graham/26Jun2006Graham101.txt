Pushes Health Care  Retirement and Chain of Command Changes in Senate Defense Bill                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today announced the Senate has approved an amendment that will revamp the retirement system and further improve access to the military healthcare system  TRICARE  for Reservists and Guardsmen     The amendment was offered by Graham  along with Senators Saxby Chambliss  R Georgia  and Hillary Clinton  D New York   to the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization Bill   The bill passed 96 0          Guardsmen and Reservists are citizen soldiers     said Graham    Increasingly they are being called up  taken away from their work and families  and being sent to far away lands for long tours of duty  We need to ensure the benefits they are receiving are equal to the sacrifice they are making to protect our country and interests around the world           Graham has taken the lead role in championing expanded TRICARE access in the Senate   This latest amendment builds on the success Graham had last year when Congress overhauled the TRICARE system  greatly expanding access for members of the Selected Reserve        Under the expansion passed last year  all members of the Selected Reserve are eligible to enroll in the military health care program for a monthly premium based on their service and employment status        The amendment passed by the Senate last week improves this system by reducing the co payment for those who have not been deployed  are eligible for other private insurance  but want continuous access to TRICARE   It reduces the cost share for the Reservist from 85  to 75  with the government paying the remainder   Employees of small businesses would become eligible for a 50 50 cost share under Tier 2   In addition  to provide further savings to Reservists  Senator Graham introduced a separate bill allowing members to pay their TRICARE premiums on a pre tax basis like all other federal employees          I will continue to work to improve benefits available to members of the Guard and Reserve     said Graham    The nation will continue to need their services in fighting the War on Terror           Another significant provision included in the amendment would lower the retirement age for members of the United States National Guard and Reserve based on the number of days the member is called to active duty   The retirement age requirement would be reduced by 3 months for every 90 days of continuous active service a Reservist performs in support of a contingency operation or in a war zone   The minimum age to collect retirement pay is set at 50   This provision is retroactive to September 2001          Reservists and Guardsmen have been deployed at historic rates     said Graham     Rewarding them by allowing them to retire earlier than the current system allows is a tremendous incentive for retention   The incentive for early retirement combined with more affordable health care will dramatically improve the quality of life for our Reserve community and their families   I am proud these two provisions have received unanimous  bipartisan support           Graham noted that the Senate also approved an amendment he authored to give military commanders a more fair and efficient means of discipline on the battlefield   The provision clarifies the Uniform Code of Military Justice to place civilian contractors accompanying the Armed Forces in the field under court martial jurisdiction during contingency operations as well as in times of declared war        The Defense Authorization Bill approves more than  517 billion in budget authority for national security and defense programs at the U S  Departments of Defense and Energy   The bill includes more than  50 billion in funding for ongoing operations in the War on Terror        The bill will now go to conference with the House of Representatives                  TRICARE System Under Current Law   Tier 1  Members of the Selected Reserve who are called to active duty qualify for TRICARE Reserve Select  TRS   Under this program a Reservist who agrees to stay in the Service accumulates one year of TRS coverage for every 90 days of active duty service  Monthly premiums during the years of accumulated eligibility are only 28 percent of the program cost  The government picks up the remaining 72 percent  As has always been the case  coverage is free of charge while on active duty  The system permits accumulation of earned periods of coverage for frequently deployed personnel  In addition  Reservist  s family members receive 6 months of transitional coverage following the death of the Reserve member  if the member dies while in an inactive status        Tier 2  Members of the Selected Reserve who are not called to active duty  and who otherwise do not qualify for health insurance due to unemployment or lack of employer provided coverage  are eligible to enroll in TRICARE for a 50 percent cost sharing premium  The government will pay the remaining 50 percent        Tier 3  Members of the Selected Reserve who do not fit into either of the above categories  have not been deployed and have access to other private health insurance  but would like to participate continuously in TRICARE are eligible to do so for an 85 percent cost share  Employers are allowed and encouraged to contribute to the reservist  s share  The government contributes 15 percent of the cost                                                         June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
