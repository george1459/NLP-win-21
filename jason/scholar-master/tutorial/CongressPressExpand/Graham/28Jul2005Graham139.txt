 R S C   joined U S  Senators Lindsey Graham  R S C  and Jim DeMint  R S C   in announcing over  125 million in the House Senate highway conference report to fund road projects in the First Congressional District of South Carolina   The surface transportation bill provides  286 4 billion in federal highway contract authority between 2004 and 2009  and is expected to pass the Senate and the House later this week   President Bush is expected to sign the legislation soon after         As we complete the highway authorization bill  I feel that we have crafted legislation that both enhances the Nation s highway infrastructure and also significantly benefits the First District   said Congressman Henry Brown   Jim and Lindsey helped form a powerful team in the Senate  and I am deeply appreciative of their assistance and of their leadership   Not only have we been able to secure a higher rate of return at 92  by 2008  but we have guaranteed that South Carolina s most critical highway project  I 73  has every opportunity to be accomplished   I 73 will provide much needed congestion relief and economic development that will allow the Grand Strand region to continue its strong growth   I would also like to thank John Spratt for his contribution of  8 million to I 73           The highway bill is very good news for motorists in South Carolina     said Senator Graham     As a state  we were able to secure a more equitable funding formula which will put additional dollars toward our road system   It truly moves the ball forward in our efforts to build new roads while maintaining and improving the ones we currently have   I truly appreciate the work done by Jim and Henry on the highway bill   They  ve been leaders in this area and we all owe them a debt of gratitude for what they  ve been able to accomplish   Making sure our state was treated in a fair and equitable manner was a team effort  but these two guys served as team captains and deserve a great deal of credit for what our state was able to accomplish             The funding for these projects will improve our infrastructure and make South Carolina more competitive while also improving safety and our quality of life     said Senator DeMint     It was great to work with Henry on the conference committee   He worked tirelessly to make sure our priorities were addressed  and his efforts should be applauded   We are especially excited about I 73  and we will continue to work for its completion  I also want to personally thank Lindsey for his leadership and help to ensure South Carolina was treated fairly throughout this process            Overall  the Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  TEA LU  will authorize  2 9 billion to South Carolina  s highway  highway safety and transit programs   This is a total increase of nearly 28 percent over TEA 21   In addition to formula monies  several specific projects in the First District will receive significant funding  as described in the attached list   Most notable of these items is I 73  which has been earmarked  81 million   I 73 is also designated as a Project of Regional and National Significance
