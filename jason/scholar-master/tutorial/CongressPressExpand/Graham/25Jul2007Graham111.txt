Offers Amendment on Border Security and Interior Enforcement to Homeland Security Legislation   WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today offered an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security funding legislation appropriating  3 billion for increased border security efforts      There are at least half a dozen major changes in policy we have to make as a nation to get the problems of illegal immigration under control  said Graham  The comprehensive approach  where we made all the necessary changes in one fell swoop  failed  Just because it failed does not mean the problems posed by illegal immigration have gone away     Were now moving to Plan B  said Graham  That will require us to address the major changes that must be made a piece at a time  Today  were addressing border security  visa overstays  sanctuary cities  and other important issues  Theres no doubt that operational control of our southern border is a national security imperative  We must regain control of our border and this much need emergency funding will play an important role in making that happen   Graham noted Congressman Rahm Emanuel  a leading member of the Democratic House leadership  recently said comprehensive immigration reform will have to wait at least six years until the second term of a prospective Democratic presidency     Unlike Congressman Emanuel  I do not believe we can wait years to address our nations pressing and urgent immigration problems  said Graham  My amendment contains many of the provisions that were in the Senate immigration bill and Graham Kyl Martinez  These are the provisions of immigration reform where there is broad consensus  They should be enacted      The Graham Amendment is cosponsored by Senators Judd Gregg  R New Hampshire   John Cornyn  R TX   Jon Kyl  R AZ   Jeff Sessions  R AL   John McCain  R AZ   Mitch McConnell  R KY   Mel Martinez  R FL   Arlen Specter  R PA   and John Sununu  R NH      The major provisions include additional funding and policy changes affecting our nations border security and interior enforcement efforts     Border Security         The  U S   government must achieve full operational control over 100 percent of the U S  Mexico land border        The hiring  training and deploying of 23 000 Border Patrol agents        4 unmanned aerial vehicles and 105 ground based radar and camera towers        300 miles of permanent vehicle barriers and 700 miles of border fencing        45 000 detention beds to put a permanent end to Catch and Release       Interior Enforcement         Requires a total of 14 500 new Customs  Border Patrol  CBP  agents through Fiscal Year 2012  a total of approximately 30 000 CBP agents overall  as well as increased hires of new Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  agents        Addresses the issue of Sanctuary Cities by prohibiting cities from banning the obtaining of information on immigration status by their own law enforcement agencies        Builds upon the King Amendment in the House of Representatives  which grants civil liability protection to those who report possible threats to our nations transportation system        Provides additional funding for Operation Jump Start which maintains a National Guard presence along the Southern border        Strengthens current law on criminal aliens to deny immigration benefits to aggravated felons  gang members  terrorists  sex offenders  and child abusers  The bill also expands the Institutional Removal Program and gives the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  the ability to detain criminal aliens for an extended period of time before they can be removed        Gives states and local law enforcement new authorities to detain illegal aliens and transfer them into DHS custody  It also allows state and local law enforcement authorities to use homeland security grants for 287 g  training and provides funding to cover the costs of detaining and transporting criminal aliens        Addresses Visa Overstays by requiring DHS to detain aliens who willfully overstay their period of authorized admission for more than 60 days        Addresses illegal reentry by increasing criminal penalties and sets mandatory minimum prison sentences for aliens who have been removed and illegally re enter our country        Provides for Expedited Removal by restricting the impact of outdated court injunctions that currently prevent DHS from transferring certain illegal immigrants into expedited removal and returning them to their country of origin as soon as circumstances allow        Addresses US Visit and Entry Inspecting by clarifying DHSs authority to collect biometric entry and exit data at      U S       ports of entry  It also requires DHS to provide Congress a timeline for implementing US VISIT at all land border ports of entry        Requires DHS to enhance Basic Pilot Program to help facilitate broader us by employers as well as improve accuracy and efficiency       What we do today in my amendment is an important step  but certainly not the only step  to get a handle on illegal immigration  said Graham  As a nation  we still need a more robust electronic employee verification system  EEVS   a merit based immigration system  assimilation programs to ensure people understand English  a method to ensure everyone is paying taxes  a temporary guest worker program for people who want to come here  make money and return to their home country  and other changes     We are serious about border security and this again shows the commitment to do whatever is necessary to regain control of our borders  said Graham  The sooner we get a handle on the problems associated with illegal immigration  the better off our nation will be      This amendment is a step in the right direction and the beginning of what I expect will be a longer  more drawn out effort to reform our nations immigration practices  concluded Graham
