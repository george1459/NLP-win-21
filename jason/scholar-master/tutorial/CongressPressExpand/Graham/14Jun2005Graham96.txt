Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today launched the bipartisan Senate Manufacturing Caucus to spearhead Congressional efforts to address problems facing our country  s manufacturing industry         The United States has seen a significant erosion of its manufacturing base with over three million manufacturing jobs lost over the past seven years   Today  14 3 million Americans are employed in the manufacturing sector  the lowest level of manufacturing employment since the end of World War II   Manufacturing job losses have hit virtually every state in the country          For generations  our manufacturing sector has been the backbone of the American economy   Manufacturing jobs built our great Middle Class and allowed millions of families to live the American Dream and create a better life for their children   That bedrock strength is being eroded and we cannot afford as a country to sit back while our manufacturing capability slips away     said Senator Clinton     We need a strong manufacturing base for our economy to grow and we need to invest in creating the manufacturing jobs of the future   This caucus will lead efforts on Capitol Hill to help address these challenges               South Carolina  s economy is heavily based on manufacturing and over the last decade this sector has taken one hit after another     said Senator Graham     We can no longer watch good jobs disappear   It  s now time for Republicans and Democrats to join together to protect American manufacturing jobs and take steps to create a better business environment   The caucus will explore all aspects of the manufacturing sector with the ultimate goal of restoring this vital part of our economy   To improve the manufacturing climate in our state and nation  we  ll have to work together   The creation of the Manufacturing Caucus is another step in the right direction           The caucus will identify strategies to address the root causes of the problems facing American manufacturing and opportunities for Congressional action to create and keep manufacturing jobs   They also noted the need to address the costs of health care and pensions that threaten American companies and their workers        Manufacturing leads every other sector of our economy in productivity growth  leading to higher wages  higher profits and lower prices   The average manufacturing job pays about  5 per hour more than jobs in the service sector and manufacturing jobs have a multiplier effect    for every manufacturing job created in the United States  there are four jobs created that depend on that manufacturing job          In particular  Senators Graham and Clinton noted the urgency to continue to invest in research and development to foster innovation needed to keep our manufacturers competitive   Manufacturers currently lead the way in R  spearheading almost two thirds of all private sector R  The innovations resulting from this R benefit not only the manufacturing sector  but also non manufacturing sectors of the economy          Senators Graham and Clinton emphasized we cannot remain confident in our economic or national security if we become a country dependent on our other nations to provide our goods   In order to sustain a healthy and competitive manufacturing base  we need to maintain innovation and productivity           The caucus will bring together business and labor leaders  economists  and other stakeholders  commission academic studies and other inquiries and champion legislation to address challenges facing our country  s manufacturing sector          Clinton and Graham will serve as Co Chairs of the caucus   Charter members of the caucus include Senators Evan Bayh  D IN   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Tom Coburn  R OK
