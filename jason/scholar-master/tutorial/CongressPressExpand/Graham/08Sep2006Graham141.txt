                       WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  made the following statement on testimony before the House Armed Services Committee made by generals and admirals from the United States Army  Navy  Air Force  and Marine Corps   The military leaders were testifying about the structure and procedure of tribunals to try terror suspects         The concerns expressed by the generals and admirals about how we should conduct the trials of terrorists are very serious   I hope Members of Congress will agree                    Statements from Military Leaders before the House Armed Services Committee  September 7  2006     Brigadier General James C  Walker  U S  Marine Corps  Staff Judge Advocate           I am not aware of any situation in the world where there is a system of jurisprudence that is recognized by civilized people where an individual can be tried and convicted without seeing the evidence against him   And I don t think that the United States needs to become the first in that scenario                      I personally remain concerned about any process which would permit the introduction of evidence against an accused outside of his presence   I simply believe the right to see the evidence against you and to be present when evidence is presented are fundamental to a full and fair trial and are also part of those judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people                            I concur with my colleagues that if we get to a point where the sole evidence against an accused is classified  he must be able to see that evidence   That s just essentially one of those elements of a full and fair trial                      We must maintain our nation s ability to deal with terrorists and with unlawful enemy combatants  but at the same time we must also provide those judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people                      While we seek that balance  we also must remember the concept of reciprocity   What we do and how we treat these individuals can  in the future  have a direct impact on our service men and women overseas          Major General Scott Black  United States Army  Judge Advocate General           I can t imagine any military judge believing that an accused has had a full and fair hearing if all the government s evidence that was introduced was all classified and the accused was not able to see any of it                      The Hamdan decision has reinforced our need to ensure military commissions are reflective of American values such as due process and the rule of law                      Our task has been to balance the utility of the military commissions with these values that are foundational to our democratic society                      I am concerned  one  that the package does not contain a provision that would prohibit the admission of evidence outside of the presence of the accused when that evidence is the sole evidence admitted to establish a material fact  if you follow   If it s the only piece of evidence that s necessary to convict  then I remain concerned about excluding the accused              Major General Charles Dunlap  United States Air Force  Deputy Judge Advocate General            A process fully compliant with Common Article 3 will enhance our standing internationally and empower our allies to embrace the legal reasoning and architecture behind the prosecution of military commission cases   Doing so is plainly in our war fighting interest                      But my bottom line  my personal opinion  sir  is that we cannot have a process whereby the finder of fact    not the judge deciding  but the finder of fact    gets evidence that the accused never sees and never has the opportunity to defend against                 Rear Admiral Bruce MacDonald  United State Navy  Judge Advocate General                there are some issues  particularly the use of classified evidence  where I would stand by the approach to that taken by the Uniform Code of Military Justice                      With respect to coerced statements  it would be my position that I would recommend that the committee look at not allowing coerced statements  that statements that are obtained under torture are excluded under the current commission rules   However  statements obtained through coercion  if they meet a reliability and probative test  are admitted                     I would recommend that the committee look to the Detainee Treatment Act and the cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment standard and apply that standard as well to statements that may or may not be coerced   And I would leave that determination to the military judge in charge of the commission to balance those competing interests                                                          September 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
