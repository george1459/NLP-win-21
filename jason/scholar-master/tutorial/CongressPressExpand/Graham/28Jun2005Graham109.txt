                 Date  06 28 2005  GEORGIA SOUTH CAROLINA LAWMAKERS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR SAVANNAH RIVER ECOLOGY LABORATORY                                                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON    Today  Georgia and South Carolina lawmakers praised the Department of Energy  DOE  for agreeing to provide  4 3 million for the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in Aiken  SC in fiscal year 2006   The announcement is part of a joint year long effort to secure funding for the laboratory          Senators Saxby Chambliss  R Ga   Johnny Isaskon  R Ga   Lindsey Graham  R SC and Jim DeMint  R SC  along with Reps  Jack Kingston  R Ga   Charlie Norwood  R Ga   and Gresham Barrett  R SC  launched the effort earlier this year upon learning the White House budget did not include funds for the laboratory   The lawmakers credit U S  Department of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman for listening to their concerns and working with the Georgia and South Carolina delegation to invest funding in the laboratory  s critical work           In numerous meetings  phone calls and letters we jointly impressed upon Secretary Bodman the importance of this project to our nation     said Chambliss     The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory has been operated by the University of Georgia for over 54 years and has been widely recognized for its research  education and pubic outreach programs  I am thankful Secretary Bodman and his staff worked with us to address the laboratory  s important funding needs             I am very pleased Secretary Bodman has been so willing to work with us over the past several months to ensure that the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the University of Georgia can continue their critical research at Savannah River Site  Our Georgia and South Carolina delegations made a very strong case as to why SREL deserves to continue to receive funding from the Department of Energy and we appreciate Secretary Bodman  s willingness to take this action     Isakson said          The SREL has helped track the effects on the environment from our Cold War missions     said Graham     The data they collect provides a public health service and the funding level we achieved in the Senate is an important step toward the lab  s continued operation   I  m pleased we were able to work with our friends from Georgia to secure funding this year             I  m glad the Department of Energy worked with us to find a thoughtful solution to address the needs of the lab     said Senator DeMint     The Savannah River Ecology Lab  s independent analysis is crucial to understanding the environmental impact of work done at the Savannah River site   This decision will sustain the lab and its important work                 This is good news   Congressman Kingston said   Keeping funding flowing for the ecological research being done at the lab is very important  I know Dr  Bertsch is pleased and I am glad Secretary Bodman and the Energy Department worked with us to keep this going           We have worked hard to impress upon the Department of Energy the importance of SREL s mission to the nation   While I am disappointed that full funding was not restored through the contract year  I am pleased that Secretary Bodman worked with us to provide enough funding for SREL to remain operational   said Barrett    We remain committed to working together for the future of the lab          While it remains a disappointment that we were unable to convince DOE to restore full funding  we have still come away with a clear victory for maintaining SREL until new  permanent funding sources can be found   says Norwood    The work done by SREL is too vital for the nation s environmental research efforts to ever let this facility go dark           Situated on the grounds of Savannah River Site  SRS   the SREL provides an independent evaluation of the ecological effects of DOE s SRS operations through a program of ecological research  education  and outreach which involves basic and applied environmental research  with emphasis upon expanding the understanding of ecological processes and principles  and upon evaluating the impacts of industrial and land use activities on the environment
