Statement on Army Field Manual and Military Tribunals                                                                                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today made the following statement on release of the new Army Field Manual and President Bush  s proposal for military tribunals       On Army Field Manual       I  m extremely pleased with the Army Field Manual   In my opinion it is a model for the international community when it comes to detaining and interrogating unlawful enemy combatants   It  s clear the Bush Administration listened to and responded to the input from the Congress  military officials and legal scholars   The revised Army Field Manual exceeded my expectations   I appreciate and applaud the Administration for their work on this issue          On Military Tribunals       The next challenge we face is the establishment of military commissions to try terror suspects   We need to ensure the commissions can withstand judicial scrutiny  hold terrorists accountable for their actions  and make the American people proud of our justice system            It is imperative Congress and the President work together to authorize military commissions and allow trials to move forward   I hope we can complete this by the end of September as it is in our national interest to conduct these trials without further delay   It is also important the military commissions comply with the Supreme Court  s Hamdan decision and be modeled  where applicable  after the military court martial system   There will need to be some modifications made as the needs of the commission are different from a court martial          I believe what differences we may have between the current Bush Administration proposal and the Senate Armed Services Committee draft proposal can be overcome and that agreement will soon be reached   I look forward to being part of that process and am pleased with the working relationship I have formed with the Administration on this issue             I do not think we can afford to again cut legal corners that will result in federal court rejection of our work product   I  m hopeful that spirit will prevail among all the parties   If we approach commissions with the same attitude we had on the Army Field Manual  we will have a successful outcome           One area of contention we must address is how classified information can be used in a military commission            I strongly support the government  s ability to withhold classified information vital to our national security from accused terrorists   The military justice system already has legal procedures in place dealing with the admissibility of classified information   Military lawyers have experience in protecting classified information and our national security   We can and should use their advice and experience on how to deal with classified information in creating the commission system   The Senate proposal contains important national security safeguards to protect classified information and relies on the advice and counsel of JAGs from the Army  Navy  Air Force and Marines          I believe it would be a mistake to allow the jury to see classified evidence the accused never sees   After many consultations with military legal officers  JAGs  in the Army  Navy  Air Force and Marines  I do not believe it is necessary to have a trial where the accused cannot see the evidence against them   I fear that creating such a procedure would not be well received by the courts   The military legal officers  JAGs  serving in uniform have also expressed concern that this could establish a precedent that could be used against our own troops   I share this concern                                                                        September 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
