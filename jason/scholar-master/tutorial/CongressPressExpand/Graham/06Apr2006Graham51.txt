                       WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina  today said he supported the Senate compromise bill on immigration reform   Graham participated in the negotiations with other Senators which led to the agreement   President Bush has expressed support for the bipartisan work of the Senate        Under the agreement  illegal immigrants would be separated into categories depending on the length of time they have been in the United States             Illegal immigrants living in the country at least five years would be put on an eleven year path toward citizenship as long as they paid a  2 000 fine  passed a national security and criminal background check  remained employed  paid federal and state taxes  registered for military service  passed a civics test  and learned to speak English   They will not have to visit a port of entry                Illegal immigrants living in the country for two to five years would have the opportunity obtain a temporary work visa   They would be subject to the visa requirements  fines  background checks  taxes paid  etc    but they must exit the country   These immigrants would be fingerprinted and processed through US VISIT at a land port of entry for return into the United States   After no less than eleven years  they could become citizens               Illegal immigrants who have been in the country less than two years would be required to leave the United States   They could apply for temporary worker status  but would not be guaranteed to receive this status             For illegal immigrants in the United States more than two years  the Senate bill is similar to a plea bargain     said Graham     They will have to come out of the shadows and acknowledge they came to the United States in violation of our immigration laws   The terms of probation will be to pay  2 000 in fines  undergo two national security and criminal background checks  remain employed  pay all federal and state taxes  register for military service  show proficiency in the English language and understand American civics             I think the terms of the probation are strict but fair     said Graham     Some immigrants will meet the terms of their probation and some won  t   Those who don  t will face deportation   Those who do will then be able to go to the back of the line to apply for citizenship   We made the conditions strict to ensure people pay their debt to society and they do the right thing if they wish to live in the United States             The legislation retains the language on border enforcement and worker verification which Graham acknowledged were major provisions to enforce any immigration reform effort        Graham noted that one new provision was particularly important   It says that employers cannot offer a job to a guest worker until they verify the position was publicly listed at the prevailing wage and no American wanted to fill the position   This will help address concerns that guest workers will take jobs from Americans or depress wages in an area          I  m pleased the Senate has chosen to come together  along with President Bush  to provide a comprehensive solution to the immigration problems facing our nation     said Graham     This problem has been neglected for too long   We need to secure our border and reform our immigration system now   We still have more work to do  but with President Bush  s support I believe this can become law             The bill also contains provisions toughening the physical enforcement of the border by construction of a   virtual   fence which relies on cameras  motion detectors and other technological devices to monitor illegal crossings into the United States   In certain high traffic areas  a real fence would be similar to the San Diego Border Fence  a state of the art nearly impenetrable barrier which made illegal entry into our nation much more difficult  will be constructed   In addition  the legislation calls for the hiring of an additional 12 000 additional Border Patrol agents over the next five years           The nation clearly has broken borders     said Graham     With this comprehensive immigration bill  the nation no longer has a broken Senate                                                                      April 2006 Press
