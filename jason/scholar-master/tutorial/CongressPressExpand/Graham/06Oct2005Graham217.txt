passed the Senate late last night   The amendment passed by unanimous consent          The United States desperately needs effective detention and interrogation policies     said Graham  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee     We need good intelligence and we need to keep terrorists off the battlefield   I  m confident we can do this while living up to the high standards we have always adhered to as a nation           The major provisions of the Graham amendment include         The President would be required to submit to Congress the procedures for the Combatant Status Review Tribunal  CSRT  and the Annual Review Board  ARB  at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  Gitmo    The CSRT is the tribunal that determines whether a detainee is an unlawful enemy combatant   The ARB reviews the combatant  s status on an annual basis to determine if the individual is an enemy combatant  still holds intelligence value and or  still presents a threat to the United States           The amendment requires the president to make two changes to current procedures   First  the Designated Civilian Official responsible for overseeing detainees in U S  custody would require Senate confirmation   Second  the CSRT and ARB may not consider statements obtained with undue coercion when determining the status of a detainee           The president is also given flexibility to update CSRT and ARB procedures by giving Congress 30 days notice             We must have procedures in place at Gitmo that will keep terrorists off the battlefield as long as necessary to protect our nation     said Graham     Without congressional authority we run a real risk a federal court will either take over or impede our efforts at Gitmo   We are winning in some courts and losing in others   I firmly believe the Executive branch will fair better in court now that Congress has given guidance regarding the operations at Gitmo             My amendment reforms and legitimizes the current system in use at Gitmo     said Graham     It bolsters the case in federal court that enemy combatant status is a proper and legal term   It also strengthens the legal case that conferring enemy combatant status on terrorists is a recognized legal concept           Graham  s amendment  along with one introduced by U S  Senator John McCain  R Arizona   were both approved last night by the Senate   The McCain amendment  which passed 90 9  requires interrogation procedures to be followed as outlined in the Army Field Manual and prohibits the use of cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment of anyone in military custody            We  re trying to create certainty from chaos     said Graham     The amendments give guidance to our troops to ensure they don  t get into legal trouble while detaining and interrogating terrorists   The McCain amendment will be invaluable in assisting our own troops in understanding the policies of interrogation   I firmly believe the confusion created in the past will be resolved by using the Army Field Manual as the standardized method of interrogating enemy combatants             Our troops will have guidance as to what the rules are and hopefully it will provide them protection when carrying out their duties when interrogating enemy combatants     said Graham     We don  t want our troops to run afoul of the law inadvertently
