                     The op ed appeared in newspapers across South Carolina beginning January 14  2007         The battle for the future of Iraq is not about the political moment   It  s about the next decade and the decades to follow   It  s about securing a peaceful future for our nation   We have a lot on the line and it  s important we do everything possible to achieve Victory in Iraq     It is clear to everyone from President Bush on down that our old strategy has not led to a secure Iraq   Ever since al Qaeda bombed the Golden Mosque  a Shiite holy site  the level of sectarian violence has escalated     The new plan introduced this week is controversial and has many critics and skeptics   I hope they will listen to the man who will carry out the new mission  General David Petraeus  when he testifies before Congress   He is an impressive leader and I  ve spoken with him about the path forward   He has confidence we can be successful         Unfortunately  some leaders such as Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi have already suggested we take a completely different tack and begin withdrawing troops from Iraq   My question to them and others who support withdrawal and redeployment of American forces is    What happens if we leave Iraq       A United States withdrawal or redeployment from the battle would leave Iraq in shambles   In all probability it would trigger a full blown civil war encompassing the large parts of Iraq that are currently stable   It could lead to a wider regional conflict involving neighboring nations including Iran  Syria  Saudi Arabia  Jordan  and Turkey and create a new safe haven for terrorist groups capable of striking the United States and our allies   We would face massive humanitarian disasters stemming from widespread revenge killings to ethnic cleansings       The extremists in the region  who already view the United States as a paper tiger would be emboldened   Withdrawing or redeploying from Iraq is not a sound  long term policy for the national security of the United States   It is a recipe for defeat     We must change strategy or we are going to lose Iraq   We have made many mistakes and from the start we never had enough troops on the ground   We  ve paid dearly for allowing the security situation to steadily decrease and making political reconciliation by the Iraqis more difficult       For some time I have been calling for additional American troops  even though I know it could result in more casualties and sacrifice  to help in efforts to establish a democracy   While we have won every engagement against the insurgents our Clear  Hold  and Build strategy has not worked because we could not   Hold   areas after they were   Cleared         Once we left  areas fell back into the insurgent  s control and violence escalated   You cannot establish democracy where you have militias stronger than the central government  You cannot have security when citizens don  t have faith in their central government to protect them     The five new brigades assigned to Baghdad will double our combat capability   They will assist the Iraqi forces in bringing about security and give the political leadership a reasonable chance to bring about stable government       One of the key political efforts is to reach agreement regarding the fair distribution of the oil revenues among the Sunni  Shia  and Kurds   A sharing of the wealth would give disenchanted Iraqis something to fight for  not against     President Bush has made it abundantly clear both the American and the Iraqi people are running out of patience   No amount of troops will change the future outcome unless Iraqi political leaders are willing to reach political accommodation     After five trips to Iraq  I believe many Iraqis are tired of the violence and seek a better way   Many have given their lives because of their willingness to serve their fellow citizens   Others remain afraid to come out of the shadows because chaos reigns     Over the coming weeks  Democrats and Republicans should be united around the fact that what happens in Iraq is directly tied to the future security of our nation       Do we want an Iraq at peace with its neighbors and an ally in the War on Terror   Or do we want an Iraq that is a safe haven for groups hostile to the United States  wracked by internal conflict and bloodshed  and a source of constant friction among neighboring nations     A final note  one of the highest reenlistment rates in the military is among those who have served in Iraq   I hope Congress and the American people will take this into consideration and ask themselves why their fellow American citizens    in the line of fire and in harms way    are so committed to this fight       They know history will not judge us on when we leave Iraq  but by what we leave behind                                                                  January 2007 Press
