                     NOTE  This op ed appeared in papers throughout South Carolina beginning Sunday  May 14  2006         South Carolinians are frustrated with our immigration system   They know the system is broken and we all pay the price          It  s a concern I share  along with President Bush  who I recently met with at the White House to discuss this issue   As a former border state governor  he clearly understands the seriousness of the immigration problem facing our nation and the need to comprehensively address the problem         So how do we get a handle on a situation currently out of control       First  we must secure our borders       Over the last decade  the number of people illegally crossing the border has dramatically increased   Without better border security any congressional immigration reform is going to fail          Under the Senate immigration compromise I support  we will authorize the hiring of 12 000 new Border Patrol agents over the next 5 years   We also create fences and walls in certain high traffic areas to prevent illegal crossing   In other areas  we create a   virtual   fence which relies on cameras  motion detectors and other technological devices          I authored a provision  accepted in committee  which gets more individuals with military backgrounds into the Border Patrol   Due to modernization  in the coming years we  re expected to have a reduced number of people serving in some areas of the military  These veterans  with years of military experience and training  are excellent candidates to serve in our expanded Border Patrol       Second  increase employer enforcement and verification of legal workers     Comprehensive immigration reform should simplify our laws to solve the problems facing employers   In the compromise  we establish an efficient worker verification system that lets employers know if the person standing before them can legally work in the United States          Particularly important is preventing the rampant fraud in our current system where Social Security numbers and drivers licenses are fraudulently procured   Replacing that system with a tamper proof verification card containing fingerprints and other identifying data of guest workers would be beneficial        After reforming the system and giving employers the opportunity to comply with new laws  it  s imperative we have the national will to punish employers who intentionally break the law           We have been too lax in enforcement of our employment laws   With winks and nods people looked the other way as illegal immigrants filled positions   As a result the illegal workforce has become firmly entrenched in some of our state  s largest and most important industries such as agriculture  construction  and tourism         Third  address the estimated eleven million illegal immigrants in the U S     We must come up with an honest and rational solution on how to treat those who are already in this country illegally          Like President Bush  I don  t think we  re physically able remove eleven million illegal immigrants   We do not have the resources or detention space to do this   Also  an immediate roundup and deportation of this workforce would send our economy into a tailspin   This   solution   is simply not an option        The Senate compromise brings illegal immigrants already in the U S  more than two years out of the shadows and requires them to meet rigorous standards in order to remain in our country         In essence  we place them on 11 years of probation   The terms are strict but fair          They will have to register with the government  be proficient in English  show proof of employment  pay  2 000 in fines  undergo 2 extensive and comprehensive background checks to ensure they do not have a criminal record or pose a danger to society  pay back taxes  and attend a class on American civics          Failure to meet any of these requirements would result in deportation   Guest workers must meet very strict criteria over an eleven year period before going to the back of the line to apply for citizenship          The program isn  t amnesty   Amnesty is what President Carter gave to draft dodgers who fled to Canada          Our immigration system has been in disarray for so long there are generations of families with legal and illegal members   Some families have parents here illegally and children that are American citizens   Some husbands are illegal while the wives are legal          More importantly  there are many military members  particularly young Hispanic Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who are legal citizens by virtue of being born in America   They have chosen to fight and die for their country   Creating felons out of their parents  illegally in the country  is not going to make America a better place        The last days of the Senate session before Easter recess represented the best and worst of the United States Senate   Our comprehensive immigration reform bill combining border security  employer verification  and guest worker provisions would have garnered near 70 votes on the Senate floor   The substance of the deal held  only to be hijacked by the unfair procedural tactics of Democratic Leader Harry Reid          It  s now time for the Senate to get back to work
