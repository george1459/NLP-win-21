Immigration Reform                                                                                                                                                                                                              Many South Carolinians have contacted the office about immigration reform   Here is some expanded information on the subject and thoughts on the Senate legislation from Senator Graham         I agree with President Bush  our current immigration laws are complex and unworkable   The physical security along our border is porous and in some areas  nearly non existent   Combine these factors with spotty or lax enforcement of employment laws  and we have created the immigration situation we find ourselves in today       South Carolinians are rightly frustrated with our immigration system   They know the system is broken and we all pay the price   This is a concern I share    It is also why Congress and President Bush should continue to work together to bring some order to the chaos that exists right now       Here is a brief rundown of my views on immigration reform and how the Senate began to address these issues   I hope in the coming months the House of Representatives  Senate and President can come to some agreement on immigration reform   Each day we delay in securing our border  creating a workable employer verification system and creating a process to deal with the undocumented workers already in the United States only makes our immigration problems worse      Border Security   The first issue to address in immigration reform must be border security   Over the last decade  the number of illegal border crossings has dramatically increased   Without better border security  any immigration reform is sure to fail         One reason I supported the Senate immigration reform bill is because it addresses the long overdue and much needed effort to regain control of our perimeters   Among the major provisions  it authorizes the hiring of an additional 14 000 Border Patrol agents over the next five years   It also calls for the construction of at least 370 miles of triple layer fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers to be placed in high traffic border crossing areas where people can literally walk into the United States        In more remote locations  it calls for the creation of a   virtual   fence   This fence would use some of our most advanced technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs   remote surveillance camera systems  motion detectors  and other technological devices to enhance the effectiveness of our Border Patrol       It also ends the   Catch and Release   program where illegal immigrants detained by the Border Patrol are released and ordered to report to court at a future date   Needless to say  very few complied with the order  returned to court  and faced deportation   Now  because the Senate bill authorizes the construction of 20 new detention facilities capable of housing 20 000 detainees  we will be able to detain  house  and eventually deport them back to their home country when they are apprehended       While I support strengthening our border  I also realize that better border security alone will not adequately address our nation  s immigration problems   Almost half of the illegal immigrants in the United States today have overstayed their legally issued visas  and never crossed the border illegally  These illegal immigrants came to the United States as tourists  students or workers and never left the country       We must also remember that many rely on being able to legally cross our borders to continue in their businesses and day to day lives   Not all southern border crossings are illegal or pose a threat to the security of the United States   In fact  there are 350 million legal crossings between the United States and Mexico each year in the exchange of good and services   Each day nearly 1 million people legally cross at one of the entry points on the United States Mexico border      Employee Verification and Employer Enforcement   While the first issue to address in immigration reform must be border security  this alone provides a false sense of security and must be coupled with a workable employee verification system   Immigration is about jobs   We need to control who gets jobs  and how they get them         Creating an effective worker verification system that lets employers know whether a job applicant can legally work in the United States is a key element for successful immigration reform   The rampant fraud associated with the use of Social Security numbers and drivers licenses has put employers in a no win situation for determining whether a person can legally work in the United States         If an employer questions the applicant  s documents too closely  they can face charges of discrimination   If they are too lax  they can be cited for not checking closely enough and hiring an illegal worker   In one case  an American company was under investigation by the United States Department of Justice for committing both offenses at the same time    This is why the Senate  s plan to institute a tamper proof biometric worker verification card is so important   Under the plan  guest workers would be issued the card which contains biometric identifiers  such as digital fingerprints   This would enable employers to differentiate between legal and illegal workers before hiring them       After reforming the system and giving employers ample opportunity to comply with the new system  we must exercise the will to punish those who intentionally break the law   The Senate bill authorizes the hiring of 5 000 new interior enforcement investigators over the next 5 years to uphold our employment laws         We have been too lax in the enforcement of our well intentioned but inadequate and confusing employment laws   As a result  the illegal workforce has become firmly entrenched in some of our state  s largest and most important industries such as agriculture  construction and tourism       Employers in many industries  including those crucial to South Carolina  s economy  need workers and want to hire them legally   We must provide the tools they need to not only comply with the law  but also to stay in business   Creating a workable employee verification system will also free up the enforcement officers to go after the unscrupulous businesses who knowingly violate our employment laws   They should be forced to comply with the stricter standards and penalties contained in the Senate bill  or face the consequences and end up behind bars       Undocumented Workers   We must come up with an honest and rational solution on how to treat the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in our country   Like President Bush  I don  t think we are capable of  nor have the national will to  deport 11 million people   Further  an immediate roundup and deportation of this workforce would have negative consequences for our economy  potentially sending it into a tailspin  This   solution   is not practical and therefore is simply not an option        The Senate compromise brings illegal immigrants already in the United States more than two years out of the shadows and requires them to meet rigorous standards in order to remain in our country        In essence  they are placed on 11 years of probation   The terms are strict but fair   They include            Undocumented workers must come out of the shadows and register with the government        Pay  3 200 in fines and penalties        Be proficient in the English language        Stay employed        Undergo 2 comprehensive background checks to ensure they do not have a criminal record or pose a danger to society        Pay all back taxes        Register with the military Selective Service        Attend American civics and government classes   Failure to meet any of these requirements would result in deportation   Not every undocumented worker who applies for the program will meet the requirements   Those who don  t measure up to the standards we put in place will face deportation         Those who do meet the terms above    over a 6 year period    would be allowed to go to the back of the line to apply for citizenship   On average  waiting to become an American citizen after the application is filed takes 5 years   This means that from the time an undocumented worker enters this program until they become a citizen  there would be at least an 11 year wait   If we have not cleared the current immigration backlog in that period  the immigrant won  t be able to apply for citizenship until we do         The program is not amnesty   Amnesty is what President Carter gave to Vietnam draft dodgers who fled to Canada   This approach represents a rational middle ground between those who want to grant an automatic path to citizenship for all undocumented workers and those who want every one to leave   In addition  it is important to note that the Senate passed immigration bill does not make illegal aliens eligible to receive Social Security benefits         Our immigration system has been in disarray for so long there are generations of families with legal and illegal members   Some families have parents here illegally and children that are American citizens   Some husbands are illegal while the wives are legal   More importantly  there are many members of our military  particularly young Hispanic Marines  serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who are legal citizens by virtue of being born in America   They have chosen to fight and die for our country   Creating felons out of their parents  illegally in the country  is not the way to thank them for their service  and will not make America a better place      Conclusion   Immigration is a complex issue  One aspect that has been particularly contentious among all Americans is constructing a fence to run the full length of the United States Mexico border         Many South Carolinians support additional fencing and I agree with them  However  this idea is not universally accepted    even among border state legislators who would be most affected   The state of Texas shares a 1 200 mile border with Mexico and is the site of many legal and illegal border crossings   However  the Republican Senators from Texas split over the issue of creating a border fence   One Senator is open to the idea while the other views it as impractical   This split illustrates how difficult it can be to reach consensus on these issues even among legislators who normally agree       As Americans  we need to keep in mind the debate surrounding immigration is not a new one   As a nation of immigrants  we have had disagreements about how many immigrants we should absorb  their original nationality  and the impact they were having on the United States   Immigration is part of our history and among the founding principles of this nation          I strongly believe that working together we can address our immigration problems and allow our country to move toward a more prosperous future
