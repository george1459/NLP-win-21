Lindsey Graham and Jim DeMint announced their support for the House Senate highway conference report   The surface transportation bill provides  286 4 billion in federal highway contract authority between 2004 and 2009  and is expected to pass the Senate and the House later this week   President Bush is expected to sign the legislation soon after          I  m very pleased we were able to get a deal that is more responsible for taxpayers     said Senator DeMint  a member of the House and Senate conference committee     This bill is not perfect but it  s a good step forward   I would have liked it to spend even less overall and to return even more to South Carolina  but this bill is a good compromise that stays within the budget and provides important benefits for our state             The highway bill is very good news for motorists in South Carolina     said Graham     As a state  we were able to secure a more equitable funding formula which will put additional dollars toward our road system   It truly moves the ball forward in our efforts to build new roads while maintaining and improving the ones we currently have   I  m also pleased we were able to do it without breaking the federal bank   The bill is more fiscally responsible than the first version of the highway bill Senator DeMint and I voted against              In May  Senators DeMint and Graham voted against the original version of the bill that significantly exceeded budget authority   Their opposition  along with a veto threat from the President  pressured negotiators to agree on a more responsible bill that limits the six year cost to  286 4 billion from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal 2009   Negotiators originally wanted to pass a  375 billion bill but the final compromise was much less  saving taxpayers over billions of dollars        The highway conference report includes several important benefits for South Carolina secured by Senators Graham and DeMint   Under the new highway program  a better formula will return more federal gas tax dollars to South Carolina   South Carolina will ultimately receive 92 percent back on every dollar it sends to Washington in gas taxes  which is a meaningful increase from the 90 5 percent the state has received since 1998  The bill authorizes a total of over  2 9 billion for South Carolina over the six year life of the program  an increase of nearly twenty eight percent         The conference report also includes a new safety program that will give states greater flexibility in addressing safety needs   This program will provide for safety improvements such as adding rumble strips  widening lanes  installing guard rails  and creating additional signage   All public roads are eligible for this new safety funding  benefiting states like South Carolina that have a high percentage of state maintained roads          This bill accomplishes one of my top goals for the year by giving our state more control over our highway dollars     DeMint said     But much more still needs to be done   I hope that the next reauthorization will address serious reforms and give states full control over their highways   The federal program was created to develop an interstate highway system  but that system has been created and now we need to let the states run it             I truly appreciate the work done by Jim  DeMint  and Henry  Brown  on the highway bill     said Graham     They  ve been leaders in this area and we all owe them a debt of gratitude for what they  ve been able to accomplish   Making sure our state was treated in a fair and equitable manner was a team effort  but these two guys served as team captains and deserve a great deal of credit           In addition to several important policy changes the conference report provides a fair share for South Carolina by authorizing over  2 9 billion in funding for transportation and infrastructure projects all across South Carolina   Specifically  the bill provides for  81 million in authorized funding for I 73 in the Pee Dee   26 6 million for US 278 in Beaufort County   11 6 million for the Palmetto Parkway in Aiken County   6 8 million for Highway 9 in Spartanburg County   4 million for Highway 5 in York County  among many others                                                                      July 2005 Press Releases           Browse by
