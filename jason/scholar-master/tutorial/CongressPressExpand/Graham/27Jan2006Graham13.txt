Nebraska  yesterday introduced a bipartisan resolution supporting the National Guard and requesting the Department of Defense seek input from Congress and governors when deciding future changes to National Guard personnel and calling on the Pentagon to resolve equipment shortages   Graham and Nelson are the Chairman and Ranking Member  respectively  of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee          At this crucial time in our nation  s history  we are more dependent on the National Guard than ever     said U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina      Now is not the time to diminish the role the reserves play in the American military   I look forward to working with Senator Nelson  who has been a good friend to the National Guard  to ensure our reserve forces are properly structured               The members of our National Guard aren  t   weekend warriors       said Senator Nelson    They  re indispensable citizen soldiers  airmen and airwomen who serve their country full time when needed  and in return  I expect the Department of Defense to fully support the National Guard missions here and around the world           The National Guard has a unique role in defending the nation  Guard troops have a dual responsibility  to the nation and to their home states  The Department of Defense is proposing cuts in personnel levels for the Guard and the Guard is plagued by significant shortages of critical equipment         The resolution calls for the Department of Defense to        Fully fund the equipment needs of the National Guard    Consult with Congress and the nation  s governors as soon as possible on any proposed changes to the National Guard force structure    Consider the National Guard  s role in homeland defense when considering the National Guard  s force structure    Create budget projections that detail cost savings from any National Guard force structure changes  as well as projected costs in the event large personnel increases are necessary to respond to a homeland defense emergency    Ensure Congress and our nation  s governors that potential personnel cuts will not impact the safety and security of the American people           The resolution arrives as the future of the National Guard is currently being determined by the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR          Despite and as a result of their significant work  the National Guard continues to experience equipment shortages  Last November  Senators Nelson  Graham and 40 other senators from both political parties sent President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a letter urging them to fully fund the National Guard         The guard is experiencing equipment deficiencies all over the country including shortages of humvees  rough terrain trucks  over the road tractors  wreckers  semi trailers  communication equipment  and weapon mounts for trucks        The resolution is supported by the National Guard Association of the United States         Also  current co sponsors of the bipartisan resolution include Senators  Ben Nelson  NE   Lindsey Graham  SC   George Allen  VA   Jim Talent  MO   Elizabeth Dole  NC   Olympia
