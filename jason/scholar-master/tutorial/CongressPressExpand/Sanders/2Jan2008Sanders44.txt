EARTH TO BUSH
  The middle class is shrinking, manufacturing jobs are disappearing, poverty is increasing, but from President Bush's perspective, "we've had a pretty good economic run here in the country." The same day in December when Bush made that preposterous claim at a Rotary Club meeting, the U.S Conference of Mayors reported that foreclosures, increased living expenses and higher food costs were leaving more families hungry, with four out of five cities surveyed reporting that requests for emergency food assistance had increased over the last year. The fact is that during the past seven years while Bush was president the economy has made it more difficult for most Americans to get ahead. The basic goals of the American dream - raising a family, owning a home, paying for college, saving for retirement - have become hurdles for hardworking people. Slow wage growth has been compounded by double-digit cost increases for health care, energy, and college tuition. Bush says the economy is "pretty good?" What planet is he living on? 
   According to a new Joint Economic Committee report, the average monthly health care premium rose 39.7 percent from 2000 to 2005. Vermont college tuitions rose 14.9 percent since 1999. The cost of child care for a two-child family in Vermont now averages $1,194 per month.
