SEN. SANDERS: BRING OUR TROOPS HOME
  In the coming week, the Senate is set to debate legislation that calls for a troop withdrawal from Iraq. Having originally voted against the war, Sen. Sanders has been an outspoken advocate for bringing our troops home as soon as possible.  
   "We have got to use the budget to tell the president that this war cannot go on. We have to bring our troops home as soon as possible," Senator Sanders told Thom Hartmann during his weekly Air America interview program "Brunch with Bernie." 
   More than 3200 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq, and Vermont has suffered more casualties per capita than any other state. To learn more about the toll the war has taken on Vermont and the nation, visit the Faces of the Fallen feature on the Washington Post's website.
