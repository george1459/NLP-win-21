SEN. SANDERS WRITES TO SECRETARY CHAO REQUESTING INVESTIGATION ON KILLINGTON
  The Honorable Elaine L. Chao
  Secretary
  U.S. Department of Labor
  200 Constitution Avenue, NW 
  Washington, DC 20210 
   Dear Secretary Chao:
   I am writing to request that the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) conduct an investigation to make sure that Powdr Corp., the new owner of the Killington and Pico Ski Resorts, and Killington, Ltd., are in full compliance with all of the applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the H-2B visa program.
   As you know, employers applying for H-2B visas must first certify that capable U.S. workers are not available, efforts were made to recruit U.S. workers for these positions first, and the employment of alien workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers (C.F.R. 655). 
   According to the latest data available on the United States Department of Labor's Employment and Training website, in 2006, Killington Ltd. was certified to receive H-2B visas for the following positions: 15 Athletic Trainers; 25 Snowmakers; 85 Ski Tow Operators; 47 Housekeeping Cleaners; and 8 Sports Instructors. 
   Today, it was reported in today's Rutland Herald that that Powdr Corp., the new owner of the Killington and Pico Ski Resorts in Vermont, fired a number of its full-time employees, while they do not intend to reduce their seasonal employment. 
   When a company fires a significant number of U.S. workers while employing H-2B workers, as appears to be the case in this instance, the ETA should investigate to make sure that company is complying with all of the pertinent laws and regulations. 
   Therefore, I respectfully ask that the Department of Labor investigate this important matter. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this issue.
   Sincerely, 
  Bernard Sanders 
  United States Senator
