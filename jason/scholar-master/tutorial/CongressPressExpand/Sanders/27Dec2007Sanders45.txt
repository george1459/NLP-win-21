TRAGEDY IN PAKISTAN
  Today, tragedy struck Pakistan and the world dealt with the shock of losing Benazir Bhutto. The former Pakistani prime minister, the first female leader of a Muslim nation, was assassinated. Reacting to this tragic news, Senator Sanders said, "Despite the grave dangers she faced, Benazir Bhutto showed enormous courage by continuing to participate in Pakistan's democratic process. I am saddened and outraged by this cowardly assassination and I urge the Pakistani government to undertake a vigorous investigation to apprehend those responsible for this terrible deed. Pakistan, a nation armed with nuclear weapons, is now in the midst of dangerous political crisis. The United States must increase its diplomatic efforts in working with the democratic forces in Pakistan to promote stability, democracy and peace." 
   Ms. Bhutto, 54, was first elected prime minister in 1988. Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was also a prime minister of Pakistan. She was murdered on Thursday at a political rally.
