SEN. SANDERS TO MEET WITH SENIORS ADVISORY COUNCIL
  Sen. Bernie Sanders will meet Monday with his newly formed Seniors Advisory Council at his U.S. Senate office in Burlington. After the first meeting, the senator and members of the advisory council will hold a press conference on legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. 
   Sanders was the first member of Congress to take constituents across the Canadian border to buy prescription drugs at a fraction of the price charged in the United States. He plans to press as early as next week for a Senate vote on re-importation legislation proposed by a tri-partisan coalition that Sanders has helped lead for the past eight years since his 1999 bus trip to Canada. He also favors making Medicare use its bargaining leverage to lower the costs of prescription drugs, a step that Senate Republicans blocked on Wednesday.
   Throughout his career in Congress, Sanders has taken on the powerful pharmaceutical industry lobby that spent more than $900 million during the past decade to influence Congress to keep drug prices high.
