SEN. SANDERS COMMENTS ON U.S.-PERU TRADE AGREEMENT
  Senator Bernie Sanders made the following statement on a United State-Peru trade agreement the Senate approved today: 
   "What the overwhelming majority of the American people understand is that our trade policy has been a complete failure, it has been bad for the U.S. economy, and it has caused the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs.
   "The Peru Free Trade Agreement is a continuation of failed agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China. Instead of enacting yet another job-destroying, unfettered free trade agreement, it is time for us to fix our broken trade policies.
   "We need to negotiate trade agreements that protect middle-class American workers, not just the CEOs of big corporations."
