SEN. SANDERS OFFERS AMENDMENT TO COMBAT POVERTY IN AMERICA TO MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  Sen. Bernie Sanders today offered an amendment on the Senate floor to combat pervasive poverty in America as part of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that we have a moral obligation to improve the lives of the nearly 37 million Americans living in poverty, eradicate childhood poverty, and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. A full copy of Senator Sanders' floor statement is attached.  
   Sanders said, "Despite the fact that the United States is the richest country in the history of the world, nearly 13 percent of our citizens are living in poverty and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country in the industrialized world. In my opinion we have a moral responsibility to end child poverty in this country and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor." 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the childhood poverty rate is nearly 18%. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent and the CEOs of our largest corporations now earn over 800 times what a minimum wage earner makes. Sanders' amendment would call on the President to submit a plan to Congress which eradicates childhood poverty over the next decade and reduces the gap between the rich and the poor. 
   Sanders said, "We have got to come up with a plan to address persistent poverty in this country. Increasing the minimum wage is a great first step, but we have got to do more, and that is what this amendment is all about."
