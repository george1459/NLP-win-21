SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON TRADE DEAL
  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement regarding an agreement on trade pacts reached after secret negotiations by the Bush administration and congressional leaders: 
   "At a time when the middle class is shrinking, and when we have lost millions of good paying jobs because of our disastrous trade policies, it is clear to me that Congress needs to make a fundamental re-examination of trade policies so that they represent the needs of American workers and not just large multinational corporations.
   "Given the enormous importance of this issue, it is very disappointing that these negotiations took place behind closed doors and without more open discussion in the Senate and the House.
   "As Vermont's Senator, I intend to see that this discussion takes place, and that the needs of ordinary Americans are put ahead of the needs of CEOs of large corporations."
