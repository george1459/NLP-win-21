HAS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WORKED?
  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 required states to improve public schools for all students in exchange for increased federal aid. Has the bargain been honored? Has it worked? With the law authorizing the program about to expire, should it be extended or should it be scrapped? If it is broken, can it be fixed? Sen. Bernie Sanders and a group of Vermont educators on Tuesday evening will hold a town meeting at Burlington High School to discuss No Child Left Behind. Sanders is a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Also participating in the discussion will be Jeanne Collins, superintendent of Burlington School District; Ned Kirsch, principal of Essex Middle School; Dave Cobb, principal of Lyndon Town School; Vicki Wells, director of student services, Addison Central S.U., and Nancy Thomas, assistant superintendent of special services, Washington Central S.U. The panel will hear from Vermont teachers, principals, support staff and other educators about their experiences and views.
