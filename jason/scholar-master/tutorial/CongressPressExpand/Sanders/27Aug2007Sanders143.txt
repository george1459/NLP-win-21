SEN. SANDERS: ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES IS GONE
  Senator Bernie Sanders months ago called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. The senator had voiced concern about privacy abuses by the FBI and the lingering controversy over the firing of federal prosecutors. "It was past time for him to go. He had not been honest with Congress. His credibility was shot. He has not respected the Constitution," Sanders said. 
   Sanders added that the confirmation process could be a healthy refresher course in constitutional values.
   "I think it's time for the Congress to tell the president that we have a Constitution in this country which protects the basic rights of the American people. He cannot do anything he wants whenever he wants. Let's get an attorney general in this country who can be effective in helping to protect the American people from terrorism while at the same time understands what the Constitution is about and respects basic civil liberties of the American people."
