JOINING FORCES TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING
  From a march on Montpelier to glaciers on Mount Rainier, from Norwich Green to the levees in New Orleans, Vermonters and people who care about our planet all across America are joining forces to stop global warming. The Vermont-based Step It Up 2007 coordinated events Saturday in all 50 states to call on Congress to cut carbon emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050.  
   "The grass roots organizing effort that Step It Up is making in Vermont and all over this country, bringing thousands of people together to say that we've got to reverse global warming, we've got to support strong legislation in Washington, is exactly the right thing to do," said Senator Bernie Sanders. He is the chief author of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the only bill before the U.S. Senate that would reduce emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
   The only member of the Senate majority who serves on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sanders introduced the global warming legislation with Senator Barbara Boxer, who chairs the environment panel. Senator Patrick Leahy is a cosponsor of the bill that former Vice President Al Gore called "an excellent piece of legislation."
   Said Sanders: "If we can organize at the grass-roots level we can reverse global warming, we can protect our planet and, in the process, we can create millions of good-paying jobs as we move away from fossil fuels and move to energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
