SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS IN HEALTH CARE
  The Senate this week is considering a bill, cosponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, that would expand and encourage federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research. President Bush in 2001 cut off federal funding for research involving new embryonic stem cells, which has dramatically stalled this critical area of medical research.  
   "My hope is that, as a result of increased pressure from scientists, physicians and the American people, the president will change his position or, if he does not, that the Congress will have enough votes to override his veto and establish unrestricted federal funding for stem cell research," Sanders said. "The potential is now available for major breakthroughs in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injury, stroke, heart disease and many other illnesses. We must seize the opportunity."
