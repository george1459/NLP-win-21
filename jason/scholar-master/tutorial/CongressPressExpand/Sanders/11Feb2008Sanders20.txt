CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR WHITE RIVER VA EXPANSION
  Vermont's Congressional Delegation - Sen. Patrick Leahy (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I), and Rep. Peter Welch (D) - announced today that the White River Junction VA Medical Center has been awarded $900,000 for designing a new imaging center and expanding its radiology services. The medical center will be eligible for an additional $6 million for construction next year. 
   The funding will allow the VA to plan and design the 6,996 sq. ft. expansion and renovation to the current facility. The project will enhance radiology services for veterans and provide space for a permanent MRI machine. 
   Leahy said, "To remain one of the country's leading VA medical centers, White River Junction needs the latest equipment and facilities. The new imaging center will create the space to bring in the most technologically advanced diagnostic and treatment sensors, keeping the hospital at the leading edge. It will help provide the state-of-the-art quality care that our veterans deserve."
   Sanders said, "This funding is good news for Vermont veterans. These resources will allow White River Junction's VA to both add new space for a permanent MRI and renovate existing space so that Vermont veterans have top-notch radiology services. As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I look forward to making sure that these funds are delivered to the White River VA in a timely manner."
   Welch said, "I regularly talk with Vermont veterans who are forced to travel out of state for their medical care. This radiology expansion will help increase the services our White River Junction's VA provides so our veterans can get more of the care they need right here at home. Our veterans are entitled to the best and most cutting-edge care we can provide."
