SEN. SANDERS PAYS TRIBUTE TO LT. DOOLEY
  The families of fallen service members from Vermont gathered this weekend at Arlington National Cemetery to console one another as they interred the remains of Lt. Mark H. Dooley. During a special ceremony at the cemetery, a flag flown over the United States Capitol was presented to Lt. Dooley's mother, Marion, by Senators Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders and Congressman Peter Welch. 
   A First Lieutenant in the Vermont Army National Guard and a platoon leader in Task Force Saber, Lt. Dooley, 27, was killed by an Improvised Explosive Device while on a routine patrol mission in 2005 in Ramadi. Lt. Dooley had completed his studies at Norwich University in December of 2001 and was conferred a degree in Political Science and History in May of 2002. Before his deployment to Iraq, he was a police officer in Wilmington and served with Company A of the 3-172nd Infantry Mountain Battalion from Jericho, Vermont.
   The families were accompanied to Arlington by the makers of Vermont Fallen, a documentary memorial to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the Iraq war. Produced by Norwich University, the film project was inspired by the fact that Vermont has experienced the greatest per capita loss of lives in the Iraq war.
