SENATE VOTES ON BUDGET AMENDMENTS
  The Senate on Thursday ploughed through a series of votes on amendments to a $3 trillion budget blueprint including a 43 to 55 roll call rejecting a proposal by Senator Bernie Sanders to rescind tax breaks for millionaires. 
   "While I am disappointed, we are making progress and raising consciousness about the need to change our national priorities," Sanders said afterward.
   The three major presidential candidates interrupted their campaigns to cast key votes on the budget. Senators Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) both voted for the Sanders Amendment. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) did not vote.
   Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) voted with Sanders as the Senate worked into the night to finish this stage of the annual budget process that creates the framework for appropriations bills.
   Sanders' amendment would have rescinded tax breaks for the top 0.3 percent of taxpayers with incomes over $1 million a year. It would have raised $32.5 billion over the next three years, revenue Sanders wanted to devote to special education, Head Start, school construction, children's nutrition programs and deficit reduction.
   During debate on his amendment, Sanders told colleagues: "The wealthiest people in this country have not had it so good since the 1920s, incomes are soaring while the middle class is shrinking and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country. The time is now to change our national priorities and move the country in a different direction."
