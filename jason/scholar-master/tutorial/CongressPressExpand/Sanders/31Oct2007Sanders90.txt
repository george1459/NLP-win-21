CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
  As Verizon Wireless moves ahead in Vermont to acquire the competing mobile phone company Unicel, Senator Bernie Sanders has asked the Federal Communications Commission to step in to protect the interests of Vermont consumers and businesses. If Verizon is to be handed a virtual Vermont monopoly, the telecommunications giant must guarantee that it will provide cell service throughout the state. "We should ask them to provide universal geographic coverage. They should make sure that all of our people have access to cell phone service in every town and every part of the state." Sanders said. The senator also has voiced concerns about incompatible cell phone technologies. For example, would all cell phones work in an emergency? Would a skier visiting from out of state be able to make calls from Stowe on their iPhone? He wants the FCC to place conditions on the proposed merger if it is allowed to go through.
