SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF THE UNION
  Sen. Bernie Sanders said, "Tonight we heard further evidence that this President is out of touch with the reality and needs of the American people. At a time when our citizens want to wind-down the war in Iraq and bring our troops home as soon as possible, the President has proposed escalating it. Instead of leading us towards universal health care, he wants to tax workers' health care benefits and cut funding for hospitals serving the lowest-income Americans. Instead of offering the meaningful policies needed to combat global warming and position our nation as a leader in clean energy he continues to offer only empty rhetoric. The American people cannot afford these backwards policies. It's time for bold action that will end the quagmire in Iraq, ensure that every Americans receives health care as a right of citizenship, and protect our environment for future generations."
