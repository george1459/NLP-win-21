SEN. SANDERS PAYS TRIBUTE TO MEN, WOMEN IN MILITARY
  In a time of war, Memorial Day takes on special significance as our nation honors men and women in the military who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
   Memorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, was first observed following the Civil War to commemorate the soldiers who gave their lives in order to preserve our union. After World War I, the day of remembrance was expanded to honor the fallen from all wars fought by the United States.
   Vermont has suffered disproportionately during the war in Iraq. We have lost more lives per capita than any other state. That was the inspiration for Vermont's Fallen, a widely-acclaimed documentary produced by students at Norwich University in Northfield. It is an especially moving tribute to those who lost their lives in Iraq and to their families and friends.
   As the nation marks this Memorial Day weekend, we also should bear in mind the debt we owe to the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan along with veterans who served before them. In this spirit, Senator Sanders has introduced the Comprehensive Veterans Benefits Improvement Act. The legislation would improve health care, insurance, housing, pension, and other benefits for our nation's veterans. It also would address the huge backlog of health care claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs. "It is the least we can do to show our appreciation for those who sacrifice for their country," Sanders said.
