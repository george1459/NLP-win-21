SEN. SANDERS: 'WE MUST BRING OUR TROOPS HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE'
  President Bush is trying to create an illusion of change in Iraq, but in reality he is continuing the same disastrous war that he misled us into. Stay-the-course is the wrong course. In testimony before Senate committees, General David H. Petraeus was asked, 'General, when is this war going to end? One year? Two years? Five years?' He had nothing to say. "So we're looking now at a war that has gone on longer than the war against Hitler, and the American people are saying enough is enough," Senator Bernie Sanders said. "We must bring our troops home as soon as possible." 
   General Petraeus's testimony, Senator Sanders told Vermont Public Radio, is part of an ongoing effort by the Bush administration to mislead the American public about the war. "The fact that you are having Petraeus's report on 9/11 continues the mythology that the war in Iraq has something to do with the al Qaeda attack against the United States in 2001. Obviously it doesn't."
   Asked about reports that the president is expected to seek an additional $50 billion to finance the war, the senator said, "I will support the strongest legislation available and will be fighting for it to end this war as soon as possible to bring our troops home and certainly defunding this war is one appropriate step."
   In a separate interview broadcast September 11 on BBC World News, he said, "We need a whole new approach to combating international terrorism. While we are bogged down in Iraq spending billions and billions of dollars, Osama bin Laden remains free. Al Qaeda is growing in strength. The Afghanistan situation is deteriorating. Pakistan is deteriorating. Al-Qaeda is growing all over the world."
