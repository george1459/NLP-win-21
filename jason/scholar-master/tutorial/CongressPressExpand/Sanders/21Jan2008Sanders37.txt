MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY
  As we remember the brave and visionary life of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., we can think of his civil rights and workers' rights legacies. Much of our progress in civil rights has only been possible because of the contributions of Dr. King. Yet, we have a great many things left to do in order to fully realize his vision. His civil rights legacy is invaluable, and unfinished. In addition, Dr. King was a vocal leader in support of organized workers. He was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was showing his support of striking sanitation workers. Today, we must continue to fight for the rights and dignity of all Americans. We all have a role to play in this work. This is a day to remember Dr. King and what he meant to America. Tomorrow is a day to continue working towards his goals.
