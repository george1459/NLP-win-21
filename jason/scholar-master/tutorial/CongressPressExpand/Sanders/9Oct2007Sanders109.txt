SEN. SANDERS WILL HOLD SERIES OF TOWN MEETINGS TRAVELING ACROSS VERMONT
  Senator Bernie Sanders is traveling across Vermont this week holding a series of town meetings. About 200 people attended "Brunch with Bernie" on Sunday in South Burlington, where the senator told reporters, "The reason that I like doing these events is that it's important for me to hear what is on peoples' minds." He added, "It's amazing how often you learn things that you did not know." Summing up events in Washington, Sanders said, "The good news is, we passed a higher education funding bill which is the most important legislation to make college affordable that we have seen in many, many decades. That's a step forward. I think you're going to see the largest increase in funding for the Veterans Administration." On Monday, he traveled to the Northeast Kingdom for a town meeting in St. Johnsbury that focused on economic issues. Global warming was the issue of the day on Tuesday, when he was slated to host a town meeting at the University of Vermont. The senator is headed to St. Albans on Wednesday to meet with Department of Homeland Security workers.
