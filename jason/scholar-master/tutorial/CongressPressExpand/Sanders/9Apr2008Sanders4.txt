REAL STORIES FROM REAL AMERICANS ABOUT MIDDLE CLASS COLLAPSE
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) went to the Senate floor today to read from some of the hundreds of email messages he has received from people in Vermont and across America about their struggles coping with rising prices in a shrinking economy. 
   More than 500 emails were sent to Sanders in the week since he posted a video on his Senate Web page asking people for their personal accounts. 
   He called the outpouring "powerful and overwhelming." The messages, he added, had an "articulateness that comes from telling the truth, from talking from their hearts."
