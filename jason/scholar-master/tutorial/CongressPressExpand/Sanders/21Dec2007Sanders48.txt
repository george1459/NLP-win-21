BEST WISHES
  The men and women of Congress have returned home to be with their families and constituents for the winter holidays. A lot of work has been done, but much much more is needed to get our country moving in the right direction again. On the west lawn of the U.S. Capital, a magnificent Balsam fir today brings a taste Vermont to the nation's capital. The tree was harvested from Vermont's Green Mountain National Forest. In Vermont, snow covers much of the state. Whether you are a winter sports enthusiast enjoying the snow-covered mountains or you prefer the indoors when the mercury drops, be safe, be warm, and enjoy your time with loved ones. 
   This is also a time of year in which people may want to reach out to those less fortunate. In which case, please contact your local aid organizations to see what you can do. To read about problems at shelters in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, click here.
   The holiday season is also a time to take a moment to thank the service provided and the sacrifices given by our men and women in uniform. Senator Sanders recently wrote a letter published by the Caledonian-Record outlining some ways you can thank our soldiers, which you can read here.
   You can watch the tree-lighting ceremony on our Web site. The event, attended by the entire Vermont congressional delegation and the Speaker of the House, was a highlight of the season in Washington this year. Look out for the complete video of the event on your local public access station or you can watch excerpts of the ceremony here or to view pictures of the tree, visit http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=288495.
