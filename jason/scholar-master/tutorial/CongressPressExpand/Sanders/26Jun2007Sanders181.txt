SEN. SANDERS AMENDMENT TO PROHIBIT COMPANIES FROM HIRING TEMPORARY GUEST WORKERS IF THEY RECENTLY FIRED U.S. WORKERS
  Immigration legislation now before the Senate would let employers in the United States drive down the wages and benefits of U.S. workers by importing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of guest workers from other countries. An amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders would prohibit companies from hiring temporary guest workers if they recently laid-off or fired U.S. workers. Now, he wants a Labor Department investigation into job cuts at a Vermont ski resort.  
   The Rutland Herald first disclosed this week that Powdr Corp, the new owner of the Killington and Pico ski resorts, fired a significant number of full-time workers. Sanders asked Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to investigate. Killington Ltd., which recently sold the resort, had secured visas to bring in about 180 foreign athletic trainers, instructors, tow lift operators, snowmaker operators and housecleaners.
