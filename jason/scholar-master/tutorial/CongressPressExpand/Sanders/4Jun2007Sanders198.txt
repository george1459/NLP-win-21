NEW REPORT RANKS VERMONT NO. 1 IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICIES, PROGRAMS
  News in the campaign to reverse global warming comes this week in dispatches that carry datelines from Burlington, Vt. to Washington, D.C. to Heiligendamm, Germany. In Vermont, a new report ranks the state No. 1 in energy efficiency policies and programs. In Washington, the Senate prepares to take up an energy bill shaped by Sen. Bernie Sanders. And in Germany, climate change is expected to dominate a summit meeting of the world's leading industrial nations. Sanders signed a letter to President Bush before Air Force One took off for the Group of Eight meeting.
