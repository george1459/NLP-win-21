MONTPELIER TOWN HALL MEETING ON GLOBAL WARMING TO BE HELD JULY 8
  Sen. Bernie Sanders will host a town hall meeting on Sunday, July 8 in Montpelier featuring noted environmentalist and author Bill McKibben. Sanders is the lead sponsor of the strongest legislation in the Senate to reverse global warming. He also is playing an active role on related energy legislation that the Senate will resume considering when Congress reconvenes on Monday.  
   The Senate last Tuesday adopted a Sanders-Clinton Amendment that would train workers in new technologies associated with renewable energy projects. Sanders, according to Vermont Public Radio, "is playing a key role in the Senate's consideration of a comprehensive energy bill."
