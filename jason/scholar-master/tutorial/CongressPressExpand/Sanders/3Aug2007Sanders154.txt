SEN. SANDERS TO VISIT LYNDON, RUTLAND, BENNINGTON, SPRINGFIELD, ST. ALBANS TO DISCUSS JOBS, PUBLIC WORKS IN WEEK-LONG SERIES OF VERMONT LISTENING SESSIONS
  A week-long series of Vermont Listening Sessions will take Senator Bernie Sanders to Lyndon, Rutland, Bennington, Springfield and St. Albans to discuss jobs and public works. "I want to get a sense of what the needs are in towns throughout Vermont, especially towns that are the most economically hard pressed," he said. "We can do a better job creating good paying jobs if we have the infrastructure that the business community needs." 
   A member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sanders said the listening sessions are an opportunity for community leaders to focus on transportation needs and other public works priorities.
   Sanders will hear from local officials, regional planners, state legislators, state agency officials, labor and business leaders, as well as advocates for senior citizens and low-income individuals.
   "We are going to take a hard look and see what we need in terms of bridges and roads, what kind of water and sewer system problems exist, what we need in terms of public transportation, what we need in terms of broadband service and cell phone service, all of the components that when they come together create the environment that will allow for good paying jobs."
