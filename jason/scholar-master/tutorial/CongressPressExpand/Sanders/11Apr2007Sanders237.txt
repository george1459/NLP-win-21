END THE WAR: SEN. SANDERS COSPONSORS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY END U.S. MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ
  Sen. Bernie Sanders cosponsored legislation introduced this week that would effectively end U.S. military involvement in Iraq. The bill, introduced by Sen. Russ Feingold and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, would require the president to begin safely redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq in 120 days. "I strongly support the legislation to bring an end to U.S. involvement in the war in Iraq," Sanders said.  
   "Since President Bush has refused to recognize the reality of the situation in Iraq," Sanders added, "it is up to Congress to put and end to the war and bring our troops home. This legislation is an important step in that direction." A key provision in the bill would stop all funding for the war, with three narrow exceptions, effective March 31, 2008. "By setting a concrete timeline to stop funding for the war, this legislation sends a strong message to the president that he cannot simply continue to follow the same failed policies." 
   Other cosponsors are Senators Patrick Leahy, Barbara Boxer, Chris Dodd, Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and Sheldon Whitehouse. If the president vetoes an emergency supplemental spending bill, Reid has said he will work to ensure Feingold's bill gets a vote in the Senate before Memorial Day.
