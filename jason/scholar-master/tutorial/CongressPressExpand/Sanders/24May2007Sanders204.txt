SEN. SANDERS: NO BLANK CHECK ON IRAQ
  "The people of Vermont and the nation sent an absolutely unmistakable message last November. They want a change of policy in Iraq - they want the war to come to end and for American troops to be redeployed out of Iraq as soon as possible," Sen. Sanders said. 
   "Americans now view the war more negatively than at any time since the war began," according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll released Thursday. "Six in Ten Americans surveyed say the United States should have stayed out of Iraq, and more than three in four say that things are going badly there - including nearly half who say things are going very badly, the poll found," the Times added.
   Said Sanders, "President Bush continues to oppose the will of the American people by insisting on 'staying the course' in Iraq. Earlier this year I supported a funding bill that included a clear schedule for the redeployment. President Bush vetoed that bill and he continues to threaten to veto any bill that restricts his ability to carry out his failed Iraq policy. As a result, the bill that will be voted on tonight does not include any timeline for an end to the war in Iraq.
   "As someone who voted against giving the president the authority to go to war in Iraq, I have stated consistently that I cannot and will not support giving President Bush a blank check to carry on this disastrous war."
