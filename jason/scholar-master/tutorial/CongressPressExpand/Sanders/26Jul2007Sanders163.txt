SEN. SANDERS QUIZZES BUDGET NOMINEE
  President Bush's nominee to head the White House budget office testified at a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Budget Committee, questioned former Rep. Jim Nussle about tax breaks for the rich (Bush and Nussle are for them, Sanders and the majority of Americans are not). 
   The senator also cited troubling statistics about the number of Americans who have fallen into poverty since Bush took office. And he brought up the growing gap between the rich and the poor, a gap that is wider now than at any time since The Great Depression. 
   It is uncertain when the Senate will vote on Nussle, who was the House Budget Committee chairman between 2001 and 2006. Congressional Quarterly reported after the confirmation hearing that the next step in the confirmation process could turn on a meeting next week when President Bush and Democratic leaders of Congress are scheduled to discuss appropriations bills and Bush's threats to veto them.
