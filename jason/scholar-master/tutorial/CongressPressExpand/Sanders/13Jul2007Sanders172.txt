SEN. SANDERS APPEARS ON RADIO SHOW, AIR AMERICA
  Bernie appears every Friday on the Thom Hartmann Radio Show's "Brunch With Bernie" (http://thomhartmann.com). It's a great show and a great opportunity to hear Vermont's Independent Senator in action- discussing the important issues that the mainstream media rarely covers.  
   "The Thom Hartmann Show" (http://thomhartmann.com) is a nationally syndicated progressive talk show that can be found on Sirius and XM satellite radio, and dozens of other stations around the country. Thom Hartmann's on Air America's website.
