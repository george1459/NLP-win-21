MAYORS BACK SEN. SANDERS' ENERGY BILL TO REDUCE GLOBAL WARMING
  The United States Conference of Mayors applauded Sens. Bernie Sanders and Bob Menendez for introducing legislation to help cities improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
   Trenton, New Jersey Mayor Douglas H. Palmer, the conference president, said his organization worked closely with Sanders and Menendez on a proposal included in a bill by Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Jeff Bingaman. Their legislation would support efforts by cities to reduce energy consumption and curb carbon dioxide emissions. 
   "As former mayors, Senators Menendez and Sanders understand that a successful plan for reducing our energy use and greenhouse gases begins in cities and other communities all across the country," Mayor Palmer said. 
   More than 460 mayors have signed the Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels. "This new legislation is a giant step forward in bringing additional resources to bear on this monumental challenge before our nation and the planet," Palmer added. 
   The legislation would provide new federal funding directly to mayors, county executives and governors to support programs that improve community energy efficiency. 
   "This is the first time Congress has acted directly in response to the calls from mayors to support our local efforts on climate protection. This legislation marks the beginning of a broader national agenda of empowerment of local efforts to make our communities greener, healthier and more sustainable," said Mayor Palmer.
