THE ARCTIC IS SCREAMING
  The Arctic Ocean is melting. The volume of Arctic sea ice by the end of summer was half what it was just four years earlier, according to NASA satellite data obtained by The Associated Press. "The Arctic is screaming," Mark Serreze, senior scientist at the government's snow and ice data center, told the AP. Senator Bernie Sanders cited the report in a speech on the Senate floor about the importance of wind technology, one significant way to reduce reliance on coal, oil and other fossil fuels that produce the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Even former President George H. W. Bush has installed a windmill to provide electricity for the family compound near Kennebunkport, Maine. Meanwhile, negotiators for President George W. Bush at a United Nations conference on climate change in Bali are blocking progress. They have fought language in a final report that would establish the need for action within the next 15 years, and set emission reduction targets for developed countries. In a letter to the president, Sanders and other senators told President Bush "the world is watching" and urged him to direct U.S. negotiators to pursue policies "designed to propel further progress- not fuel additional delay"
