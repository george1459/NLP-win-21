SENATE ADVANCES IRAQ RESOLUTION
  In what could mark a turning point in the war in Iraq, the Senate today advanced a resolution setting a March 31, 2008 target date for the redeployment of United States forces.  
   "This war has been a disaster," Senator Bernie Sanders said. "I want to see our troops come home as soon as they can." 
   "In Vermont," Sanders added, "the war has taken an especially terrible toll." Vermont lives have been lost in Iraq in greater proportion than soldiers from any other state, according to a recent Associated Press analysis. "Families of soldiers redeployed are beginning to see this as a war we never should have been in the first place," Sanders said. 
   Overcoming Republican roadblocks to even debating the war, the Senate voted 89-9 to take up a measure that would call for a "comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy" for bringing stability to Iraq. It also would require President Bush to submit quarterly reports to Congress on a phased redeployment from Iraq. 
   The resolution would underscore a continued commitment to support and protect U.S. troops, but declare that circumstances have "changed substantially" since Congress in 2002 authorized the use of force and assert that the United States "should not be policing a civil war." 
   Sanders cautioned that Republicans stubbornly trying to shield President Bush from criticism still could use parliamentary maneuvers to block a final vote on the resolution.
