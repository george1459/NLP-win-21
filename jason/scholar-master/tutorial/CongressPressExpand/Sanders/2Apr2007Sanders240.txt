SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST BUSH ADMINISTRATION ON GLOBAL WARMING
  In a rebuke to Bush administration policies on global warming, the Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars.  
   Vermont and other states that mounted the legal challenge called global warming "the most pressing environmental challenge of our time." In a second case, the court unanimously vacated a lower court ruling for Duke Energy in a dispute over pollution permits. 
   "Even with its very conservative makeup, the Supreme Court sent a loud and clear message to the Bush administration that the EPA can no longer bury its head in the sand and ignore global warming," said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). "This is a one-two punch against the Bush administration and for the environment." 
   Sanders and Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, are sponsors of the most far-reaching legislation to combat global warming. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is a cosponsor of the bill. 
   The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act calls for a reduction of emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. 
   Former Vice President Al Gore, a leading figure in the fight against global warming, recently testified before Congress that the Sanders-Boxer bill is "an excellent piece of legislation."
