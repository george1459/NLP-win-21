SEN. SANDERS COMMENTS ON SENATE STIMULUS VOTE
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made the following statement tonight after Senate Republicans blocked an economic stimulus package that narrowly failed to get the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster. 
   "It is extremely disappointing that President Bush and most of the Senate Republicans are playing political games with our economy and the needs of the American people.  This economic stimulus package provides a tax rebate not only to working families and their kids, but to millions of seniors on Social Security and disabled veterans. It also increases funding for home heating assistance and other important programs.
   "I hope very much that within the next few days we can get one more Republican to support this vitally important legislation so that we will be able to pass it."
