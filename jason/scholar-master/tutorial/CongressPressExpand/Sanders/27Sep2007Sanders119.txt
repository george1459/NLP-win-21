SIGN PETITION AND TELL BUSH CHILDREN DESERVE HEALTH CARE
  Children's advocates on Thursday stepped up efforts to persuade President Bush to abandon his threat to veto legislation extending the Children's Health Insurance Program - or to round up enough votes in Congress to pass the bill over Bush's objection. "It is hard for me to begin to understand how this president can be threatening to veto this legislation," Senator Bernie Sanders said. "We hear a lot about family values. Well, if taking care of our children is not a family value then I don't know what is." You can help. Sign the online petition. Tell the president to sign the Children's Health Insurance Program bill. 
   The program covers about 6 million children who are low-income but not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The expansion would result in about 5.8 million additional children enrolling in Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid.
   In Vermont, the legislation would save health insurance for more than 2,000 Vermont children who would lose coverage under new rules announced by the Bush administration and cover more Vermont kids now without insurance. 
   "I find it ironic that the American people seem to get from the White House what they don't want, and they don't get what they do want," Sanders told colleagues in a Senate floor statement. "The American people want to end the war in Iraq as soon as possible, a war which will soon be costing us, if you can believe it, $750 billion?On the other hand, the American people do want health insurance for their children. The American people strongly support the Children's Health Insurance Program. That's what they want, but that's what they're not getting."
