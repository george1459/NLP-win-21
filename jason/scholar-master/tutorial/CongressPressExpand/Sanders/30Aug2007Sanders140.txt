SEN. SANDERS: BORDER BACKUPS
  Senator Bernie Sanders hosted meetings in Vermont Thursday on the economic and social impact of long lines and sometimes hours-long delays at checkpoints along the border of the United States and Canada. "People are very upset and it's causing tension between border community towns," Sanders told WCAX-TV. The senator invited a senior Homeland Security official - U.S. Customs and Border Protection Assistant Commissioner Thomas Winkowski - to see the situation firsthand at a town meeting in the Haskell Opera House. The historic building straddles the border at Derby Line, Vt., and Stanstead, Québec. "He's not just here to listen, but to come up with practical solutions to this problem," Sanders said.
