NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS
  Vermonters have a long history of serving their nation honorably in the armed services. An elite group of Vermont high school students just took a significant step towards joining that tradition. Last weekend, Senator Sanders congratulated the next generation of Vermont military leaders. The Senator nominated 21 Vermonters to attend the military service academies. "I am proud of the Vermonters I have nominated to the service academies, and they should be proud of their academic accomplishments and commitment to public service," Sanders said. Senator Sanders joined Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Peter Welch in congratulating the assembled nominees of each member of the congressional delegation. 
   A nomination by a public official is a major step in the highly-competitive admissions process for students interested in attending the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, and the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y. 
   Sanders said "I am confident that those students who are accepted at the academies and go on to serve their country will be outstanding representatives of Vermont."
   Vermont's congressional delegation greeted the young leaders Saturday, December 22 in the historic Cedar Creek Room of the Vermont State House in Montpelier.
