SEN. SANDERS COMMENTS ON WAR IN IRAQ
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said today, on the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq, that the United States must bring its troops home as soon as possible. 
   "More than five years ago, as a member of the House, I voted against giving President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq. The president did not make the case for going to war then. He has not made the case for remaining in Iraq since then, and he has failed to provide a plan to end the war.
   "Meanwhile, al Qaeda is stronger than at any time since September 11, and Osama bin Laden is still at large.
   "The misguided war in Iraq already has lasted longer than it took the United States and our allies to defeat Hitler in World War II. We have lost almost 4,000 soldiers. Thousands more have been wounded. The war also is costing the United States $12 billion a month, and there are estimates that the ultimate cost of the war will be more than $1 trillion. This war is putting us deeper and deeper in debt as we rebuild Iraq while we ignore the urgent need to rebuild our aging infrastructure and other unmet needs here at home.
   "Enough is enough. We must bring our troops home as soon as possible."
