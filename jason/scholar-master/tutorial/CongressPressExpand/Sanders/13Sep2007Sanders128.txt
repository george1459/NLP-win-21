SEN. SANDERS: WE NEED TROOPS TO DEVELOP NEW STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING SERIOUS PROBLEM OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM
  There has been good news from Washington, like well-deserved support in Congress for America's veterans and the biggest increase in grants and loans for college students since the GI Bill. And just this week, the Senate approved $7 million more for repairing Vermont bridges and passed a Sanders-Leahy Amendment that restored more than $181,000 for public housing authorities in Vermont. Those and other accomplishments have been overshadowed by all the bad news coming out of Iraq and a president bent on continuing the war he misled us into more than four years ago. "He is still misleading us," Senator Bernie Sanders said.  
   "Bush's 'troop withdrawal' will leave us with as many troops in Iraq as we had before the 'surge' troop buildup - about 130,000. Even more importantly, this president has no idea how to end this war. Bush's advisors concede that this war, already longer than WWII, could go on for another five to 10 years. This is unacceptable. We need to bring our troops home and develop a new and more effective strategy for fighting the very serious problem of international terrorism." Senator Sanders will discuss his views on the war and other topics when he is the guest on Vermont Public Radio's "Vermont Edition" at noon on Friday To participate in the program, you may email questions here or during the show call 1-800-639-2211.To listen live online visit at:
