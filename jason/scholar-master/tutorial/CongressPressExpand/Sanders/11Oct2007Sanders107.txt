HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 114 PASSED HOUSE ON OCT. 10
  House Joint Resolution 114 passed the House on October 10, 2002 by a vote of 296-to-133. It passed the Senate on October 11 by a vote of 77-to-23. It was signed into law by President Bush on October 16, 2002. The resolution required the president to employ diplomatic efforts at the United Nations Security Council to "obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions." It authorized the United States to use military force to "defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq." Bernie Sanders, then a member of the House, voted against the resolution. 
   Unfortunately, we all know the rest of the story.
