CONGRESSIONAL MANAGEMENT FOUNDATION HONORS SEN. SANDERS AS WINNERS ON THE WEB
  The Congressional Management Foundation today honored Senator Bernie Sanders for having one of the best Web sites in Congress. This site was commended in The 2007 Gold Mouse Report: Lessons from the Best Web Sites on Capitol Hill. The foundation analyzed 618 congressional Web sites, including those of all Senate and House Members, committees and official congressional leadership sites.  
   "One of the key reasons for the awards is to highlight best practices so offices can improve their sites by learning from those doing a good job," said Beverly Bell, the foundation's executive director.
    "Senator Sanders' Web site shows that he understands the value of creating a virtual office to reach specific audiences who have come to expect having their needs met online," she added. "We congratulate Senator Sanders for having a Web site that is among the best-of-the-best on Capitol Hill."
   Regular readers of this site know it is updated daily with news and information about issues like the economy, education, the environment, health care and other top priorities for Senator Sanders. Visitors can find out about constituent services, learn more about legislation by Sanders and others, send the senator a message, track roll call votes as they happen, watch the senator's floor speeches and see what happens in committee hearings.
   Vermont, by the way, is the only state where the entire congressional delegation was honored for hosting award-winning Web sites. Congratulations to the cyber senator and to Congressman Welch.
