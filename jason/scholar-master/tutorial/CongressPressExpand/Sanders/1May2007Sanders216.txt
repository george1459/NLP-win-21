SEN. SANDERS CALLS BUSH VETO ON IRAQ 'GRAVE ERROR'
  Congress formally sent President Bush a bill setting a timeline for withdrawing American troops from Iraq that Bush vowed to veto.  
   "President Bush is making a grave error in vetoing this legislation," Senator Bernie Sanders said. 
   "The people of America have made it very clear that they want our government to move in a very different direction, and all Bush is doing is escalating and increasing mistakes he has made over the past four years," Sanders added. 
   The death toll for the multinational coalition last month stood at 117, making April the deadliest month of combat casualties in more than two years. 
   "I find it incredible that Bush would veto the supplemental spending bill, which calls for a timeline of troop withdrawal, at exactly the same time when more coalition troops were lost in one month in Iraq than in any month for two years," Sanders said. 
   Sanders also noted a new report by the U.S. State Department that said terrorist attacks mounted in the past year. 
   Terrorist attacks against noncombatants nearly doubled in Iraq and rose sharply in Afghanistan. Worldwide, there was a 29 percent increase in terrorism worldwide, according to a report released Monday by the State Department, but terrorist attacks rose 91 percent in Iraq and 53 percent in Afghanistan, according to the report posted Monday on the State Department's Web site. 
   "The idea of continuing down a path which results in more and more deaths in Iraq and more and more terrorism makes no sense at all," Sanders said. "We need to bring our troops home as soon as possible, and develop a new approach to combating international terrorism." 
   The $124.2 billion funding bill would require troops to begin leaving Iraq in October. It sets a goal of full withdrawal by spring of 2008.
