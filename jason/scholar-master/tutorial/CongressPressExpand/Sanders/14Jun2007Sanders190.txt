HEAD START PROGRAMS SERVING ABOUT 1,400 CHILDREN, THEIR FAMILIES IN VERMONT
  Head Start, the early childhood development program, has been a success story since it was created in 1965. It provides nutrition services and helps develop reading and math skills for children up to three years old. Legislation that would reauthorize Head Start for the first time in almost a decade is moving through Congress. Sen. Bernie Sanders is a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has approved a bill that would authorize $7.3 billion for next year and more in the future. The amount would have been much less without prodding by Sanders in committee.  
   In Vermont, there are seven Head Start programs serving about 1,400 children and their families. More children are eligible. More children could be served with the adequate funding. "We are working very hard to make sure Head Start is available all over this country and in Vermont for people who are eligible," Sanders said.
