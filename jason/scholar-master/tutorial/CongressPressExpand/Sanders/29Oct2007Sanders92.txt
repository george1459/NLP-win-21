SEN. SANDERS BRINGS TOP U.S. FIRE OFFICIAL TO VERMONT
  "There wasn't a hint of smoke, but that didn't stop more than 100 firefighters from dozens of departments from responding to Randolph Union High School on Saturday morning," the Rutland Herald reported. "Though nothing was burning when they arrived at 9:30, the firefighters themselves were "fully involved" during a two-hour "town meeting" organized by Sen. Bernie Sanders and attended by the nation's highest-ranking fire official. Vermont firefighters from Ascutney to Worcester took full advantage of the opportunity to bend Sanders' ear, while picking the brain of U.S. Fire Administrator Greg Cade."
