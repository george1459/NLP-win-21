SEN. SANDERS TO PRESENT MEDALS TO WORLD WAR II VETERAN SABENS
  This Veterans Day, Vermonters are serving in the military in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world. When they come home to Alburg, Guilford, Canaan, Pownal or anywhere in between, it is our responsibility to help their return to civilian life and provide the health care they were promised. As we honor this generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, we also remember sacrifices by earlier generations. In a special Veterans Day observance, Senator Sanders is presenting medals to World War II veteran Stanley Sabens of Barre.  
   Mr. Sabens, 83, enlisted in the Army in 1943 and was discharged in 1945, two months after the Japanese surrender ended the global conflict that was the deadliest in human history. 
   He had fought in southern France and the Rhineland campaign on the Franco-Italian border with the 1st Special Service Force, the renowned joint American-Canadian commando unit known as the Devil's Brigade. Senator Sanders helped secure replacements for medals he earned, including the Bronze Star, Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two bronze service stars, a World War II Victory Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Honorable Service Lapel Button and Sharpshooter Badge with Carbine Bar and a Rifle Bar. 
   Mr. Sabens is a Vermont institution in another way. He and his wife opened the Knoll Motel in Barre in 1950, the first motel in Vermont. Senator Leahy recognized the Knoll Motel in the Congressional Record in 2001 in honor of the motel's 50th Anniversary.
   Senator Sanders continues to be a leader on veterans' issues. You can read more about what the senator has done for veterans: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/index.cfm?code=Veterans&pheader=VETERANS.
