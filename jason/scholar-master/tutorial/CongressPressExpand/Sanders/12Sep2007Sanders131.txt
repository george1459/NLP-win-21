SEN. SANDERS APPLAUDS COURT RULING AGAINST AUTOMAKERS ON EMISSIONS
  A federal judge in Vermont ruled today that Vermont and other states can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. U.S. District Court Judge William Sessions III rejected automaker claims that federal law preempts state rules. 
   "At a time of growing concern about air pollution and global warming, it is tragic that the American automobile industry made a federal case out of its wrongheaded attempt to avoid responsibility for helping to clean up the problem it created," said Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
   "I hope this court ruling is upheld so states like Vermont and California can take the strong measures necessary to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Sanders added. "The Bush administration must stop siding with polluters and at least get out of the way of states that want to help the environment."
   Before the tough California standards can take effect, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must grant a waiver the state has sought under the federal Clean Air Act.
