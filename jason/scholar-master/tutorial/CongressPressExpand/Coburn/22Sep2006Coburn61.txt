Individuals and Will Help Break the Chain of Infection  September 22  2006 More Than One Million People in the U S  are Currently Infected with HIV  About Half Do Not Consistently Receive Medical Care  and One Quarter of the Total Do Not Even Know They Are Infected    WASHINGTON D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  and AIDS Healthcare Foundation  AHF  the nations largest provider of HIV AIDS medical care serving thousands of patients  will host a press conference to announce support for new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  guidelines for HIV AIDS prevention and testing strategies  The new guidelines encourage U S  medical providers to make HIV testing a routine part of care in doctors  offices and clinics for all patients ages 13 through 64  The guidelines encourage linkages to care and treatment for those found to be HIV infected  and also suggest that   HIV     screening should be routine  regardless of whether the patient is known or suspected to have specific behavioral risks for HIV infection     CDCs recommendation that HIV testing become a part of routine medical care will greatly enhance our ability to control the spread of this disease and improve the lives of those living with it  said Dr  Coburn  a practicing physician who has treated patients with HIV for over twenty years  According to the CDC  one fourth of the over one million Americans living with HIV do not know that they are infected  On average  it takes 10 years for HIV infection to progress to AIDS  Yet as many as 45 percent of persons testing positive for HIV received their first positive test result less than a year before AIDS was diagnosed  40 000 Americans have become newly diagnosed with HIV every year for well over a decade  and about one half of those living with HIV are not receiving regular medical treatment  These numbers demonstrate the failure of the current policies that deter early diagnosis and why routine testing and access to treatment are essential if we wish to win the war against HIV    We are pleased to see the CDC proposing further normalization of HIV testing  and strongly believe these new guidelines must tie testing to access to medical care for those individuals found to be HIV positive  said Michael Weinstein  AIDS Healthcare Foundation President  Increasingly  HIV AIDS is a disease that affects minorities  with African American women representing the fastest growing proportion of new cases  The largest number of undiagnosed individuals is believed to be among minority populations  communities that frequently wait longer to seek care and treatment and often access such care on an emergency basis  These new CDC HIV testing guidelines will help us address some of these disparities of care by prioritizing early diagnosis and expanding access to primary medical care and treatment for those found to be HIV positive  These new guidelines will also help us better target federal resources to communities where the epidemic is growing to ensure that our focus remains on where the disease is today and where it is headed     AIDS Healthcare Foundation currently operates the largest alternative HIV testing program in California conducting more than 15 000 HIV tests in community based settings in Southern California including three of AHFs Out of the Closet thrift stores in Los Angeles  through a testing program in the countys jail system  and a mobile unit which travels throughout the Los Angeles area providing free HIV and STD testing     AHF spearheaded several pioneering grassroots HIV testing programs in California which now provide more than 15 000 free HIV tests annually  added AHFs Weinstein  We have also seen the success of more widespread and routine HIV testing in Uganda  where AHF currently operates 18 free AIDS treatment clinics  In addition  there is a growing emphasis on providing routine HIV testing both globally and domestically  the Ryan White CARE Act includes provisions for routine HIV testing  and President Clinton and global health leaders have recently stepped up the call for HIV testing to be included as a part of providing routine health care worldwide     In addition  the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency Act  RWCA   the federal law that provides the principal source of funding for AIDS care and services nationwide  includes provisions for  30 million in grants to support and promote early diagnosis efforts  The new Early Diagnosis Grants included in RWCA will provide  20 million to states with laws requiring routine HIV testing of pregnant women and universal testing of newborns  and  10 million to states that provide routine testing for clients at STD clinics and substance abuse treatment centers     The CARE Act was first introduced in 1990 and is reauthorized every five years  The bill was set for reauthorization in September 2005  but Congress has yet to take action on it  It is now expected Congress will re authorize the bill by September 30   Related Resources       57 0 KBs  Sep 22  2006
