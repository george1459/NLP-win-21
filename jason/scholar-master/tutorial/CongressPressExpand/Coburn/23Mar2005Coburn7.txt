          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      March 23  2005  WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today responded to the release of the 2005 Social Security and Medicare Trustees    Report  This year   s report estimates that Social Security will run annual cash deficits in 2017 while Medicare   s cost will exceed revenues in 2012     The true picture of our government   s finances is not what politicians and experts in Washington  D C  say it is     it is much worse  Previous generations of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny  the next generation will have a rendezvous with bankruptcy  Our children and grandchildren will pay a heavy price if we continue to delay reform and downplay the scope of our fiscal challenge  Under the most optimistic forecasts we are on an unsustainable course  Even with a strong economy  this is not a problem we can grow our way out of     Dr  Coburn said     The trust fund concept is a fraud that creates the illusion of stability     Dr  Coburn added     The Social Security and Medicare trust funds contain no real dollars  By 2017 and 2012  respectively  Congress will be forced to borrow cash  cut other government programs or raise taxes to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits     Dr  Coburn explained that it would take roughly  70 000 per person to permanently cover the unfunded liability of Social Security alone  The cost of doing nothing to fix Social Security is now  700 billion per year  which adds an additional debt of  4 400 per person each year on top of the current  70 000 liability     Congress    inability to restrain domestic spending and its appetite for politically desirable but unnecessary projects has made this challenge much worse  Congress can address the challenges presented in this report by at least keeping the rate of growth in government spending below the rate of inflation  and by using responsible budget practices  When Congress returns from Easter recess to consider a supplemental spending bill we should keep this report in mind as we decide what spending programs we should label as    emergency    spending     Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 488 546 410 160 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
