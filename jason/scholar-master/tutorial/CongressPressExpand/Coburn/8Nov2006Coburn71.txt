          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Says election shows    total failure of big government Republicanism    and a hunger for    honor and dignity    in Congress November 8  2006     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement tonight regarding the outcome of the mid term elections     Although this election represents a short term setback for Republicans  it could be an important turning point for the Republican Party and  more importantly  the country  Every incumbent was reminded that the American people  not party establishments  hold the reins of government  Throughout our history  when the American people rise up and force change our country benefits  In our system  the wisdom of many individual voters still outweighs the wisdom of a few  Dr  Coburn said     Many factors contributed to these election results  The American people obviously are concerned about the conduct of the war in Iraq  Members of both parties have an obligation to work together to offer creative and constructive solutions that will help our troops accomplish their mission     The overriding theme of this election  however  is that voters are more interested in changing the culture in Washington than changing course in Washington  D C  This election was not a rejection of conservative principles per se  but a rejection of corrupt  complacent and incompetent government     A recent CNN poll found that 54 percent of Americans believe government is doing too much while only 37 percent want government to do more  The results of this election reflect that attitude  Among the Republicans who lost their re election bids a surprising number were political moderates who advocated a more activist government  Several Republican members of the appropriations committees  which have been on a spending binge  also were not re elected  On the other hand  the two Republican senators who pulled off the most impressive victories were unapologetic conservatives  Jon Kyl  R AZ  and John Ensign  R NV   It is also notable that the Democrats who won or who ran competitive races sounded more like Ronald Reagan than Lyndon Johnson     This election does not show that voters have abandoned their belief in limited government  it shows that the Republican Party has abandoned them  In fact  these results represent the total failure of big government Republicanism     The Republican Party now has an opportunity to rediscover its identity as a party for limited government  free enterprise and individual responsibility  Most Americans still believe in these ideals  which reflect not merely the spirit of 1994 or the Reagan Revolution  but the vision of our founders  If Republicans present real ideas and solutions based on these principles we will do well in the future     What Republicans cannot continue to do  however  is more of the same  Our short term  politically expedient  bread and circus governing philosophy has failed  Iraq is an important issue in the minds of voters but it is not the only issue  Our majority was severely weakened by a long series of decisions that pre date the publics current concern about Iraq     Republicans oversaw a seven fold increase in pork projects since 1998  Republicans increased domestic spending by nearly 50 percent since 2001  increased the national debt to  9 trillion  passed a reckless Medicare expansion bill and neglected our oversight responsibilities  While some of these decisions may have helped secure specific seats in the short term the totality of our excess did not secure our majority  but destroy it     There should now be less doubt about whether overspending and pork projects are bad policy and bad politics  This year  in particular  pork did not save our vulnerable incumbents but helped drag them down  The challenges facing our country are too great and complex for members of Congress and their staff to continue to be distracted by endless earmarking     Some have said that Republicans and Democrats now need to govern from the middle  I disagree  We do not need to govern from the center as much as we need to govern from conscience  When politicians have the courage to argue their convictions and lose their political lives in an honest battle of ideas the best policies will prevail     The American people do want civility but they also want real debate  Civility does not mean an absence of conflict  but a return of honor and dignity in our politics  The great debates in American history like the Lincoln Douglas debates or the debates about the Constitution were intensely confrontational  but no one feels soiled after reading them  That same quality of debate is possible today if politicians put their country first and party second  The problems facing our country are too great to not have these debates  Voters are bored and tired of partisan role playing in Washington  The answers to securing Iraq  winning the War on Terror  and preventing the impending bankruptcies of Medicare and Social Security will not be discovered by portraying the other party as the focus of evil and corruption  If we dont debate these issues with honor and agree on solutions we will be the first generation of leaders that left the next generation worse off  and we will see our relative power in the world diminish    One of the great paradoxes in politics is that governing to maintain power is the surest way to lose it  Republicans have the ideas to solve our greatest challenges  If we focus on ideas  our majority status will take care of itself  Dr  Coburn said
