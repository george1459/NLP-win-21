Like many Americans  I have been encouraged by the Presidents recent calls for Congress to not only reform the earmark process  but to reduce the total number and cost of earmarks  Making the earmark process more transparent and accountable is important  but the best reform is to reduce the number and cost of earmarks  In recent decades earmarks have become a cancer on the federal budget and the legislative process  While any earmark reduction is helpful  we need to pursue bolder measures  No physician  for instance  would stop at reducing a patients cancer by 50 percent  As Congress considers earmark reform legislation in the coming weeks  Im convinced that the Presidents ongoing leadership in this area will be critical to ensuring that Congress produces something beyond token reform     The pledge made by the Chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees  Representative David Obey  D WI  and Senator Robert Byrd  D WV   respectively  to place a moratorium on all earmarks until a reformed process is put in place represents a welcome  but ambiguous and incomplete  commitment to reform  While I intend to do everything in my power to help my colleagues  whether Republican or Democrat  pass meaningful earmark reform  history suggests that Congress will pass just enough reform to claim it has achieved a reformed process before returning to the business as usual practices that voters rejected in November     The institutional and political factors that led to an explosion of earmarks and the phenomenon of the earmark favor factory and its related scandals were not unique to either party  and neither party in Congress has the capability and credibility to reform the earmark process without genuine bipartisan cooperation and the active involvement of the executive branch  I would therefore encourage the administration to consider the following measures that will both encourage Congress to pass meaningful earmark reform and advance the Presidents goal of cutting the number and cost of earmarks    1  In light of the current earmark moratorium  immediately direct agencies to cancel nonessential earmarks that were appropriated in previous years but receive recurring funding   2  Exercise the Presidents virtual line item veto authority by directing agencies to ignore non binding earmarks  like those that appear in committee report language or joint explanatory statements   3  Direct agency officials to not implement backdoor earmark requests that are delivered by telephone or other indirect means and to create a public record of those requests   4  Pledge to veto any earmark reform legislation that is weaker than the package passed by the House  which contains minimal but essential reforms    As you know very well  windows of opportunity to pass meaningful reform in Washington do not stay open indefinitely  I would urge the administration to be active  constructive and  when necessary  aggressive  participants in this process  What is at stake is not merely Congress reputation but our ability to put the federal government back on a sustainable fiscal course  For the past 20 years  earmarks have been the gateway to spending addiction in Congress  Earmarks have been extremely costly in their own right but the earmark process itself has kept government bigger and taxes higher than they might be otherwise  The earmark process has also been a debilitating distraction necessary for members and their staff  At a time when we are combating international terrorism and facing entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security that are on the verge of bankruptcy  it is unconscionable for members to devote so much of their energy to activities that are often better left to local government or private entities     Thank you again for your commitment to serious earmark reform and spending reduction  I look forward to working with you to turn these priorities into accomplishments     Sincerely     Tom A  Coburn  M D    United States Senator
