Washington  D C   can honor our service men and women by incorporating that spirit of service and sacrifice in our day to day decisions  Our heritage is in jeopardy because too many politicians refuse to make the tough decisions necessary to put us back on a sustainable fiscal path  As long as politicians ask our soldiers to risk their lives in defense in freedom the very least we can do is risk our political lives for the same goal  President Reagan summed it up best in his speech in Pointe du Hoc on the commeration of the 40th anniversary of the Normandy invasion    REMARKS BY PRESIDENT REAGAN AT A CEREMONY COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSAY OF THE NORMANDY INVASION June 6  1984 We re here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty  For four long years  much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow  Free nations had fallen  Jews cried out in the camps    millions cried out for liberation  Europe was enslaved  and the world prayed for its rescue  Here in Normandy the rescue began  Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history  We stand on a lonely  windswept point on the northern shore of France  The air is soft  but forty years ago at this moment  the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men  and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon  At dawn  on the morning of the 6th of June  1944  225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs  Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion  to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns  The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here  and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance  The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers    at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades  And the American Rangers began to climb  They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up  When one Ranger fell  another would take his place  When one rope was cut  a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again  They climbed  shot back  and held their footing  Soon  one by one  the Rangers pulled themselves over the top  and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs  they began to seize back the continent of Europe  Two hundred and twenty five came here  After two days of fighting  only 90 could still bear arms  Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs  And before me are the men who put them there  These are the boys of Pointe de Hoc  These are the men who took the cliffs  These are the champions who helped free a continent  These are the heroes who helped end a war  Gentlemen  I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender s poem  You are men who in your lives fought for life   and left the vivid air signed with your honor     Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here  You were young the day you took these cliffs  some of you were hardly more than boys  with the deepest joys of life before you  Yet you risked everything here  Why  Why did you do it  What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs  What inspired all the men of the armies that met here  We look at you  and somehow we know the answer  It was faith  and belief  it was loyalty and love  The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right  faith that they fought for all humanity  faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next  It was the deep knowledge    and pray God we have not lost it    that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest  You were here to liberate  not to conquer  and so you and those others did not doubt your cause  And you were right not to doubt  You all knew that some things are worth dying for  One s country is worth dying for  and democracy is worth dying for  because it s the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man  All of you loved liberty  All of you were willing to fight tyranny  and you knew the people of your countries were behind you
