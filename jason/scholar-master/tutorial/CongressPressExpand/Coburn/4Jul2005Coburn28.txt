          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      July 4  2005  As Oklahomans prepare to celebrate July 4th  many families have loved ones serving overseas who need our prayers and support  Our mission in Iraq  in particular  is at the forefront of our hearts and minds   As I was putting my thoughts together about the need to support our military in advance of July 4th I came across a moving and eloquent letter from a young Oklahoman serving in Iraq than is more profound that anything I could say    To Whom It May Concern    My name is Jesse Young  I was born and raised in Tulsa  graduated from Booker T  Washington High School  attend the University of Oklahoma in Norman  and am currently serving my country as a soldier in the US Army outside of Baghdad  Iraq  I am writing this letter  to you  the American public  during what I feel to be a crucial point in this nation   s War on Terror         Naturally  I cannot currently watch the nightly news in America from my station half the world away  but I am still able to follow politics and current events through the internet  and frankly  what I hear  see  and read scares me     I am not writing this letter on a political front  and therefore will not begin to proselytize my political leanings during this letter  I will leave that to the politicians battling it out on Capitol Hill  I am writing on behalf of my brothers and sisters in arms  as these are the men and women I serve with daily  and whose work directs me most directly         We are battling a foe who knows no leniency       These    freedom fighters    walk into cafes in Baghdad filled with innocent civilians   including women and children   and detonate themselves with suicide vests  killing dozens       My real purpose in writing this letter  however  is not to persuade or dissuade anyone   s belief or support of this war       I am truly writing this letter as a plea  on behalf of all service members  to the people most important to us  the American public    Whether or not we agree with this war  we are fighting it  We are putting our lives on the line twenty four hours a day  We do a job daily that most at home wouldn   t consider  We put our lives in line for a nation that   s never known freedom  for people we   ve never met    In a war that no one can truly see the end of  the support of all Americans becomes increasingly important  and weighs increasingly heavy on the shoulders of the Americans here fighting it     Please don   t forget  that while you are at home sleeping in your beds  there are many over here who would love to do the same  Just as you need support  backing  and love from your families and friends in your life  we too need it in ours  The only difference for us is  our family is all Americans      As the 4th of July is approaching  let us not forget those from our community who are currently making the sacrifice so that all others can sleep in their beds at home       Sincerely Jesse S YoungSpecialistUnited States ArmyOklahoma National Guard Thunderbirds   I believe that all Americans can be very proud of not only our soldiers like Jesse Young  but our overall mission in Iraq  In Iraq  we overthrew a genocidal dictator  freed an entire nation from tyranny and made the world more secure  Iraq is not the front line between America and the Islamic or Arab world  it is the front line between freedom and the tyranny of violent Islamic extremism  We have two choices in Iraq  We can turn tail and run and wait for another 9 11 type attack or we can win and change the future for the Middle East and for future generations of Americans    Make no mistake  the battle to defeat terrorism will be long and arduous but we cannot lose our resolve  I know families miss their soldiers  especially during this holiday in which we celebrate our freedom  But calling for a timetable for withdrawal would only emboldened the terrorists and strengthen their will to wait us out   On Independence Day we celebrate our Nation   s victory over tyranny and oppression  but those dark forces are again trying to take root in a fledgling nation and will take root in any nation that chooses appeasement  Like our founding fathers  our brave men and women in uniform again have taken up the fight to protect freedom and  with the American people   s support  we will succeed
