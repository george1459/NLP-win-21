          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      November 15  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement today regarding the Senates attempt to pass a complex and critical mortgage reform bill without the opportunity for debate or amendment   This bill will exacerbate problems in the mortgage industry by making it easier for big banks to exploit potential homeowners who cant afford the loans for which they are applying  The solution to the mortgage crisis is fewer risky loans  not more  Dr  Coburn said     It is nave  irresponsible and reckless for the Senate to claim it can fix this national challenge by blowing a bill through the chamber without debate and without the opportunity to improve the bill through amendments  This bill was reported out of committee only two days ago and has been read by only a handful of staff and very few elected Senators  Dr  Coburn said     The Senates growing tendency to pass critical bills without debate and without a roll call vote is disgraceful  Dr  Coburn added  One reason we have an 11 percent approval rating is that we are neglecting our basic duties to read and debate the bills we consider  Between January and August of this year  only 29 of the 399 bills the Senate passed  7 percent  were subjected to a roll call vote  This track record is beneath the dignity of the worlds greatest deliberative body     While some Senators will claim passing this bill is an urgent priority  it is important to note that if Senators spent less time earmarking funds for special interest projects like Teapot Museums and First Lady Libraries we would have more time to devote to addressing the real problems we see in the mortgage industry  Dr  Coburn said     Congress can relieve borrowers and homeowners by reducing the amount of money we borrow from them every day to pay for wasteful Washington spending  Families across America dont have the luxury of loaning themselves any money when theyve maxed out their credit  Yet  thats what Congress did this past September when it increased the federal debt limit by nearly 10 percent  or  850 billion  from  8 965 trillion to  9 815 trillion  Dr  Coburn said     Congress can take steps to reform the mortgage industry  Yet  our most important role in this area of our economy is keeping more money in the hands of potential homeowners and less money in the hands of politicians who continue to spend and borrow far beyond our means  Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         9 488 543 481 000 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
