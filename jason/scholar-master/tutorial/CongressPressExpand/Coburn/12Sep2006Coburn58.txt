          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      September 12  2006     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  today released the responses his subcommittee has received so far to a July 27  2006 letter regarding the effectiveness of higher education earmarks  Of the 113 colleges and universities that received a letter  60 have responded with complete or partial answers  10 have indicated that they are making a good faith effort to comply and 38 have provided no response whatsoever  Dr  Coburn extended the September 1  2006 deadline for responses in order to accommodate late responders     In a time of war and mounting fiscal challenges  taxpayers have a right to know how their money is spent  In these difficult times  Congress  in particular  has a responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight of all areas of the federal budget  which is why my subcommittee has held 45 oversight hearings since 2005  The letter I sent to colleges and universities is an important aspect of a broader effort to bring greater transparency and accountability to all areas of the federal budget  Dr  Coburn said     I appreciate the time and attention 60 colleges and universities devoted to responding to this inquiry and I look forward to receiving additional responses from colleges and universities who are working diligently on an answer     However  I am dismayed that 38 institutions of higher learning in our country have not made a good faith effort to reply to this simple request for information  Failing to provide any response whatsoever to this letter is not merely an affront to Congress  and our constitutional duty to oversee federal spending  but to every American taxpayer who finances earmarks     Ignoring this letter is also deeply insulting to students and their families who are being asked to finance skyrocketing tuition costs and burdensome loan repayment schedules  American families are struggling more and more to be able to afford ever increasing higher education costs  It is indefensible for institutions of higher learning to demand more and more money from the public through tuition and tax dollars while keeping the public in the dark about how they spend public funds  The least a college or university can do that has benefited from thousands or millions of dollars in earmarked funds is to provide the public a clear accounting of how those funds were used  Dr  Coburn said     College tuition more than doubled between 19861987 and 20022003  rising from  5 206 to  12 111  according to the Heritage Foundation  At the same time  cost concerns were a significant reason why 250 000 qualified high school graduates did not pursue higher education in 2003  according to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education  Approximately 70 percent of Americans believe that higher education is being priced beyond the income of the average family  Source  The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education  May 2002      I look forward to holding hearings on college and university earmarks either this fall or next year in the Federal Financial Management subcommittee  particularly since Congress has not conducted substantive oversight in this area for nearly 15 years  If colleges and universities who have not responded do not respond to this request promptly they may have an opportunity to explain their lack of a response to my subcommittee in a public hearing  If universities do not have this data  or cannot provide it to Congress in a timely fashion  that may reflect a serious management problem within universities which also should be addressed     American taxpayers have been generous supporters of higher education and they have a right to know whether federal research dollars should be allocated on the basis of merit or political considerations  The fact is  while members of Congress may have good intentions  they are not equipped to conduct an objective peer review process among competing scientific requests  In the long term  higher education earmarking may seriously erode our nations research edge and ability to compete in a global economy by putting politics ahead of sound science  Dr  Coburn said     for updates on Dr  Coburns oversight work and a complete list of
