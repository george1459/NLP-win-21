          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Says holds unjustified as senators use health care funds to finance frivolous pork spending and lavish AIDS conferences September 28  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   a practicing physician who has treated patients with HIV AIDS  today urged his colleagues to end their obstruction of a bill to renew and update the Ryan White CARE Act  which is the federal governments largest HIV AIDS specific care program     Congress should put the lives of all those living with HIV ahead of petty parochial and political interests and pass the CARE Act reauthorization  It is immoral for senators to defend an imbalanced and outdated funding formula that renders those in the South and rural areas as having a fraction of the worth of those living elsewhere  The status quo being defended by a handful of senators literally provides federal funds for dead AIDS patients in San Francisco while shortchanging other areas where patients are dying on waiting lists for AIDS medications  Denying Americans access to these life saving drugs is nothing short of handing them an early death sentence  Dr  Coburn said     We should all share the goal of ensuring that every American living with HIV has access to the same lifesaving medication  Unfortunately a pork barrel mentality has pervaded this process with senators more interested in getting the biggest piece of the pie rather than serving those most in need     The same senators who are blocking this bill in a money grab for their states have siphoned off our nations scarce health care dollars to finance their own pork barrel spending projects in other bills at the expense of those most in need  I cant imagine that any American in New York would object to liquidating  500 000 for the Virtual Herbarium the states Senate delegation secured if those dollars could save lives in other states  Senators are elected to make hard choices and the notion that earmarks are vital is not connected to any reality outside of Washington  D C   Dr  Coburn said     The Senate appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 that funds the Departments of Labor  Health and Human Services  through which the CARE Act is funded  is stuffed with  1 billion in earmarks      The patients with HIV who are being underserved under the current formula are disproportionately minority women in the South  While these patients go without life saving treatment  New York has the luxury of funding herbariums and providing lavish services for those living with HIV AIDS  Dr  Coburn said     Some facts about New York    In 2006 the national average funding per AIDS case was  1 613  New Yorks average was  2 122 per case  nearly 33 percent more per case than the national average  Under the corrected funding formulas  the national average in 2007 would be  1 793  and New Yorks would still be a significantly higher  2 107  just 5 percent less than the state currently receives   In 2000 2003  New York carried over an average of  29 million a year in Title I and Title II funds  If New York can afford to carry a surplus of  29 million in those years  how can it justify holding up life saving legislation over a  2 1 million per year funding adjustment  The New York Times reported that New York was paying for dog walking and candlelight dinners with AIDS funds while other areas of the country do not have sufficient funds to pay for medications for those living with HIV  The New York Post reported that the city was putting up homeless AIDS patients in glitzy four star hotels   If senators are unwilling to accept simple fairness that gives the same value to each American with HIV  I would recommend a simple ten percent across the board cut in earmark funding within the Labor HHS education bill with the  100 million in savings being reallocated for Ryan White CARE Act programs  This will guarantee that the states represented by the senators blocking the reauthorization will not experience any reductions in funding  ensure that those in need of care and treatment are taken care of  and clear the path for swift reauthorization  Dr  Coburn said     Congress can also do a better job prioritizing the money we spend on AIDS programs  Dr  Coburn added  The U S  federal government spends more than  21 billion on HIV AIDS annually  yet up to 59 percent of Americans with HIV are not in regular care  HHS has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on four AIDS conferences in the last six weeks  Just this past weekend  HHS helped fund an AIDS conference in sunny Hollywood  Florida where attendees enjoyed beach parties  including the official Latin Fiesta and a Sizzling Fashion Show  and stayed at a luxurious ocean front resort

                                                                                                                9 488 545 913 400 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
