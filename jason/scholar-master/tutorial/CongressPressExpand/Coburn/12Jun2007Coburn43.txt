R OK   a practicing physician  today released an   CDC   an agency with a  10 billion annual budget and a crucial public health mission     Recent events have highlighted how critical CDCs mission is to the health of our nation  The American public  now more than ever  expects CDC to spend its funds preventing diseases and dealing with public safety threats  including the threat of bioterrorism  While CDC is meeting some of those expectations  it also wastes millions of dollars  said Dr  Coburn  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  Government Information and International Security  FFM      In a detailed oversight report  the first in a series that will examine the operations of federal agencies  a U S  Senate Subcommittee highlights how the CDC has wasted and continues to waste hundreds of millions of tax dollars  but keeps asking taxpayers for more     In   A review of how an agency tasked with fighting and preventing disease has spent hundreds of millions of tax dollars for failed prevention efforts  international junkets  and lavish facilities  but cannot demonstrate it is controlling disease  the minority staff of the FFM subcommittee examines how CDC has tilted off center and makes recommendations about how it might get back on track    Dr  Coburn noted  Recently  it was reported that the CDC director told Congress the agency needs an additional  1 billion in 2008 to do its job properly  The FFM oversight report shows the director where she might begin looking for those funds internally  before she asks taxpayers to open their wallets even wider     CDC employs many honest  hard working people who shoulder a very important mission for our nation  Yet  like most agencies  it offers many examples of how an agency with a large budget can veer off track in prioritizing its funds     A sample of what is included in this new oversight report    CDC spent  1 7 million  including funds from a terrorism account  on a Hollywood liaison program  which happens to be run by a former CDC employee  see page 87    CDC paid to create a statue of a woman made out of vegetables  who was featured in its  106 million new communications and visitor center  recently named after the senator in charge of funding CDC   see page 11    The Thomas R  Harkin visitor center also includes a giant 70 foot wide by 25 foot tall video wall of plasma screen TVs to showcase vignettes about the agency  The plasma TVs are part of the buildings  5 1 million audio visual integration expenditures  see page 8    CDC spent  30 000 on saunas for its new  200 000 fitness center  a center which also includes mood enhancing lightshows and two  1 750 zero gravity chairs  see page 15    CDC syphilis prevention funds were spent to host a safe sex event with a porn star  during a time when rates of the disease among men climbed by 68 percent  see page 44    CDC HIV AIDS prevention funds were spent on a transgender beauty pageant  see page 45    CDC spent  45 million for conferences  including those featuring prostitutes  protests  and beach parties  see pages 50  52 53   55    CDC sent 110 employees to two international AIDS conferences  20 to Thailand and 90 to Barcelona   when purchasing retroviral drugs with the trip funds likely could have prevented mother to child AIDS transmission for more than 115 000 infants around the world  see pages 52  54    CDC is opening a Hawaii office  a development announced by a senator from Hawaii who oversees its funding  see page 18    CDC has spent  5 billion over seven years on HIV AIDS prevention funding  and yet the United States still sees 40 000 new cases each year  with no decrease in infection rates for over a decade  see pages 23 31    The Inspector General finds that of CDCs  2 6 billion in HIV AIDS grants  some have no objectives and are abysmal  yet are funded anyway  see pages 38 40    CDC spent  335 million on a kid targeted media campaign to fight obesity and found that  later  kids who saw the ads did one more activity  which may or may not have been the result of the ads  see pages 69 71    CDC pays two former employees  250 000 to  temporarily  help build staff morale  and the agency is currently seeking a full time replacement who will cost taxpayers over  1 million in the next decade  see pages 100 101    A CDC HIV AIDS prevention grantee hosted a bar night and printed magazine instructions on how to throw a good party with lots of alcohol  despite the fact that booze is a known risk factor for spreading the deadly disease  see page 104   and   128 000 in CDC bioterrorism funds were spent by Los Angeles County  a high target area  on trinkets such as letter openers  whistles  magnets  mouse pads  flashlights  pens  and travel toothbrushes  see pages 106 108     Also included in the report is a graph showing CDCs yearly budget from 1995 2007  which has increased by more than 350 percent  see page 7  and a chart showing yearly CDCs HIV AIDS funding from 2001 2007  which has more than doubled during that time  see page 115      As part of his commitment to oversight of how Washington spends taxpayer dollars  Dr  Coburn plans to release a series of oversight reports on federal agencies  Dr  Coburns hope is that better oversight will assist federal agencies  and those in Congress overseeing their budgets  in reigning in wasteful spending  in demanding measurable results from programs and grantees  and in reevaluating current spending before asking politicians and taxpayers to send more     As the report notes     CDC Off Center is not an effort to discredit the good work that the CDC and those who work for it have carried out and the good work that will continue in the future  The report will hopefully be seen for what it is  an effort to shine some light on prevention efforts and funding decisions that may be holding the agency back from fulfilling its central mission of fighting and controlling disease     Dr  Coburn encourages anyone who has examples of government waste to submit the information to his      Or by mail to his subcommittee office     Senator Tom Coburn  M D
