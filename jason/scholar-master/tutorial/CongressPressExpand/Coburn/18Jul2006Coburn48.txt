          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Says stem cell bill promotes false hope and false choices July 18  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  R OK   M D   a practicing physician who has used stem cell therapies in his medical practice  released the following statement today regarding his vote against H R  810  a bill to authorize taxpayer funded destructive experimentation on viable human life     History will vindicate President Bushs veto of this bill on the basis of science and ethics  In fact  the actual science of stem cell research has already overtaken the debate in Washington  Scientists are discovering that the most promising avenues of stem cell research do not require the destruction of viable human life  In fact  stem cell therapies derived from non embryonic sources are treating more than 70 diseases  while embryonic stem research has produced zero therapies     President Bush understands that is morally reprehensible to force taxpayers to finance the destruction of human life  particularly when science is demonstrating that ethical and non destructive forms of stem cell research can produce the same and better cures  Blocking this bill will do nothing to halt the true march of science  which is toward adult stem cell therapies     President Bushs veto will also have zero affect on private investments into both embryonic and adult stem cell research  In the real world  money follows success and it is important for the public to understand that private research dollars are flowing toward adult stem cell and germ cell research because it holds much more promise than embryonic stem cell research   What President Bushs veto will stop  however  is a step toward a brave new world of human experimentation and  eventually  cloning  Many studies have shown that embryonic stem cell research will never produce cures unless it is combined with human cloning because cloning appears to be the best  and perhaps only  way to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted heart  nerve or other tissue  This veto will also reaffirm the value of every human life at any stage  By calling for the taxpayer funded destruction of human life that will be thrown away anyway the supporters of this bill have cheapened the value of all life  particularly lives that are fragile due to age  defect  disease or disability     Finally  it is the height of arrogance for politicians who support this bill to claim they are standing on the shoulders of persecuted scientists through the ages when many supporters of embryonic stem cell research are themselves peddling false hope and superstition  Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman put it well when she said in 2004  Some of the public pronouncements in the field of stem cell research come close to over promising at best and delusional fantasizing at worst  Lord Winston  one of the most prominent embryonic stem cell researchers in the United Kingdom  has also said that hopes for cures had been distorted by arrogance and spin  Winston said in 2005  I view the current wave of optimism about embryonic stem cells with growing suspicion     Supporters of this bill have also promoted a false choice by claiming that stem cell research will grind to a halt without federal subsidies  As the supporters of the bill themselves highlighted  some of the greatest scientific discoveries in human history occurred not only without government support but in the face of tremendous persecution  Galileo never received federal subsidies but the truth of his scientific claims prevailed  Todays stem cell researchers face no such opposition and  in fact  are already being subsidized  Embryonic stem cell research has received  500 million in taxpayer funds in the past ten years  The greater threat to scientific inquiry in todays world is Washington hype and spin  which was infamously displayed in 2004 when one politician promised that H R  810 would make paralyzed people get up out of that wheelchair and walk again     Lawmakers  by and large  are more skilled at writing laws than interpreting science  Our core responsibility  therefore  is to not set legal precedents in any field  scientific or otherwise  that future generations will deeply regret  Because of Congress knowledge gap in this field many lawmakers have misunderstood the genuine scientific consensus on stem cell research  The so called consensus in favor of embryonic stem cell research is not based on irrefutable scientific conclusions  but natural scientific curiosity and  more importantly  a desire for research subsidies  grants and perhaps earmarks  The true consensus is about money  not science  Few intelligent scientists will turn down free money from unsuspecting politicians      Fact Sheet  Key Points For Ethical Stem Cell Research and Against Embryonic Stem Cell Research   Embryonic Stem Cell Research Has Failed to Produce Any Cures or Treatments   After nearly a decade of research on human embryonic stems cells  25 years of research on animal stem cells  and over  500 million in federal funding  embryonic stem cell research has yet to deliver any cures or treatments  After 25 years of research  there are zero human clinical trials or proven therapies using embryonic stem cells   Ethical Alternatives to Embryonic Stem Cells Exist   Embryos are not the only source of stem cells  Every one holds an unknown amount of stem cells that can be derived without harm or injury  These adult stem cells are capable of transforming into countless cell and tissues types have been located throughout the human body  including in the brain  muscles  blood  placentas and even in fat  Recently germ line stem cells from testes have been successfully reprogrammed into pluripotent adult stem cells with the same potential of embryonic stem cells   Stem Cells from Ethical Sources Are Now Treating Over 70 Diseases and Afflictions   Every useful stem cell therapy developed to date has not required the destruction of human embryos  According to a June 2004 report prepared by the National Institutes of Health  NIH   adult stem cells and stem cells from cord blood are currently being utilized to treat over 70 diseases and the NIH is funding another 330 human clinical trials using these cells  Adult stem cell research has revealed potential treatment and cures for afflictions such as Buergers disease  bladder disease  lupus  heart failure  stroke  liver failure  nerve regeneration  genetic metabolic disease  and respiratory conditions such as emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis  Other studies have shown that adult stem cells hold great potential to treat Parkinsons and diabetes  When asked at a June 2006 Senate hearing about the best avenues of research that could be pursued  Dr  James Battey  the director of the NIH Stem Cell Task Force responded  to me  the very most interesting thing is this frontier area of nuclear reprogramming  where you take a mature adult cell type and you effectively de differentiate it back to the a pluripotent state    Ethical Alternatives Should Be Pursued Rather Than Seeking to Save Life By Destroying Life   We all desperately want to find cures for the diseases that afflict our friends  families and neighbors  Yet in our quest to find these cures  we must not ignore or rationalize the tremendous moral questions posed by destroying living embryos  which is undeniably human life in its earliest stages  We are fortunate that ethical alternatives to destructive embryonic stem cell research exist and it is imperative that we first pursue these ethical alternatives before even considering investing in research that requires destroying life to save life    Embryonic Stem Cell Research Diverts Funding Away From More Promising Research   Over the past five years  Congress has increased funding for ESCR every year and increased annual funding almost four fold  despite zero results  This bill seeks to increase federal ESCR funding even more  despite the lack of results and the existence of ethical alternatives that has a multitude of proven results and offers countless benefits from future research  Every dollar spent on research that does not yield results is one less dollar that could have been invested in research on ethical alternatives that are already yielding cures  Again  25 years of embryonic stem cell research has produced zero cures    Embryonic Stem Cells Have Dangerous Side Effects That May Require Other Unethical Practices to Remedy   In experiment after experiment  embryonic stem cells have demonstrated that they may be too taratogenic for therapeutic purposes  It is not uncommon in experiments on mammals for the animals to be killed by tumors  Uncontrollable growth of cells is one of the main reasons embryonic stem cells can not be tested in human subjects  As a consequence  cloning embryos and then destroying them to extract their stem cells or allowing embryos to develop into fetuses so that their organs can be cultivated may be the next step  but both techniques pose additional scientific and ethical dilemmas    Adult Stem Cells Have Consistently Outperformed Embryonic Stem Cells for Therapeutic Purposes   Virtually every breakthrough announced using embryonic stem cells in animal models has been preceded by a similar feat with often greater results using adult stem cells    Very Few Surplus Embryos Are Available for Research   Proponents of destructive embryonic stem cell research claim that surplus embryos are going to be discarded anyway  A RAND study has found that to the contrary  very few embryos are expected to be discarded  The vast majority88 2  are designated for family building and another 2 3  are being donated to other families for adoption  According to the RAND study  embryos available for research do not have high development potential and very embryonic stem cell lines could be created from the embryos available for research  This means that embryos would have to be created specifically for destruction is additional stem cell lines were to be created for research    Patients Need Cures Not False Hopes   Leading proponents of research on embryonic stem cells are themselves lowering expectations that dramatic cures to diseases such as Alzheimers  The Guardian newspaper recently reported that Lord Winston  the most prominent embryonic stem cell researcher in the United Kingdom  said that hopes for cures had been distorted by arrogance and spin  I view the current wave of optimism about embryonic stem cells with growing suspicion  Winston told the British Association for the Advancement of Science  A leading embryonic stem cell researcher in South Korea who hailed some of the most promising advances in the field has admitted to falsifying his research  Exaggerated predications and expectations used to promote embryonic stem cell research exploit patients and families desperately seeking cures       For more information on stem cell research please access the Right Now section
