          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Coburn Martinez to reintroduce legislation similar to Bush   s health proposal January 23  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement tonight in response to President Bushs State of the Union Address     President Bush deserves credit for delivering a speech filled with specific  realistic and substantive proposals  Congress now has to decide whether to work with President Bush in a spirit of bipartisan compromise or continue its do nothing habits voters rejected in November  Dr  Coburn said     As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned last week  the right time for Congress to get serious about fixing challenges like health care was ten years ago  If Congress continues to ignore this problem  the next generation of Americans will be the first to inherit a lower standard of living  President Bush has outlined a series of proposals that will reverse our slide toward socialized medicine and put consumers back in charge of their health care dollars and decisions  By empowering individuals and promoting competition  the Presidents common sense proposals will make health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans  Dr  Coburn said   During the last session of Congress  Dr  Coburn cosponsored with U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  The Tax Equity and Affordability Act  S  3754  which contained many of the reforms President Bush outlined tonight  Senators Martinez and Coburn plan to reintroduce an updated version of S  3754 tomorrow     I also commend President Bush for his determination to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and improve our energy security  Dr  Coburn added  By reducing our gasoline usage by 20 percent over the next ten years through conservation and investments in new technology we will weaken potential enemies and terrorists  Some of the nations we depend on for oil supplies directly or indirectly support terrorism  It is unconscionable that the American people pay what amounts to an al Qaeda tax every time they fill their tank with gas     Finally  I applaud President Bush for calling on Congress to reform the earmark process and reduce the total number and cost of earmarks  However  I would urge the President to use his leverage to take more aggressive steps  For example  the President simply can refuse to implement the earmarks that are slipped into so called report language because those earmarks are not legally binding  As Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin  D IL  recently said during floor debate  pork projects in report language have no more legal authority than a note to your sister  Ninety five percent of all earmarks are funded in this manner  The President should also send Congress a message and pledge to veto any ethics and lobbying reform bill that is weaker than the version passed by the House  Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          9 488 538 856 000 00      31 090 19 Per Citizen
