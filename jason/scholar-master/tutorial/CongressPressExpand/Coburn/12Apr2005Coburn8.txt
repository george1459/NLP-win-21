                                                                 April 12  2005  WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Tom Coburn  R OK   a practicing physician  praised the release of a GAO report that holds the CDC and FDA accountable for providing inaccurate information to the public     The public may be at risk    because the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  ignored scientific data that condoms and other contraceptives containing the spermicide nonoxynol 9  N 9  increase HIV infection risk and recommended their use for HIV prevention  according to a new report released today by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO   Since 1989  studies have repeatedly found that contraceptives containing N 9 increased HIV infection risk  Despite these findings  FDA  Planned Parenthood and government funded Title X clinics continued to promote condoms and contraceptives with N 9 for increased HIV prevention  Eighty seven percent of condoms distributed by federally funded family planning clinics that provided purchase data to researchers were N 9 lubricated  according to a study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 2002  Despite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  warnings in 2000 that the use of N 9 may be harmful  Planned Parenthood Federation of America only stopped manufacturing N 9 condoms in 2002  According to the new GAO investigation findings  even as the evidence mounted demonstrating the dangers of N 9 use  FDA provided contradicting claims  A 1999 FDA brochure stated that N 9 in addition to a condom may be used to prevent HIV transmission  The GAO report states    FDA did not revise its 1999 brochure that stated that some experts believe N 9 may prevent HIV and suggested N 9 use along with a condom  FDA left this information on its Web site until these statements were deleted in 2003 when FDA officials realized that the information in the brochure and on its website were inconsistent with proposed warning labels    being developed by the agency as a result of a 2000 law  As of March 2005  GAO notes that    FDA has not finalized the new warning labels for N 9 vaginal contraceptive products  and has not proposed new warning labels for N 9 condoms     GAO   s report also concluded that the information provided by the CDC about the use of N 9    has been  at times  inconsistent     In 1993  CDC recommended the use of condoms with or without N 9 to protect against STDs  including HIV  By 2000  however  CDC   s educational publications had included the statement that N 9 may increase the risk of transmission  Due to concerns about medical inaccuracy on condom labels  Congress in 2000 passed a law requiring FDA to ensure that labels on condoms  including those containing N 9  are medically accurate  That same year  then Congressman Tom Coburn and Congressman Joe Pitts asked GAO to investigate the role of FDA and other federal agencies in the promotion of N 9 products for HIV prevention  Another GAO request was submitted by Congressmen Pitts  Mark Souder and Dave Weldon in 2002   Senator Coburn  M D   stated    Congress passed a law signed by President Bill Clinton directing the FDA to provide the public with medically accurate information about condoms  including those containing N 9  precisely because the agency and others have downplayed the short comings of condoms and exaggerated their effectiveness  Condoms do not protect against the most common STD    human papillomavirus  HPV   which causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer    and contraceptives with N 9 increase HIV risk  Despite these clear scientific conclusions and a four year old law requiring these truths to be displayed  you would never know these important facts from reading a condom label     Congressman Weldon  M D   noted    these findings present just another example of how Planned Parenthood  Title X clinics and federal agencies have distorted science to promote a social policy that has the exact opposite impact of the stated goal  We may never know the toll in terms of new HIV cases that have resulted from the promotion and distribution  with taxpayer dollars   of N 9 containing condoms        All we   re saying is that the facts have been ignored  This study pokes holes in what many claimed was an airtight  foolproof case for using condoms and N 9 for HIV prevention  In reality  this combination offers people higher risk instead of better prevention  To have ignored this data or to have misled the public on something this serious is an outrage     said Congressman Pitts  Congressman Souder  Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice  Drug Policy and Human Resources  called FDA before Congress last March to have officials explain the agency   s delay in relabeling condoms and to warn consumers about the dangers of N 9     FDA has failed to meet its mission to inform and protect the public  Without aggressive oversight from Congress  the agency may never have stopped promoting dangerous N 9 products or act to warn consumers of the dangers of N 9     The report is entitled    Efforts to Research and Inform the Public About Nonoxynol 9 and HIV
