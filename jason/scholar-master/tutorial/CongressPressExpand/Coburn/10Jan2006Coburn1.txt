          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      January 10  2006 JANUARY 9  2006 Judge Alito  welcome   I know you re tired of this and I ll try to be as brief as possible  One of the advantages of going last is to be able to hear what everybody else has said   And as I ve listened today  we ve talked about the unfortunate  the frail  The quotes have been fair shake for those that are underprivileged  We ve heard values  strong  free and fair  progressive judiciary  We ve heard the vulnerable  the more vulnerable  the weak  those who suffer  We ve heard of an Alito mold that has to be in the mold of somebody else   And as a practicing physician  the one disheartening thing that I hear is this very common word  this right to choose and how we sterilize that to not talk about what it really is   I ve had the unfortunate privilege of carrying over 300 women who ve had complications from this wonderful right to choose to kill their unborn babies  And that s what it is  It s the right of convenience to take the life   And the question that arises as we use all these adjectives and adverbs to describe our physicians as we approach a Supreme Court nominee is where are we in America when we decide that it s legal to kill our unborn children   I mean  it s a real question for us  I debate honestly with those who disagree with me on this  It is a real issue  a measurement of our society  when we say it s fine to destroy unborn life who has a heartbeat at 16 days post conception    Thirty nine days post  conception you can measure the brain waves and there s pain felt   The ripping and tearing of an unborn child from his mother s womb through the hands of another  and we say  That s fine  you have a constitutional right to do that   How is it that we have a right of privacy and due process to do that but you don t have the right  as rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court in 1997  to take your own life in assisted suicide   You know  how is it that we have sodomy protected under that due process but prostitution unprotected  It s schizophrenic  And the reason it s schizophrenic is there s no foundation for it whatsoever other than a falsely created foundation that is in error   I don t know if we ll ever change that  It s a measure of our society   But the fact is that you can t claim  in this Senate hearing  to care for those that are underprivileged  to those that are at risk  to those that are vulnerable  to those that are weak  to those that suffer and  at the same time  say I don t care about those who have been ripped from the wombs of women and the complications that have come about throughout that   So  the debate  for the American public    and the real debate here is about Roe   We re going to go off in all sorts of directions  but the decisions that are going to be made on votes on the committee and the votes on the floor is going to be about Roe  whether or not we as a society have decided that this is an ethical process  that we have this convenient process that if we want to rationalize one moral choice with another  we just do it through abortion  this taking of the life  of life of an unborn child   I asked Chief Justice Roberts about this definition of life    you know  what is life  The Supreme Court can t figure it out or doesn t want us to figure it out  the fact that we know that there is no life if there s no heartbeat and brainwaves  We know that in every state and every territory  But when we have heartbeat and brain waves  we refuse to accept it as the presence of life    this lack of logic of which we approach this issue because we like and we favor convenience over ethics  We favor convenience over the hard parts of life that actually make us grow   Senator Brownback talked about those with disabilities that are destroyed in the womb because of a genetic test that is sometimes wrong  I would put forward that we all have disabilities   Some of us  you just can t see it  And yet  who makes the decisions as to whether we re qualified or not   We ve gone down a road to which we don t have the answers for  That s why we have the schizophrenic decisions coming out of the Supreme Court that don t balance logically with one versus another decision   So my hope  is as we go through this process  let s not confuse it with the easy words and really be honest and straightforward about what this is about   I firmly believe that the court should take another direction on many of these moral issues that face us  If we re to honor the heritage of our country  whether it be in terms of religious freedom  whether it be in terms of truly protecting life  protecting not just the unborn but who comes next  the infirm  the elderly  the maimed  the disabled    that s who comes next as we get into the budget crunch of taking care of those people in the years    I believe we ought to have that debate honest and openly   But the fact is  is we re going to cover it with everything except the real fact is we ve made a mistake going down that road in terms of saying we can destroy our unborn children and there s no consequences to it   So I welcome you   This is a difficult process for you and your family  I am hopeful that you will be treated fairly   I m very disturbed at the picture that was painted by Senator Kennedy that you re not a man of your word  that you re dishonest  The implication that you re not reliable I don t think is a fair characterization of what I ve read   And I look forward to you being able to giving answers  as you can  to your philosophy   The real debate is we ve had an activist court  and the American people don t want an activist court  And the real fear from those who might oppose you is that you ll bring the court back within a realm where the American people might want us to be with a Supreme Court  one that interprets the law  equal justice under the law  but not advancing without us advancing  the legislative body advancing  ahead of you   I welcome you   I return the balance of my time and I look forward for your introduction and your opening statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             9 488
