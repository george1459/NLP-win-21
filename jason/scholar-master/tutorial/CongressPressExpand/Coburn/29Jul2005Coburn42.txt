          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      July 29  2005   WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  commented today on his vote against the Interior Appropriations and the Legislative Branch Appropriations bills saying it was an effort to trim federal spending during a time of massive budget deficits       At a time when our nation is on unsustainable fiscal course it is immoral for Congress to continue to spend uncontrollably  We will see a budget deficit this year of more than  500 billion  or an extra  1 650 in debt for every man woman and child  That is in addition to the national debt of nearly  8 trillion  or nearly  26 000 per person     Dr  Coburn said       Like most other spending bills  the Interior Appropriations bill is littered with earmarks to gain political favor back home     Dr  Coburn noted     Congress also has no business increasing legislative appropriations for itself by  228 million when we are running massive deficits  fighting a war and facing the collapse of Social Security and Medicare  Politicians continue to worry about the next election and not the next generation       Some of the so called    priority    projects in the Interior Appropriations bills include   Nearly  110 million for federal land acquisition  though  92 million for the same purpose allocated last year has not been spent  Almost  7 million for the conservation of African and Asian elephants and Great Apes   200 000 for a science project on chicken in Texas  Nearly  3 million for research on emerald ash borers and pine beetles   1 2 million to re locate a fire station in California   Also retained in the Interior Appropriations bill is language to allow earmarks  or political pet projects  to be hidden in the conference report  a Beltway budget trick to mask true spending habits  Not listing earmarks in the final version of bills makes it nearly impossible for the American public to know how its money is being spent   Dr  Coburn offered an amendment to require all earmarks be listed in conference reports  but the amendment was defeated by a vote of 59 to 33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 9 488 546 975 440 00      31 090 22 Per Citizen
