          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Unveils Web site cataloguing areas needing oversight October 24  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released a list of current U N  scandals today on the 62nd anniversary of the United Nations  The U N  charter declares the purpose of the world body is to maintain peace and security  develop friendly relations based on respect for equal rights and self determination  and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  Unfortunately  62 years later  the United Nations is incapable of living up to its charter     For years  there have been attempts to reform the United Nations  both from the secretariat and from the world bodys donors  Unfortunately  all reform efforts have failed     The best way to honor the United Nations on its birthday is to help the organization cure its cancer of corruption  fraud  secrecy and impotence that is preventing the United Nations from achieving its mission  Dr  Coburn said     To that end  Dr  Coburn has unveiled a Web site  the   cataloguing the growing list of scandals and released the following list of examples currently plaguing the United Nations    U N  procurement tainted by fraud   According to internal United Nations auditors  43 percent of U N  procurement investigated is tainted by fraud  Out of  1 4 billion in U N  contracts internally investigated   610 million was tainted by 10 significant fraud and corruption schemes  Since 43 percent of the procurement contracts are tainted and the United States contributes up to 25 percent of all U N  funding  it is safe to say that an amount equal to well above entire U S  contribution in this case has been lost to corruption and waste  1    U N  props up dictators and state sponsors of terror   According to leaked reports  U N  whistleblowers  and U S  investigators  U N  operations in places like North Korea  Burma  Syria  Iran  Cuba  and Zimbabwe have been transferring cash and resources to these unaccountable regimes and state sponsors of terror in the name of humanitarian assistance and capacity building  2  For example  according to leaked reports  U S  investigators found cash transfers between the U N  Development Program and bank accounts used by the North Korean regime to purchase missiles  3    U N  rewards dictators and human rights abusers with leadership posts  The United Nations regularly permits countries subject to U N  sanctions  human rights abusers and state sponsors of terror to hold leadership posts in critical U N  programs and committees  Here are a few examples  4    U N  Security Council  Libya   International Atomic Energy Agency General Committee  Syria  Vice President   U N  Disarmament Commission  Iran  Vice Chairman  Syria  Rapporteur   Committee on Information  China  Kazakhstan   Commission for Social Development  North Korea   Commission on Sustainable Development  Sudan   Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice  Libya  Russia   U N  Children s Fund  UNICEF   Burma  Vice President  China  Board   General Assembly s First Committee on Disarmament and International Security  Syria  Vice Chairman   U N  High Commissioner for Refugees Executive Committee  Lebanon  Somalia  Sudan   World Food Programme Executive Board  Zimbabwe  Sudan   U N  glorifying terrorism   According to the U N  charter  the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security  Terrorism is the primary threat to international peace and security  yet the United Nations has failed to establish a legitimate working definition of terrorism  it has appointed states directly supporting terrorism to leadership posts  has accredited organizations that openly support and glorify terrorism  and provided direct funding and other in kind resources to terrorist regimes  5    U N  Peacekeeping operations plagued by rape and sexual exploitation of refugees  In 1994  a draft U N  report was leaked detailing how peacekeepers in Morocco  Pakistan  Uruguay  Tunis  South Africa and Nepal were involved in 68 cases of rape  prostitution and pedophilia  The report also stated that the investigation into these cases is being undermined by bribery and witness intimidation by U N  personnel  6  In 2006  it was reported that peacekeepers in Haiti and Liberia were involved in sexual exploitation of refugees  7  This year  leaked reports indicate the United Nations has caught 200 peacekeepers for sex offenses in the past three years ranging from rape to assault on minors  In all of these cases  there is no known evidence of an offending U N  peacekeeper being prosecuted  8    U N  Human Rights Council hijacked by Anti Semitism   In 2006  the U N  Human Rights Council replaced the discredited U N  Human Rights Commission  due to growing criticism over the human rights abusers permitted to sit on the Commission  the use of the Commission to promote bigotry and anti Semitism  and the failure of the Commission to hold human rights violators accountable  Unfortunately  the new U N  Human Rights Council is simply a letterhead change  and continues to give abusers seats on the Council while devoting almost its entire agenda to prejudiced attacks on the only democratic country in the Middle East  Israel  9    U N  scam permitted illegal entry into the U S   A U N  employee from Russia was arrested in August of this year for operating an illegal visa scam lasting at least two years  The official assisted non U S  citizens to enter the United States with fraudulent U N  documents  including the use of U N  letterhead  in order to obtain visas to attend U N  conferences that either did not exist or they did not attend  10    U N  smuggling diamonds in Zimbabwe  It is reported that a U N  official in Zimbabwe is also the chairman of a mining company co owned by the vice president of Zimbabwe  a former member of parliament  and an ambassador of Zimbabwe  The mining company is accused of asset stripping worth  116 million and using the U N  Development Program to facilitate diamond smuggling  11    U N  graft and cover up at the Khmer Rogue Tribunal in Cambodia  It is reported that  unlike previous U N  tribunals set up to prosecute war criminals in Sierra Leone and East Timor  the U N  permitted the Cambodian government to infiltrate and dominate the Khmer Rogue tribunal with a majority of government appointed judges  lawyers  and staff  The United Nations also granted Cambodias demand that every case be decided by a judge single  government appointed judge  rather than an independently appointed jury  as is the standard  International observers claim Cambodias judicial system is notoriously corrupt  inefficient and poorly administered  Making matters worse  the U N  Development Program handed over millions of dollars to the Cambodian government to operate the tribunal  Reports indicate this money was used in a bribery and kick back scheme where employees would be forced to give a portion of their salaries to Cambodian officials in order to maintain their jobs or receive appointments to higher positions  12    U N  Development Program Global Environment Facility  UNDP GEF  corruption  The U N  Development Program operates the Global Environment Facility which is involved in multiple scandals  including alleged procurement fraud in Africa worth  8 million  When a U N  official blew the whistle  the United Nations retaliated against the whistleblower  In another example  reports indicate the UNDP GEF in the Philippines is operated by an official who also helps runs a local  non government organization  NGO   This official allegedly awarded grants to her own NGO and then diverted funds from the NGO to enrich her family  When a U N  employee blew the whistle  the United Nations covered it up  13    U N  World Intellectual Property Organization  WIPO  graft A Sudanese national who has run the WIPO since 1997 has falsified his U N  personnel file to drop nine years from his age  making it possible to extend his time at WIPO and to extend his ability to obtain a lucrative benefit package  including a possible payout of more than  500 000  The scandal was first reported in a leaked U S  State Department cable authored by Secretary Rice  The cable also states that this same Sudanese official is suspected of using U N  funds for personal items such as the construction of a swimming pool at his residence  14        1  See Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management website
