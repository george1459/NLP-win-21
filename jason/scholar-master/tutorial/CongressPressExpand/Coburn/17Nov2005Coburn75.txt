          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      November 17  2005  WASHINGTON  D C       The Senate tonight rebuked the Ethics Committee   s handling of U S  Senator Tom Coburn   s  M D   R OK  request to continue his not for profit medical practice by a margin of 51 to 47        I   m deeply grateful that a majority of my colleagues concluded that my desire to maintain my connection to the real world and serve my patients is an asset to the U S  Senate  I look forward to continuing to serve the people of Oklahoma as the citizen legislator I pledged to be     said Dr  Coburn  who has pledged to serve no more than two terms in the U S  Senate     As a member of the House of Representatives from 1995 2001  Dr  Coburn was allowed to practice medicine on a not for profit basis  Dr  Coburn could earn enough to cover his costs but not receive any profit  During this period he delivered more than 400 babies and none of the parents of the babies he delivered chose him hoping to sway his vote    Prior to being sworn in as a member of the Senate  Dr  Coburn received an unsolicited letter from the Senate Ethics Committee advising him that such an arrangement would be a violation of Senate Rules and a conflict of interest  The amendment offered tonight by Senator Trent Lott  R MI   Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee  asked the Senate to reject the Senate Ethics Committee   s narrow interpretation of Senate rules and adopt the House of Representative   s common sense position     Lacking majority support of Senators for its interpretation of Senate Rules  Senator George Voinovich  R OH   Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee  used a procedural maneuver to frustrate the will of the Senate and block formal acceptance of the Lott amendment        I am saddened by the mindless partisanship reflected in tonight   s vote     Dr  Coburn said after learning that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid  D NV  had lobbied Democrats to vote against the Lott amendment     I appreciate the courage of the four Democrats  Thomas Carper  D DE   Mark Dayton  D MN   Mary Landrieu  D LA   and Barack Obama  D IL  who put common sense ahead of partisan loyalty  Few Americans can comprehend the notion that it is a conflict of interest for me to deliver babies on a not for profit basis  but it is not a conflict of interest for other Senators to make unlimited royalties from books deals or have special interest groups cover their travel and lodging costs for political speeches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 9 488 547 712 010 00      31 090 22 Per Citizen
