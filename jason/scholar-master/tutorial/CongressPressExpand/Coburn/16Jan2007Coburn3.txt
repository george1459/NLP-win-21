          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      January 16  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today hailed Senate passage of the DeMint amendment to S  1 the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007  The DeMint amendment  which is nearly identical to earmark reform language authored by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  D CA  and passed by the House  greatly strengthens the Senate bill by including in its definition of earmarks projects that are inserted into committee reports  The original Senate bill did not contain this definition and therefore excluded 95 percent of all earmarks     Passage of the DeMint amendment is a significant step toward honesty and transparency in government  I applaud my colleagues for accepting a measure that will show the American people that we are serious about changing the culture in Washington  Dr  Coburn said    I also applaud the Senate Democrats who broke with their leadership last week and supported the Pelosi language  Dr  Coburn added  Democrats who voted for the Pelosi language in the DeMint amendment included Senators Maria Cantwell  D WA   Russ Feingold  D WI   Tom Harkin  D IA   John Kerry  D MA   Mary Landrieu  D LA   Barack Obama  D IL   Jon Tester  D MT  and Jim Webb  D VA      I would also like to applaud Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin  D IL  for his statement during last weeks floor debate that earmarks contained in report language do not have the force of law and should presumably be ignored by federal agencies  I agree with Senator Durbins statement that backdoor earmarks in report language have no more legal authority than a note to your sister  and I would therefore encourage all agencies to consider earmarks in report language as such  said Dr  Coburn  who has urged the Bush administration to not enact earmark requests that do not have the force of law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          9 488 538 804 610 00      31 090 19 Per Citizen
