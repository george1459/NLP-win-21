          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      December 6  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today applauded the passage of legislation that will update and renew the Ryan White CARE Act for three more years  The CARE Act is the largest HIV AIDS specific federal program  funded at more than  2 billion and reaching more than 500 000 individuals each year  The programs reauthorization expired over a year ago but has been blocked by members of the Senate who objected to the bills effort to ensure more equitable distribution of federal funding     Since this bill was last called up in the Senate in October  three patients on waiting lists for AIDS drugs passed away  noted Dr  Coburn  a practicing physician who has treated patients with HIV AIDS  The compromise bill approved by the Senate today will extend the special funding advantage that has benefited urban areas  but will ensure that federal funding is more fairly targeted so that all those living with HIV AIDS will have access to life saving treatment    It is unfair that San Francisco receives funding for AIDS patients who passed away decades ago while there have been reports of patients on waiting lists dying in South Carolina  Kentucky and West Virginia due to the fact that patients in those areas living with the disease are not recognized for purposes of federal funding  Dr  Coburn said  Federal funding formulas will now finally recognize everyone living with HIV rather than just those diagnosed with AIDS  the end stage of HIV infection  This focus on AIDS has  in effect  discriminated against patients in rural areas  minority communities  women and other emerging communities affected by this disease     Waiting until someone has progressed to AIDS is far too late to maximize the potential of treatment and has created health care funding disparities with real consequences  most notably waiting lists for AIDS drugs  Waiting lists containing hundreds of patients in states with emerging epidemics  in fact  have become commonplace and an estimated 42 to 59 percent of Americans living with HIV AIDS are not in regular HIV care  It is unacceptable that anyone in America infected with HIV can not access medical care and treatment when the federal government is spending  21 1 billion on this disease every year  said Dr  Coburn  In addition to more equitable funding  Dr  Coburn praised the bills focus on early intervention and primary medical care and treatment     This bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to provide additional resources to areas that have prioritized efforts to eliminate baby AIDS and promote routine HIV testing  Early intervention can improve the health and prolong the lives of patients and also prevent the spread of the disease  Without the benefit of being diagnosed  patients are denied treatment  yet more than 300 000 Americans with HIV do not know that they are infected  noted Dr  Coburn     This bill makes primary medical care and access to treatment the priority of CARE Act programs  Dr  Coburn added  We now have the ability to make HIV infection a manageable disease for many  AIDS is no longer a certain death sentence as long as patients have access to the miraculous drug that are now available but were only dreamed of when this law was first passed in 1990  The bill approved today recognizes and reflects these achievements     I would like to also recognize the efforts of Senators Enzi and Kennedy and their staffs for the months of negotiations that made this bill possible despite the obstacles as well as their personal commitment to caring for those affected by HIV AIDS  but most importantly I would like to thank President Bush who has made combating HIV AIDS  both domestically and globally  a priority of his Administration over the past six years  said Dr  Coburn                                                                                                                                                                               9 488 546 273 130 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
