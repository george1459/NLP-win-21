                                                                Legislation will give individuals same tax benefits as businesses January 25  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  and Mel Martinez  R FL  today introduced the Tax Equity and Affordability Act of 2007  The measure seeks to lower the cost and expand the availability of health insurance  The bill includes many of the reform proposals President Bush outlined in his State of the Union address such as establishingnew tax breaks for individuals and families without employer based health insurance  Joining Coburn and Martinez as co sponsors were Senators Jim Inhofe  R OK   Norm Coleman  R MN   John Cornyn  R TX  and Jeff Sessions  R AL      We are on the cusp of a battle that may determine the future of health care in America  Everyone in America supports the concept of universal health care coverage  The important question is  Who will control it  government bureaucrats or consumers  Those who are advocating a government run health plan are offering a nave and destructive vision  American families deserve real choices and a fair market  not the counterfeit compassion of a utopian government run health care system  This legislation will help us reverse our slide toward socialized medicine by putting patients back in charge of their health care dollars and decisions  Dr  Coburn said  noting that the best available case studies indicate that single payer socialized health care systems in places like Canada and the U K  result in rationing and poor quality     This bill promotes universal access  market innovation  and fairness in the health care market by establishing an individual health care tax credit  Dr  Coburn added  There is no reason individuals should not enjoy the same tax benefits employers have received for decades     The federal tax code offers several health care tax breaks  totaling approximately  188 5 billion in federal revenues  Of that total last year   126 billion went through employers for employee fringe benefits  The current system essentially creates a tax subsidy for wealthy Americans worth  2 680 while only  102 for the poorest Americans  The Tax Equity and Affordability Act of 2007 modernizes the tax treatment of health care to fit the needs of working Americans in the 21st century     The Tax Equity and Affordability Act of 2007 would establish a new mechanism for the purchase of health insurance  refundable tax credits for working Americans enabling them to purchase their own private health care coverage  Low income Americans would get  2 000   4 000 for families  and an income based sliding scale would ensure that all Americans get a health tax benefit that mimics the benefit that employers benefit from through the exclusion     The legislation limits the unlimited employer exclusion at  5 000 for self only   11 500 for family  employer coverage  as recommended by the Bi Partisan Tax Reform Panel  This curbs the subsidization of so called Cadillac health plans for wealthy Americans  producing enormous savings that will help finance access to private health coverage for all Americans  Workers  instead of their Human Resources department  could choose what kind of health care to buy  The plan promotes innovation and choice to stabilize skyrocketing health care costs of todays broken system     By giving tax breaks equitably and directly to individuals for health care  we can ensure that patients and doctors  not government or insurance bureaucrats  will make decisions about their health care  Dr  Coburn said  This approach promotes ownership of health benefits and a truly transparent  market based  and portable system  Allowing individuals to make choices about their health care unleashes the power of American innovation  which will provide better health care at a better price  One out of every five Oklahomans lacks health insurance  I have far more faith in the ability of Oklahomans to make health care choices instead of allowing Washington to make those choices for them     Senator Martinez said  Health insurance should be affordable and accessible  There are more than 47 million Americans  including 4 million Floridians  who need  but are unable to purchase health insurance because of the cost  This proposal will make insurance more affordable for more people  including those who dont have health insurance through an employer  The TEA Act promotes personal choice  ownership  and portability of health insurance  regardless of employment status     This provides a more level playing field for taxpayers and their families who do not have access to employer provided plans  Martinez said  These individuals deserve a health tax credit equal to the benefits enjoyed by workers whose employers provide health insurance  This act will go a long way toward insuring the more than 47 million Americans who are currently going without coverage
