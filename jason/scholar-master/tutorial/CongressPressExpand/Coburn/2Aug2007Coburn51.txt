          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Disappointed Senate secretly eviscerated earmark reforms August 2  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement today regarding his vote against the Senates flawed ethics and lobbying reform bill   This bill is a landmark betrayal  not a landmark accomplishment  Congress had a historic opportunity to expose secretive pork barrel spending but instead created new ways to hide that spending  Anti incumbent attitudes  which were already at an all time high  will only grow when the public realizes this bill was a sham  Dr  Coburn said     Earmarks have been at the heart of recent scandals that have sent members of Congress to prison and brought others under investigation  It is no coincidence that as the lobbying industry doubled in size since 2000 so did the amount of money Congress spent on earmarks  The problem in Washington is not the lobbyists  The problem is members of Congress who send earmarks to special interests  and even family members  in an effort to stay in office or feather their own nest  Dr  Coburn said     Im disappointed Senate leaders refused to implement  as a simple Senate rule  earmark reforms originally written by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  D CA  which passed the Senate 98 0  The effort to get the Senate to accept these reforms was about helping the majority party keep its own promises to the American people  Our concern that Senate leaders would gut these reforms in an unnecessary conference setting was well founded  Dr  Coburn said     Key differences between the original Senate passed Pelosi language and the current bill include the following   see attached detailed explanation of changes in bill text     The new bill makes disclosure voluntary rather than mandatory  The new bill fires the Senates current referee  the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian  and makes one teams quarterback  the Majority Leader  the referee  During floor debate  the Senate parliamentarian directly contradicted Senate leaders and bill supporters when he confirmed that the Senate parliamentarian would be powerless to certify whether earmark disclosure requirements had been met  The bill also turns the tables on reformers by allowing earmark abuses to be protected by 41 votes rather than 67 votes  Dr  Coburn said     The ethics reform measures that matter most in our system are transparency and accountability  which occurs through frequent elections  I was proud to have worked with my colleague Barack Obama  D IL  last year on legislation that creates transparency after the fact  Our bill  the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006  which was signed into law by President Bush  will allow every American to see how every federal dollar is spent through a Google like search engine  Dr  Coburn said     Congress could have created genuine before the fact transparency with this bill  Sadly  private citizens  watchdog groups and congressional offices will have to continue to play hide and seek with congressional appropriators  The public is tired of this game and will grow even more frustrated when it sees the same game played out later this year  Taxpayers should not have to wait on search warrants to find out how Congress is spending its money  Dr  Coburn said   Changes in original and watered down ethics bill     1  Prohibits Senators from trading earmarks for votes   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES    INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The original language included in the Senate passed bill  and also included in the House rules  prohibited Members from conditioning the inclusion of earmarks on a Members vote on any given matter  No such prohibition is included in the new bill  Members of the House have already used this rule against Rep  John Murtha  sadly Murtha won the vote  in response to his threat on the House floor to withhold earmarks from another Member     Original language  A Member may not condition the inclusion of language to provide funding for a congressional earmark  a limited tax benefit  or a limited tariff benefit in any bill or joint resolution  or an accompanying report  or in any conference report on a bill or joint resolution  including an accompanying joint explanatory statement of managers  on any vote cast by another Member  Delegate  or Resident Commissioner    2  Prohibits Senators from promoting earmarks that would financially benefit themselves  their immediate family  their staff  a their staffs immediately family   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES    INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The original language included in the Senate passed bill  and also included in the House rules  prohibited Members and their staff from promoting earmarks from which they would financially benefit  The original language was drafted very broadly to ensure that there would be no hint of corruption in the awarding of earmarks  The new language is so narrow as to be meaningless  By using the phrase to further only his pecuniary interest  the language would only appear to apply to an earmark that went straight to a Senators bank account     Original language  No Member shall use his official position to introduce  request  or otherwise aid the progress or passage of a congressional earmark that will financially benefit or otherwise further the pecuniary interest of such Member  the spouse of such Member  the immediate family member of such Member  any employee on the staff of such Member  the spouse of an employee on the staff of such Member  or immediate family member of an employee on the staff of such Member     New language  No Member  officer  or employee of the Senate shall knowingly use his official position to introduce  request  or otherwise aid the progress or passage of congressionally directed spending items  limited tax benefits  or limited tariff benefits a principal purpose of which is to further only his pecuniary interest  only the pecuniary interest of his immediate family  or only the pecuniary interest of a limited class of persons or enterprises  when he or his immediate family  or enterprises controlled by them  are members of the affected class    3  Allows the Senate parliamentarian to determine compliance with the new earmark disclosure rule   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES   INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The language in the Senate passed bill gave the parliamentarian the ability to determine compliance with the earmark disclosure rule  In contrast  the language in the new bill allows the chairman of the relevant committee or the Majority Leader or his designee to certify compliance with the rule  The result is that the Senate parliamentarian must now defer to the Majority Leader on compliance with the earmark disclosure rule  Even if no earmarks are listed  if the Majority Leader certifies that the bill is in compliance  then the parliamentarian must abide by that ruling  In that event  reformers would need 60 votes to enforce the rule  even though the original language would have required only 34 votes to enforce the rule     Original language  The original language required earmarks to be publicly available prior to the consideration of any legislation  Because of the way that language was intentionally drafted  the power of determining compliance with the rule was given to the Senate parliamentarian     New language  It shall not be in order to vote on a motion to proceed to consider a bill or joint resolution  etc   reported by any committee unless the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction or the Majority Leader or his or her designee certifies that the required information has been made available     4  Prohibits consideration of bills  joint resolutions  and conference reports if earmarks are not disclosed   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES   INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO  Background  The language in the Senate passed bill prohibited consideration of any legislation prior to the disclosure of all earmarks  In contrast  the language in the new bill only prevents a vote on a motion to proceed to legislation with earmarks  The result is that legislation that is proceeded to by consent  without a vote  will not be subject to the earmark disclosure rules in the new bill     Original language  It shall not be in order to considera bill or joint resolution  or a conference report until the required information has been made available      New language  It shall not be in order to vote on a motion to proceed to consider a bill or joint resolution unless the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction or the Majority Leader or his or her designee certifies that the required information has been made available  AND It shall not be in order to vote on a motion to proceed to consider a bill or joint resolution unless the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction or the Majority Leader or his or her designee certifies that the required information has been made available     5  Requires earmarks attached to a conference report to be publicly available on the Internet in a searchable format 48 hours before consideration   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES   INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The original language in the Senate passed bill required information to be disclosed on the Internet in a searchable format  While the new language in the new bill applies searchability requirement to bills and joint resolutions  it does not require earmarks in a conference report to be disclosed in a searchable format  Specifically  the language in the new bill states that searchability is not required if it is not technically feasible  This is notable because Sen  Durbin claimed that he strengthened the original earmark provision  after initially voting to kill it  by requiring information to be disclosed in a searchable format     Original language  The original language stated that earmark lists must be made available on the Internet in a searchable format to the general public for at least 48 hours before consideration of legislation     New language  To the extent technically feasible  information made available on publicly accessible congressional websites under paragraphs 3 and 4  for conference reports  shall be provided in a searchable format    6  Requires 67 votes to suspend the earmark disclosure rule   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES   INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The original language in the Senate passed bill allowed the earmark disclosure rule to be suspended only by suspending the Standing Rules of the Senate  Riddicks Senate Procedure notes that  a ny rule of the Senate may be suspended at any time after a days notice in writing by a two thirds vote  The best case scenario for enforcement of the new rule is that 40 votes  instead of 34  will now be needed to force compliance with the earmark disclosure rules  The worst case scenario  due in part to the new ability of the Majority Leader to unilaterally waive the rules  is that 60 votes  instead of the original 34 votes  may now be needed to enforce the rules     Original language  The original language provided no waiver process  The result is that the rule could only be suspended by a two thirds vote     New language  Any Senator may move to waive any or all points of order under this paragraph with respect to the pending conference report by an affirmative vote of three fifths of the Members  duly chosen and sworn  All motions to waive under this paragraph shall be debatable collectively for not to exceed 1 hour equally divided between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their designees  A motion to waive all points of order under this paragraph shall not be amendable    7  Requires a full day s notice prior to attempting to suspend the earmark disclosure rule  INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES   INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The original language in the Senate passed bill allowed the earmark disclosure rule to be suspended only by suspending the Standing Rules of the Senate  Riddicks Senate Procedure notes that  a ny rule of the Senate may be suspended at any time after a days notice in writing by a two thirds vote  The new waiver language does not require any notice to the Senate prior to an attempt to waive the earmark disclosure rules     Original language  The original language in the Senate passed bill provided no process by which the earmark disclosure rule could be waived  The result was that it could be waived only according to the terms provided through Rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate  Rule V states  in part  No motion to suspend  modify  or amend any rule  or any part thereof  shall be in order  except on one day s notice in writing       New language  Any Senator may move to waive any or all points of order under this paragraph with respect to the pending conference report by an affirmative vote of three fifths of the Members  duly chosen and sworn  All motions to waive under this paragraph shall be debatable collectively for not to exceed 1 hour equally divided between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their designees  A motion to waive all points of order under this paragraph shall not be amendable    8  Requires all earmark certifications from Senators to be posted on the Internet within 48 hours after an earmark is placed into legislation or its accompanying report   INCLUDED IN SENATE PASSED BILL  YES   INCLUDED IN NEW BILL  NO    Background  The original language in the Senate passed bill required Member certifications to be made publicly available on the Internet no more than 48 hours after the inclusion of an earmark in legislation or an accompanying report  The new language  however  requires that disclosure to be made as soon as practicable  The lack of a firm deadline in the new bill increases the likelihood that this information will not be disclosed in time to allow the public to inspect all earmarks prior to consideration of legislation     Original language  Each committee shall maintain the written statements transmitted under subparagraph  a   The written statements transmitted under subparagraph  a  for any congressional earmarks  limited tax benefits  or limited tariff benefits included in any measure reported by the committee or conference report filed by the chairman of the committee or any subcommittee thereof shall be published in a searchable format on the committee s or subcommittee s website not later than 48 hours after receipt on such information     New language  With respect to each item included in a Senate bill or joint resolution  or accompanying report  reported by committee or considered by the Senate  or included in a conference report  or joint statement of managers accompanying the conference report  considered by the Senate  each committee of jurisdiction shall make available for public inspection on the Internet the certifications under subparagraph  a  5  as soon as practicable                                                                                                                                                                 9 488 543 052 750 00      31 090 20 Per Citizen
