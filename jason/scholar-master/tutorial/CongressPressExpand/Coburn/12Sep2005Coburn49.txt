                                                                 September 12  2005  WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D  today released the following transcript of his opening statement for the confirmation hearing of Judge John Roberts    Thank you  Mr  Chairman  It is a great honor to be here today to participate in the critically important job of selecting a new Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court  I want to congratulate Judge Roberts on his nomination  I have greatly enjoyed meeting with him and am highly impressed by his distinguished record   As we begin the confirmation process for one of the nine members of the highest court in this country  let me begin by saying that this process should not be divisive and politicized  Even more importantly  the Supreme Court should not become a political force that divides our Country  In other words  the Court should not take an activist role that moves it out of its appropriate Constitutional role  While we each have our own definition of judicial activism  essentially the Court will not become an activist court if it adheres to its appropriate role and does not attempt to legislate or create policy  In order to understand this concept  I believe that it behooves us to take a step back and look at the origin of the United States Judicial system    The most logical place to begin is the United States Constitution  The first sentences of Articles I  II  and III clearly delineate who holds the legislative  executive  and judicial powers in the federal government  respectively  Article I begins      a ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States  which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives     Article II begins      t he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America     Finally  Article III begins     t he judicial Power of the United States  shall be vested in one supreme Court  and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish     The roles of each branch of government could not be clearer    All legislative power belongs to the Congress  The judiciary is given no legislative role  It is also given no executive power  Because of these limitations  Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist Paper  78 that    the judiciary  from the nature of its functions  will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution  because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them     Hamilton further explained that the judiciary    has no influence over either the sword or the purse    and    must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments     He believed that it was incontestable    that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power     He was concerned that the judiciary needed to be protected from attacks by the executive or the legislative branches  not vice versa  However  Hamilton and the other founding fathers never anticipated an activist Judiciary like the one that has developed over recent decades    The bottom line is that our Founding Fathers created three coequal branches of government  Because of this system  no branch of government should ever be completely satisfied  There will always be  and should always be  checks on each branch of government  Yet  look where we are today  Decades of judicial activism have created huge rifts in the social fabric of our country  Activist judges have usurped Federal and State legislators    responsibility to make decisions on critically important issues  Ivory tower elites have decided that they can better make important decisions about our country   s social structure than the American people     It is time for judicial activism to stop  It is time that we have judges who understand their constitutional role  I am deeply heartened in that I have read many statements by Judge Roberts that indicate that he understands the proper role of judges  He does not appear to desire to be a super legislator  He understands how crucial it is that legislative bodies address important issues over which the public is sharply divided  and about which the Constitution is silent  He does not appear eager to turn to penumbras and invented substantive rights in order to promote his own policy agenda    Judge Roberts appears to be a judicious  intelligent  and ethical man  I look forward to hearing his opening statement and hearing his responses to our questions  I hope that all of my colleagues will afford him the respect that he deserves as a human being and as a sitting appellate judge who was approved unanimously by the United States Senate just over two years ago   The opportunity to sit on this committee at this time in our nation   s history will be among my most important tasks as an elected official  When I ponder our country and its greatness  its weaknesses  and its potential  my heart aches for less divisiveness  less polarization  less finger pointing  less bitterness and less mindless partisanship  which  at times  sounds almost hateful to the ears of ordinary Americans    The problems before our country are enormous  Our family structures have declined and our dependency on government has grown  The very heritage of America  which was born out of sacrifice by those who preceded us  is at extreme risk   We are all Americans  We all want the greatest future for the generations to come  protection for the innocent and frail  support for those less fortunate  But most of all  we want an America that will live on as a beacon of hope  freedom  kindness  and opportunity   I would hope that as we conduct these hearings over the next few days our tendency as politicians to be insensitive  bitter  discourteous  and political will surrender to the higher values that define America   We have an opportunity to lead by example and restore the values and principles that bind us together  How we conduct ourselves and how we treat Judge Roberts can be a great start toward reconciliation in our country   American is an idea  not just competing ideologies  I believe the genius of our founders is that they recognized that individual rights derive from a Creator  not from a King or the State  Our founders were concerned that if our rights derived from the State     or a Court     they could be taken away by the State or a Court  Our Constitution enshrines this idea and gives it meaning in the rule of law  This is why it is important for us to respect the Constitution    I want one America  an America that continues to be divided is an America at risk  Our Country waits for its leaders at all levels to rise to the occasion of rebuilding our future by placing political fortunes last and constitutional principles first  and working diligently to reconcile each and every American to the freedom and responsibility that our republic demands  May God bless our efforts
