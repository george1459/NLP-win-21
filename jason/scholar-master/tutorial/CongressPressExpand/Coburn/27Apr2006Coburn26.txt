          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      April 27  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  issued the following statement today regarding his vote against an amendment offered by Senator Daniel Akaka  D HI  to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill regarding funding for outpatient care and treatment for veterans  My support for veterans is unwavering and I believe keeping our commitment to those who risk all to fight for our freedom must be among the highest of our priorities  Unfortunately  the Akaka amendment was more about politicizing veterans issues rather than addressing their real health care needs  Dr  Coburn said  From the start of the fiscal year through March 2006  the number of patients the Veterans Administration  VA  has treated is higher than what the agency expected  according to the agency  But the facts clearly show the money spent by the VA on such care is only 71 percent of what was expected at this time  That means the agency currently has about  600 million budgeted for care that hasnt been spent  Coupled with a  430 million contingency fund built into the VAs budget  the agency has a  1 billion surplus at its disposal  Dr  Coburn said  VA officials also have told congressional leaders they do not need additional funding for veterans care at this time  The facts clearly show the Senate has approved more than enough money to meet the health care needs of these veterans  This move was more about politics than addressing the real health care needs of veterans  Its sad the Senate chose to add to the future debt of our children and grandchildren under the guise of supporting veterans  Dr  Coburn said  Dr  Coburn added that Congress improved the transparency of the VA budget process last year and the process has been a resounding success  This amendment would be a step backward in terms of Congress stewardship of taxpayer dollars   As a practicing physician  it has been my honor to have personally cared for hundreds of Oklahoma veterans  We can and must improve veterans health care by giving veterans greater control over the delivery of their care and by reducing costs  streamlining bureaucracy and encouraging the best medical practices  Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                             9 488 545 245 350 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
