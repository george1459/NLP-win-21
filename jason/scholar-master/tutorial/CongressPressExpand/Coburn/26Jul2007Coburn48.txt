                                                                Plan would provide access to health insurance for the uninsured  lower costs for all  and increase personal control of health care  July 26  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    Today  five Republican senators introduced the Every American Insured Health Act that would provide all Americans  regardless of age  income or employer  with access to affordable  high quality health insurance through the free market  The bill was introduced by U S  Senators Richard Burr  R North Carolina  and Bob Corker  R Tennessee  and co sponsored by U S  Senators Tom Coburn  M D   R Oklahoma   a practicing physician  Mel Martinez  R Florida   and Elizabeth Dole  R North Carolina   The plan provides an avenue to ensure all Americans have health care coverage thereby reducing the number of uninsured Americans and lowering health care costs for all citizens  The proposal gives every American the right and resources to purchase health care in the free market and encourages individuals to take control of their own health     As a practicing physician  I have seen the inequities of our health care system firsthand  The vast majority of those inequities have been created by third parties  government and health insurance bureaucrats  and politicians  This plan breaks that cycle by giving patients the right to choose their own plan  their own doctor and their own treatment  Dr  Coburn said     Supporters of government run  bureaucratic controlled health care have long advocated using an incremental approach to push all Americans into socialized medicine  beginning with children  Dr  Coburn added  For example  the proposed SCHIP expansion is a clarion call for government run  bureaucrat controlled health care  Rather than forcing our children to board a sinking ship  we can allow all Americans to buy their own boat  Our flat tax credit for health care gives every American the freedom to choose the health care plan that works best for them  not the plan that works best for their employer  a government bureaucrat or a politician in Washington  Senator Burr     One of my greatest fears is that continuing high health care costs will force companies to dump their employee health care plans and millions of Americans and their families will be left without health care insurance  We must prevent this dangerous scenario by giving individuals control over their health care so they do not have to rely on their employers or the government for their health care  The Every American Insured Health Act does just that  Burr said  Personal freedom means owning your own health care without the fear of losing your job  your employer taking your insurance away  or being forced into a government run health care plan  We encourage all Americans to own their own homes  so why dont we encourage people to own their own health care  Burr added     This plan would ensure every American has access to affordable  quality health insurance through the free market  Under this plan  the millions of American who are currently uninsured would have access to coverage in the free market  The Every American Insured Health Act provides every American with a refundable  advanceable flat tax credit of  2 160 per individual and  5 400 per family that gives them the freedom to choose the health care plan that best meets their needs  The plan is budget neutral and puts an end to unfair discrimination in the IRS tax code that only benefits health coverage offered by employers and that disproportionately subsidizes Americans with more costly health plans and with higher incomes  Burr said     The plan also improves health insurance affordability in state marketplaces by turning patients into shoppers and giving them buying power  As millions of uninsured Americans purchase coverage for the first time  health care costs for all Americans will decline  The Every American Insured Health Act also creates the pathway for statewide insurance pools to reduce costs and help high risk individuals access affordable coverage  Burr added     Senator Corker     I believe the concept were introducing with this legislation should be at the center of a meaningful debate on true  broad health care and tax reform  Corker said  It provides all individuals access to health insurance that is both affordable and portable  It is a stepping stone to what I believe is the right direction for our country  a health care system that provides individuals the ability to purchase health insurance  that is deeply rooted in the private market  and is accessible to all Americans  Hard working families in Tennessee and across our country are without health care coverage because it is simply too expensive  and we have a moral obligation to address this issue now  The concept were introducing offers one way of addressing a complex problem that deserves vigorous debate in the U S  Senate     Senator Martinez     Its time for a major debate on health care insurance  Not enough people have access to affordable healthcare and the Congress has not done enough about this crisis  The bill were introducing today opens the debate on making health insurance more affordable and accessible to all Americans  Martinez said  Our aim is to remove inequities in our tax laws and make tax relief for health insurance available to everyone  This reform creates a free market for healthcare and empowers people with the right to choose their own plans  Giving Floridians and all Americans the peace of mind that healthcare is accessible and affordable will be an incredible breakthrough     Key provisions of the Every American Insured Health Act   Give every American the resources and the right to purchase health care in a free market  End the tax code discrimination against those who cannot get insurance through their employer by giving a flat tax break to every American  Encourage individuals to take control and become smart about their health insurance  Eliminate the current cost shift in the health care market that drives up costs for everyone  Ensure peace of mind about affordable  high quality health insurance for all Americans
