          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      December 18  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  and Jim DeMint  R SC   and U S  Representatives John Shadegg  R AZ   Jeb Hensarling  R TX  and John Campbell  R CA  today called on President Bush to keep his commitment to cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half     In his 2007 State of the Union address  President Bush said   Next  there is the matter of earmarks  These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour  when not even C SPAN is watching  In 2005 alone  the number of earmarks grew to over 13 000 and totaled nearly  18 billion  Even worse  over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate  they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk  You didn t vote them into law  I didn t sign them into law  Yet  they re treated as if they have the force of law  The time has come to end this practice  So let us work together to reform the budget process  expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress  and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session     President Bush was wise to challenge Congress to scale back what has become known as the  earmark favor factory  in Washington  Special interest earmarks divert billions of dollars from higher priority needs and undermine public confidence in Congress  which is at an all time low  President Bush should veto this bloated spending bill and force members of Congress to sacrifice some of their pet projects for higher priorities  For instance  few Americans would support spending  213 000 for olive fruit fly research in France ahead of spending that same sum to support our troops  repair dangerous bridges or provide health care for kids  Dr  Coburn said     Moreover  the presence of 9 170 earmarks in this bill has created a powerful incentive for members of both parties to look the other way in the face of budget gimmicks and accounting shenanigans that are hiding unknown billions in additional spending above the President s request  Dr  Coburn added     According to the earmark baseline developed by the Office of Management and Budget  OMB   there were 13 492 appropriations earmarks in fiscal year 2005  Thus  in order to meet the president s 50 percent reduction  Congress could not pass more than 6 476 earmarks for fiscal year 2008     Yet  the 2008 omnibus spending bill contains 9 170 earmarks in the 2008 omnibus spending bill  This total  in addition to the 2 161 earmarks in the 2008 defense spending bill  none of which were requested by the Pentagon   bring this year s earmark total to 11 331 earmarks for 2008  a mere 16 percent reduction compared to OMB s baseline of 13 492 earmarks in 2005   Note  all earmark estimates exclude earmarks requested by the White House      In terms of total cost  this year s earmark total may exceed the total from 2005 when Congress passed nearly  18 billion in earmarks     Notable earmarks in the 2008 omnibus spending bill include     Rodent control in Alaska   113 000    Olive fruit fly research in France   213 000    Hunting and Fishing Museum in Pennsylvania   200 000    Louis Armstrong Museum in New York   150 000    A bike trail in Minnesota   700 000    A river walk in Massachusetts   1 000 000    A post office museum in downtown Las Vegas   200 000   and   The Lincoln Park Zoo in Illinois   37 000     Once again  Democrats have broken their promises  Democrats promised to cut earmarks in half  but this bill doesn t even come close  In fact  this omnibus could spend more on pork than any appropriations bill in history  Americans want us to end the wasteful and corrupting earmark system that helps special interests at the expense of taxpayers  This bill is earmark business as usual and it deserves to be rejected  Sen  DeMint said     No American taxpayer should tolerate Members of Congress spending hard earned tax dollars on pet projects that benefit their cronies or seek to buy themselves back into office  Yet  once again  this bill demonstrates that is exactly what the Congress is doing  Every reform promise has proven hollow  The President should veto this bill and demand an end to self serving Congressional corruption  Rep  Shadegg said     Despite claims that they were going to clean up the pork  Democrats produced a massive spending bill that contains nearly 700 pages of 9 000 plus earmarks  Worse  Democrats are forcing members to vote on these earmarks without allowing any time to investigate their merit  Though not all these earmarks will be bad  it is clear that once again the earmarking process has lent itself to the triumph of seniority over merit  secrecy over transparency  and the special interest over the national interest  That alone would be reason enough to veto the bill  The nation would be far better off with a Continuing Resolution than passing a 3 000 page  rammed down your throat spending bill chock full of uninvestigated earmarks  Rep  Hensarling said     This omnibus bill still spends too much  includes over 9 000 earmarks  is loaded with accounting gimmicks  and members of Congress were given 24 hours to review all 3 000 pages of it  I urge the President to veto it  Rep  Campbell said
