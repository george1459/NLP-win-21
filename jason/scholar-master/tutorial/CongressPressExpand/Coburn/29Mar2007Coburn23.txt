          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      March 29  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement today regarding his vote against H R  1591  the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans  Health  and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007  The bill passed by a vote of 51 to 47  The Senate did accept by voice vote a Coburn amendment eliminating a  2 million earmark for the University of Vermont that was offered by Senator Patrick Leahy  D VT  as a tribute to former U S  Senator James Jeffords     Handing our enemies a timeline for withdrawal gives them a date certain for victory  The terrorists understand the stakes in Iraq  it is unfortunate that the Senate does not  The terrorists are waging a relentless war to destroy the fledgling democracy in Iraq precisely because our mission in Iraq is a vital front in the war on terror  Moreover  the generals on the ground who are vastly more knowledgeable about the topic do not want such a timeline  Dr  Coburn said     We dont need 100 Secretaries of State or 100 armchair generals in the Senate  Dr  Coburn added  What we need are 100 senators who will do what they were elected to do  which is to make difficult decisions between competing priorities  If senators dont want the war in Iraq to continue  for instance  they should defund it  not micromanage it     The abuse of Congress emergency spending rules in this bill was unprecedented  Dr  Coburn continued  Never before has Congress claimed that the costs associated with the presidential conventions  which have happened every four years since 1832  were unforeseen emergencies     Dr  Coburn explained that in the past decade both parties have habitually abused Congress emergency spending rules in order to evade budget caps  Emergency spending is like an emergency credit card that borrows money from future generations and does not count against Congress annual budget caps  Designating spending as an emergency enables members of Congress to spend more money than they otherwise could if they had to cut spending elsewhere in order to pay for new programs or priorities     The American people voted for change in the last election  Unfortunately  they are getting more of the same political bribery that put Jack Abramoff and members of Congress in prison  Dr  Coburn said in reference to the special interest spending that was used to bribe members to vote for the flawed Iraq withdrawal timeline     The Senate did accept by a voice vote a Coburn amendment that stripped a  2 million earmark to set up an institute at the University of Vermont named after former Senator James Jeffords  Senator Leahy said the earmark could be considered an emergency because of Jeffords failing health     My heart goes out to not only former Senator Jeffords and his family  but to every American with failing health and their families as well  However  it is imperious to suggest that the only individual Americans with failing health that deserve special treatment in an emergency supplemental bill are former senators  I applaud Senator Leahy for wanting to honor his friend and colleague but this is not an appropriate way to do so  particularly when the University of Vermont has received just over  400 million in federal grants since 2000  Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                            9 488 539 267 110 00      31 090 19 Per Citizen
