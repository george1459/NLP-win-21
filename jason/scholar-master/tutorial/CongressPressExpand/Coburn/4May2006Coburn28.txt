          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      May 4  2006   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   today released the following statement on his vote against the emergency supplemental bill approved by the Senate  The bill  H R  4939  passed by a margin of 78  20  Im delighted President Bush has pledged to veto this bill because Congress has  once again  been unable to resist the temptation to load up a must pass bill with pork  Dr  Coburn said  Many of the items in this bill are obviously not emergencies  which is why Im confident the President will veto this bill in its current form  Some would argue the Presidents priorities dont come down from heaven  I would suggest  however  that we are all subject to the judgment that comes down from the taxpayers  If we flippantly disregard the Presidents insistence that we make hard choices  the judgment of the taxpayers will not be kind to any of us  Dr  Coburn said  Recent polls indicated that the American people are following the debate about spending and earmarks very closely  In a recent Wall Street Journal NBC poll  39 percent of Americans said ending earmarks should be the number one priority of Congress this session  Earmark reform was ranked ahead of immigration reform in this poll  Thirty two percent of Americans said immigration reform should be Congress top priority  Congress overall approval rating is also at a very low 22 percent  In this time of war and disaster recovery  the American people expect us to make hard choices about spending  Taxpayers want us to be serving in a spirit of service and sacrifice  not searching for new ways to raid the public treasury  All of the money in this bill will be borrowed and go directly to our national debt  The American people are tired of the federal government using Enron style accounting schemes that hide the true cost of stealing from our grandchildren so politicians can stay in power today  Dr  Coburn said  Families across this country are faced with hard choices every day in order to live within their budgets  They have elected to us to make hard choices  Our refusal to do this only reinforces the perception we are disconnected from the priority setting reality that governs the rest of the country  Dr  Coburn added  Where this body sees an emergency the taxpayers often see a series of misplaced priorities  For example  the state of California received 549 federal earmarks this year worth  733 million  which included  10 million in earmarks for museums  Yet  our failure to plan and make choices forced the next generation to finance an  11 million repair to a levee in Sacramento  Is it more important to protect the residents at risk from flooding by the Sacramento River or to fund museums  Congress cant have it both ways  Dr  Coburn said  Dr  Coburn offered an amendment  divided into 19 sections  to strip non emergency projects from this emergency supplemental bill  An amendment to block a  700 million economic development project in Mississippi failed by a vote of 47  50  An amendment to block a  500 million corporate welfare benefit package for Northrop Grumman  a major defense contractor  failed by a vote of 48  51  One Coburn amendment to remove  15 million for seafood promotion strategies was accepted by the Senate by a vote of 51  44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         9 488 545 279 610 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
