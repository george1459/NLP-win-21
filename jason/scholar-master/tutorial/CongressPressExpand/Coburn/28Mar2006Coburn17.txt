          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Votes for cloture  Wyden amendment protect culture of secrecy in Senate  keep pork on the menu March 28  2006  WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Tom Coburn  R OK  released the following statement tonight after voting against a move to cut off debate on lobbying reform legislation  S  2349  and an amendment offered by U S  Senator Ron Wyden  D OR  that enhances the ability of Senators to pass millions in pork spending in the middle of the night  The motion to invoke cloture on S  2349 passed by a vote 81 to 16  The Wyden Amendment passed by a margin of 84 to 13       The Senate   s decision tonight to silence the debate on lobbying reform without considering earmark reform has turned this process into a charade  When disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff described Congress as an    earmark favor factory    most Americans were reminded that earmarks are key aspect of the culture of corruption in Washington  The Senate   s willingness to ignore this connection illustrates the degree to which many career politicians are disconnected from reality  I fear that the process of reconnecting to reality will be especially painful for many politicians come November     Dr  Coburn said      I suspect the American people will not consider banning former members from the House gym or outlawing  25 lunches as trust building exercises when the Senate does nothing to reform the process that helped put a former member of Congress  Duke Cunningham  in prison  The tragic episode of Rep  Cunningham trading favors for pork projects showed the public how earmarks are the gateway drug or currency of corruption in Congress     Dr  Coburn added     Keeping earmarks out of this debate is like keeping alcohol off the agenda of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting         Since the Senate has decided earmark reform was not worthy of debate in the context of lobbying reform I am convinced that the American people  now more than ever  deserve an extended and thorough debate on each individual earmark or pork project Senators propose this year     Dr  Coburn said   The Senate tonight also voted for an amendment that cracks down on Senators who wish to place holds on  or block  legislation they wish to review further      The Wyden amendment is an attack against the right of every Senator to block bad legislation and limit the growth of government  As a personal policy  I don   t place secret holds  I tell members directly when I have a hold on their legislation  Yet  holds are an important tool that allows a single Senator to stop new spending measures from being steamrolled through the Senate  The current process of slipping pork projects into bills in the middle of the night unless a Senator is around to place a hold is indefensible  Holds help ensure that elected Senators  not unelected staff  have more than 5 or 10 minutes to read the bills they are being asked to support     Dr  Coburn said      Senators should be allowed time to review legislation without being bombarded by lobbyists  other politicians and administration officials who want to ram another spending bill through Congress  The Senate is not the House  where members are routinely strong armed on the floor  The Wyden amendment has taken the Senate even further from the path of real reform     Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             9 488 545 108 310 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
