          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      May 25  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today voted against a Senate immigration bill  S  2611  that would grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants without providing adequate safeguards to protect our borders  The American people have been demanding that their elected officials take action to limit illegal immigration first by securing our borders  then by addressing guest worker reform  Unfortunately  this bill reversed those priorities  Rewarding illegal immigrants with amnesty without taking adequate steps to secure our borders is the wrong way to address this problem  Dr  Coburn said   America is a welcoming nation that was built by immigrants  but it is also a nation governed by the rule of law  Rewarding illegal immigrants with a clear path to citizenship and voting rights is unfair to the millions of individuals who immigrated to this country legally  This approach will also make the problem of illegal immigration worse  which is precisely what happened after Congress passed a similar law in 1986  Dr  Coburn said  It is impossible for Congress to accurately assess our need for guest workers before we have taken the steps necessary to secure our borders  It is important for Congress to understand that the public will not trust us on this issue until our borders are secure  Once we take that step  I believe the American people would support a compassionate and common sense plan for dealing with our need for guest workers and the 12 million illegal immigrants who are already here  Dr  Coburn said   The Senate today also voted to weaken a provision Dr  Coburn added in the Judiciary Committee that would have made it easier for federal officials to deport illegal immigrants who had committed crimes  Each year  the Oklahoma prison system spends an estimated  11 7 million to incarcerate illegal criminal immigrants    Top Ten Reasons to Oppose The Senate Amnesty Bill 1  Rewards Illegal Behavior with Clear Path to Citizenship and Voting Rights  Amnesty  As noted by former Attorney General Ed Meese in the New York Times on May 24  2006  Like the amnesty bill of 1986  the current Senate proposal would place those who have resided illegally in the United States on a path to citizenship  provided they meet a similar set of conditions and pay a fine and back taxes  The illegal immigrant does not go to the back of the line but gets immediate legalized status  while law abiding applicants wait in their home countries for years to even get here  And that s the line that counts  In the end  slight differences in process do not change the overriding fact that the 1986 law and today s bill are both amnesties    2  Creates Temporary Worker Program That is Neither Temporary Nor Work Based   The bills guest worker program would allow millions of illegal immigrants to qualify for permanent green cards within four years  Additionally  the Senate approved Senator Kennedys amendment that each year would allow up to 200 000 immigrants who cross the border illegally and work just 6 days a year  including self employment  to qualify for a permanent green card     3  Unprecedented Wave of Immigrants   66 Million Over 20 Years  This bill is estimated to skyrocket the number of immigrants  from its current level of 19 million over the next 20 years  to an unprecedented number  Heritage Foundation      O ur estimate of the number of legal immigrants who would enter the country or would gain legal status under S  2611   would be  66 million over the next 20 years     4  Insufficient Border Security  The Senate rejected an amendment by Senator Isakson that would have prohibited the implementation of any guest worker program that grants legal status to those who have entered the country illegally until the Secretary of Homeland Security has certified to the President and to the Congress that the border security provisions in the immigration legislation are fully funded and operational     5  Terrorist Loophole Disarms Law Enforcement  Heritage Foundation reported May 24  2006  The Senates immigration reform proposal  would restrict local police to arresting aliens for criminal violations of immigration law only  not civil violations  The results would be disastrous  All of the hijackers on  9 11  who committed immigration violations committed civil violations  Under the bill  police officers would have no power to arrest such terrorists     6  Social Security Benefits  Tax Credits for Illegal Work  The Senate rejected Senator Ensigns amendment that would have prevented Social Security benefits from being awarded to immigrants for time that they worked illegally in the United States  If the immigration compromise bill before the Senate were enacted into law  an estimated 12 million illegal workers would be able to use their past illegal work to qualify for Social Security benefits   Provisions in S  2611 would require newly legalized immigrants to file tax returns for work they performed while in the U S  illegally  And while some would be required to pay back taxes  many others could qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit  which has a maximum payout of  4 400 per year     7  Costs Over  50 Billion A Year to Federal Government  States Foot The Bill for Immigrant Health Care  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation described the bill as a fiscal catastrophe  and has said the measure would prove to be the largest expansion of government welfare in 35 years  According to Rector  the bill would increase long term federal spending by at least  50 billion a year   The Senate bill does not reimburse state and local governments for health care and education costs related to the millions of undocumented immigrants  While the underlying bill creates a state impact assistance account for future temporary workers  it is an unfunded account     8  Hurts Small Business  The Senate approved an amendment by Sen  Obama extending Davis Bacon prevailing wage provisions for guest workers  but not American citizens  in all occupations covered by Davis Bacon  currently limited to federally paid work   Small businesses would be forced to pay inflated wages to guest workers above the pay American citizens receive for performing the same work     9  Gives Some Immigrant Workers Greater Job Protection Than American Workers  As reported by Robert Novak of Chicago Sun Times on May 24  2006  The bill supposedly would protect American workers by ensuring that new immigrants would not take away jobs  However  the bill s definition of United States worker includes temporary foreign guest workers  so the protection is meaningless Foreign guest farm workers  admitted under the bill  cannot be terminated from employment by any employer     except for just cause  In contrast  American ag workers can be fired for any reason     10  Weak Assimilation English Requirements  The Senate approved the Inhofe amendment to make English the national language and require those seeking citizenship to demonstrate English proficiency and understanding of U S  History  However  a far weaker amendment by Sen  Salazar gutted the Inhofe amendment  leaving it in doubt  and also giving immigrants the right to demand the federal government communicate with them in any language they choose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 488 545 365 250 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
