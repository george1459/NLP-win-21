          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Offers 166 amendments to improve bill in committee February 15  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement today regarding his decision to offer 166 amendments to S  4  a bill to purportedly implement unfinished recommendations of the 9 11 Commission     Im disappointed that this bill  in its current form  appears to have more to do with enhancing the political security of politicians than the physical security of the American people  Giving senators limited time to review a bill as complex as this suggests the Senate is more interested in creating the appearance of accomplishment than improving our homeland security  I hope my amendments will give my colleagues and the American people ample time to study this bills provisions and to improve it as needed  Dr  Coburn said     Dr  Coburns 166 amendments are designed primarily to produce a bill that 1  is based on risk rather than perceived political rewards  and 2  avoids creating unnecessary duplication and bureaucracy     Im concerned that this duplicative and bureaucratic legislation solves problems that do not exist while ignoring problems that do  Im also troubled that Congress conveniently omitted itself from the 9 11 Commissions list of government bodies that need to be reformed  Dr  Coburn said  In particular  Im unable to reconcile this bills preoccupation with delivering to each state its fair share of homeland security grant funding with the 9 11 Commissions statement that  Congress should not use this money as a pork barrel  Our enemies would like nothing more than for Congress to base our security decisions not on reason and risk  but on parochial political interests     One Coburn amendment would eliminate funding for the Office for the Prevention of Terrorism     I believe many Americans will ask why we need a new Office for the Prevention of Terrorism when some might argue we already have such offices  including the Office of the President  the Department of Defense  the Department of Homeland Security or the Central Intelligence Agency  This effort to create an obviously duplicative office demonstrates that this is a hastily and ill conceived bill  Dr  Coburn said     Dr  Coburn also has offered 32 amendments to prohibit the use of grant monies for non security related activities that have been funded through the Department of Homeland Security  Activities or entities that shall not receive funding include yoga  art class  dance  bingo  theater workshops  gardens and parks  which have little to no deterrent or security value in the global war against terrorism     Congress has a lot of catch up work to do in homeland security oversight  Unfortunately  this bill ignores ongoing problems while creating opportunities for further mismanagement  Dr  Coburn said  I also share Secretary Chertoffs concern that we are rushing to approve new grants programs when we have  5 billion in unspent grant funds     I appreciate the hard work Senators Lieberman and Collins have devoted to this bill  and their serious commitment to protecting the lives of the American people  I regret that some are urging this committee to follow a political timetable rather than a common sense policy timetable  The Senate should step back from this bill  hold an adequate number of hearings  which has not occurred  and produce a bill that will help secure the American people  not just our standing in the polls  Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        9 488 539 044 420 00      31 090 19 Per Citizen
