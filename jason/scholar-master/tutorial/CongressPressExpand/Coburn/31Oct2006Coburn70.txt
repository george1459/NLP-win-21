          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Says putting Congress in charge of research  as head of National Breast Cancer Coalition advocates  would compromise science and delay cures October 31  2006     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   a practicing physician  released the following statement urging his Senate colleagues to resist calls from special interest groups to take research authority away from scientists and put it in the hands of politicians     Federal research dollars should go to the science that will save the most lives  not the lobbyists or politicians who make the most noise  Bills like S  757 that would take research authority away from scientists at the National Institutes of Health and put it in the hands of members of the congressional appropriations committees would set a dangerous precedent  Dr  Coburn said     The lobbying campaign led by former Clinton appointee and president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition  Fran Visco  has crossed a line with its distortions and attack ad style rhetoric  Dr  Coburn added  Suggesting that I want to see women drop dead of breast cancer  as Visco wrote in a blog  or claiming that breast cancer is not part of my world are uninformed personal attacks against my patients and my family     I have had family members die of breast cancer  I currently have a sister and sister in law with breast cancer  I am a practicing physician who has treated women with breast cancer  I am also a two time cancer survivor  Viscos vitriolic rhetoric is an embarrassment to the breast cancer victims she claims to represent  Organizations like the National Breast Cancer Coalition should serve breast cancer victims and sound science  not the personal partisan political agenda of its leader  Dr  Coburn said     According to Federal Election Committee records  Visco has contributed thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates like Hillary Clinton  Al Gore and John Kerry since 1999 but has not contributed to any Republicans  In 2004  Visco was paid  184 867 to represent the interests of all breast cancer victims  both Democrat and Republican     My office has clearly expressed my concerns with S  757 to Visco and her organization  contrary to her claim that she does not understand why I oppose its passage by unanimous consent  I have also clearly communicated to her organization that I will support this legislation if one word in the bill was changed to say that NIH may conduct this research instead of dictating that they shall conduct this research  S  757 is politics driving research instead of the NIHs peer reviewed process driving research  Dr  Coburn said     The fact is  NIH already has the authority to study possible environmental causes of breast cancer and is conducting that research to the tune of  100 million per year  Its also important to note that the  690 million NIH is spending every year on all forms of breast cancer research is almost twice as much as any other area of cancer research  Colon cancer  for example  claims 40 percent more lives every year than breast cancer but we spend nearly twice as much on breast cancer research  Dr  Coburn said     Everyone with cancer deserves research that can save the most lives with the best use of research dollars  whether its an adult with breast cancer or a 4 year old with leukemia  Dr  Coburn said  However  when Congress picks winners and losers on the basis of politics  not science  cures are delayed and all Americans suffer  The bottom line is that this bill does nothing that isnt already being done  but allows Washington politicians running for re election and lobbyists to take credit for the research that we are already funding  Dr  Coburn said     Dr  Coburn added that it is dishonest to suggest that he is single handedly blocking a bill that has unanimous support in Congress  U S  Representative Joe Barton  R TX   Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee  who also opposes the legislation  has said  We have to say let the NIH be the NIH and stop attempting to micromanage  even with the best of intentions     I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the next Congress on finding ways to promote sound cancer research  such as legislation  H R  6164  that will modernize NIH  As the composition of the Senate changes next year and new members focus on breast cancer research and all forms of cancer research I hope science will prevail over politics  Dr  Coburn said     As a member of the House of Representatives  Dr  Coburn supported doubling NIHs budget  co sponsored the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act that ensures treatment for women diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer  and was one of only 10 co sponsors of the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act that raised  35 million for breast cancer research
