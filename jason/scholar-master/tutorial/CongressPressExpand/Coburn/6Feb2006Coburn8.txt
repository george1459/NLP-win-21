          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      February 6  2006  CHICAGO  IL      At a hearing today held in Chicago  U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  said billions of dollars each year are wasted on unused federal property    Senators Tom Carper  D DE  and Barack Obama  D IL  joined Dr  Coburn at the field hearing titled     Big Ticket Waste  Are Empty Federal Buildings Emptying the Taxpayers    Wallets          In a time of rising deficits  wars and natural disasters  it is unconscionable for the federal government to waste billions of dollars on unused property     Dr  Coburn said  At a minimum  the total cost of the federal government   s unused real estate property assets worldwide is a staggering  15 billion or one third the total amount of the state of Illinois    fiscal year 2006 budget   43 57 billion      The government   s property holdings total  320 billion  Given a federal workforce of 4 1 million civilian and uniformed personnel  means the government is putting an  80 000 roof over every single federal employee   s head  Put another way  the federal government owns more than 2 8 billion square feet of building space     meaning each federal employee is housed with almost 700 square feet of office space  while the private industry standard is 250 square feet        Taxpayers are losing billions of dollars each year as Congress continues to pay holding costs for vacant buildings instead of demanding they be sold or demolished  I applaud my colleague from Illinois  Senator Obama  as well as Senator Carper  for working with me across the aisle to solve a problem that any person of common sense should see as unacceptable     Dr  Coburn said    Prior to the hearing  Dr  Coburn and Senators Carper and Obama toured the    poster child    for this problem  the former Main Post Office in Chicago which contains 2 5 million square feet of unused property  Holding costs for this facility exceed  2 million annually and it has been vacant since 1997       Wasted  unnecessary federal space isn   t just a nuisance  or an eye sore  or a wasted opportunity  It   s actually robbing the country of what we should be getting for our money  But it   s not just us being robbed     Dr Coburn said     When you consider the unsustainable growth of programs like Social Security and Medicare  and the promises we won   t be able to afford to keep for our children and grandchildren  then the waste is actually robbing future generations of their quality of life          Not all the blame  however  can be laid on the agencies     Dr  Coburn said     The statutory hoops an agency must jump through in order to get rid of property make it almost impossible to dump a property and they create a slew of disincentives to do so       For instance  once an agency decides it wants to get rid of a facility  it has to offer the building up  potentially at a loss for the taxpayers  to non profit groups for public use  If it no entity purchases the building  then the agency has to make discounted offers to local and state governments  Then  and only then  can the agency sell the building at market rates  When it does so  the agency will appropriately have to put the money from the sale into the federal treasury rather than stuffing its own pockets       Under these conditions  it   s easy to see why agencies procrastinate addressing the serious problem of wasted and unnecessary facilities  Taxpayers and their representatives in Congress must demand action     Dr  Coburn said     Every American family understands when they sell their home  they will be able to use the profit to meet other needs or to invest in a different home  Americans should demand no less common sense in their government   s financial management than they would in the management of their own households                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 9 488 544 748 590 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
