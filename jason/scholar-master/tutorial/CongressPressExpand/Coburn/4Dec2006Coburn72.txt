          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Says Politicians Stealing Critical Ag Dollars to Pay for Earmarks December 4  2006     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement concerning the fiscal year 2007 agriculture appropriations bill     This legislation is a bailout for politicians  not American farmers  Politicians in Washington  D C   are using farmers as political cover for their wasteful and deceptive spending practices  The hundreds of earmarks hidden throughout this bill will siphon millions of dollars from critical programs designed to protect our food supply  enhance agricultural production  and directly assist farmers  Dr  Coburn said     Between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2006  the number of earmarks in the agricultural appropriations bill has increased by 92 percent  Among the more egregious earmarks in the 2007 spending bill are  3 7 million to study termites in Hawaii and  2 million to study seafood waste and its possible use as a pet food or other alternative products     Also  the legislation redirects hundreds of thousands of dollars in research funds for the Agricultural Research Service to the World Food Prize  a group which boasts  2 million cash on hand and another  14 million in stock assets  The bill also redirects funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS   the countrys front line of defense against everything from avian flu to Mad Cow Disease  to an animal breeding program at the Chicago Zoo     Additionally  Dr  Coburn said some are trying to use the agriculture spending bill as a vehicle to add so called emergency aid that will not directly benefit most farmers  The emergency aid package contains more than  300 million for small business grants   6 million for Hawaiian sugar beet growers and  20 million for additional Farm Service Administration  FSA  employees to administer the emergency aid  Dr  Coburn also noted the U S  Department of Agriculture has more than  8 billion in unobligated balances     I believe we should help the farmers who need assistance but we shouldnt ask the next generation of Americans to pay for it when there are many places in the federal budget to find savings  Rather than add new money or non emergency programs to an emergency aid package  Congress should be making the tough choices about spending now  Dr  Coburn said     Dr  Coburn also noted that those farmers who took precautions  bought federal crop insurance but were unable to plant crops should be the primary recipients of disaster aid     Once its paid for in the federal budget  emergency aid should go directly to farmers impacted by disasters rather than special interests groups in Washington  Dr  Coburn said     Also  Oklahoma farmers should know it is likely H R  503  a bill to end the practice of horse slaughter  likely will be attached to any agriculture spending bill considered by the Senate     I oppose any efforts to ban horse slaughtering as a last alternative  Though I dont want to see any horses being slaughtered  it must remain an option for horses that arent granted proper care and for which all other options have been exhausted  Dr  Coburn said    The American Veterinary Medical Association  the American Quarterhorse Association and the American Association of Equine Practitioners oppose the horse bill  Under the passage of H R  503  as many as 90 000 horses could be abandoned                                                                                                                                                                               9 488 546 256 000 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
