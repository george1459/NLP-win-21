          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      May 11  2005  Since being elected to the U S  Senate I have been urging my colleagues to permanently end the unprecedented filibustering of President Bush   s judicial nominees  as I pledged to do during my campaign  In the very near future  actions by some of the Senate   s chief obstructionists will likely force Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  to formally restore long standing Constitutional and Senate traditions regulating judicial confirmations   For the first 214 years of our nation   s history  the president has been able to nominate judges and expect that those nominees would receive the courtesy of a straight up or down vote on the floor of the Senate  During this time  the Senate operated within its Constitutional    advice and consent    role  The president would nominate judges of his choice with advice from the Senate  The Senate would then either consent and confirm that nominee by a majority vote or reject that nominee   In 2003  however  obstructionist senators decided the system that was designed by our founders and practiced for 214 years was no longer fair  If the minority didn   t like the judicial philosophy of one of President Bush   s nominees they concluded it was their right to deny them the courtesy of an up or down vote through a filibuster  Instead of needing 51 votes to be confirmed  the minority unilaterally declared that judges who failed their liberal litmus test would need 60 votes to break their filibuster  Never before in American history has a judicial nominee with clear majority support been denied an up or down vote   In order to defend this unprecedented partisan power grab  the minority is using a series of profoundly hypocritical arguments that rely on revisionist history   First  nine senators  who are among the minority   s most strident defenders of the judicial filibuster  voted in 1995 to ban the use of all filibusters     against legislation or judges   Second  the minority often speaks as if the right to filibuster judges was at the forefront of James Madison   s mind when he helped draft the Constitution  However  the concept of the filibuster is not even mentioned in the Constitution  What is in the Constitution is a provision that allows the Senate to set its own rules and on numerous occasions senators have modified the concept of the filibuster  In 1917  the Senate decided that 67 senators could vote to cut off debate  In 1975  that number was reduced to 60  Through these changes  the Republic endured   It is important to note  however  that what Senator Frist is proposing is not even a formal rules change  He is considering using a parliamentary maneuver that would essentially restore a 214 year old precedent with a new precedent  This    restorative precedent    would only need a simple majority vote to pass  Another irony in this debate is that one of the most strident defenders of judicial filibusters  Senator Robert Byrd  D WV   himself used precisely the same parliamentary maneuver Senator Frist is considering on four occasions when he was majority leader  In my view  the    Byrd Option    is the best title for Senator Frist   s proposal to set a precedent with a simple majority vote   Senator Frist   s effort would leave the legislative filibuster untouched  All that would be rendered illegitimate is the previous two years of shenanigans by obstructionists who were disappointed with recent elections and want to protect  at any cost  the ability of liberal academics  activists  and wealthy donors to enact an agenda through the courts that has been repeatedly defeated at the ballot box   My friends and neighbors in Oklahoma understand what is at stake in this debate  This debate ultimately is not about arcane Senate rules and procedures  it is about an increasingly fierce clash of ideas in our nation that transcend party and ideology   Americans are aware of the very strong possibility that President Bush will nominate at least one person to the Supreme Court in the next four years  The public understands that the most important swearing in ceremonies that occur in Washington are not always for presidents  Judges  not presidents or legislators  have settled some of the most important questions in our nation and will continue to do so in the near future   I will continue to insist that the judicial nominations from any president     Republican or Democrat     receive the courtesy of an up or down vote  A shrill minority should not be allowed to run out the clock on a president who opposes the practice of judicial activism
