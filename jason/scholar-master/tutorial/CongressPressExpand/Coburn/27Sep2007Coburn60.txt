          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      September 27  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  released the following statement tonight after voting against a measure to increase the federal debt limit by nearly 10 percent  or  850 billion  from  8 965 trillion to  9 815 trillion     We are increasing our debt limit by nearly a trillion dollars because the President and both parties in Congress have failed to make tough choices between competing priorities  Families across America dont have the luxury of loaning themselves new money when they have maxed out their credit  By raising the debt limit  and blaming everyone but itself  Congress has helped earn its all time low approval rating of 11 percent  Dr  Coburn said     Every child that is born today owes more than  400 000 as their share of our governments unfunded liabilities  Congress and future presidents will continue to raise the debt limit and imperil our future until the American people say enough and force their elected officials to do what they do every day  which is to make choices and live within their means  Dr  Coburn said     Congress has increased the debt limit six times since 1997  At the same time  earmark spending has skyrocketed  Between 1996 and 2006  the cost of earmarks more than tripled  increasing from  19 5 billion to  64 billion  according to the Congressional Research Service     Instead of working to reduce the national debt  Congress has instead chosen to gorge itself on pork projects like peace gardens and bike paths  The President could have restrained Congress in this area but he did not offer the Bridge to Nowhere and other egregious projects  The American people understand the principle that whoever is unfaithful with a little will be unfaithful with much  If we hope to earn the level of trust that will be required to address our massive unfunded liabilities in Medicare and Social Security we have to begin by showing some restraint in the smaller areas of our budget  Dr  Coburn said     For this reason  Im especially disappointed that only weeks after passing brand new ethics laws  the Senate has now decided that it is okay to add new earmarks to conference reports and that it is okay to hide the identities of earmark recipients from American voters and taxpayers  Instead of spending its time trying to figure out how to continue to raid the federal treasury without getting caught  Congress should do its job and make choices that will serve the next generation  not either partys fortunes in the next election  Dr  Coburn said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         9 488 543 224 050 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
