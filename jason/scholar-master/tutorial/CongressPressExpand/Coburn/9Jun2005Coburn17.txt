          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      June 9  2005  WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today released the following statement on the long delayed approval of three of President Bush   s judicial nominees  Priscilla Owen  Janice Rogers Brown and William Pryor      For the moment  justice and fairness have prevailed in the Senate  Three of President Bush   s long delayed judicial nominees have finally received the courtesy of an up or down vote         The debate about these three judges  however  is merely a prelude to a battle over a Supreme Court nominee  If this debate is any indication  the tone of that debate will be perhaps the most shrill and disingenuous discussion in our nation   s history         The compromise that led to the approval of these three judges proves that many of the accusations leveled against them were arbitrary  Judges who were considered unfit to serve lifetime terms suddenly became qualified  This dramatic and sudden shift shows that the arguments leveled against these judges were based less on principle and more on political expediency         The political stakes for the far left could not be higher  Liberal academia and interest groups are terrified that President Bush   s judicial nominees may limit their ability to enact policies through the courts that have failed at the ballot box  As a result  some will stop at nothing to vilify anyone who threatens their grip on power  The irrational accusations of extremism will likely become more intense in future debates         Sadly  many in the minority espouse judicial diversity as long as a judicial nominee expresses an opinion with which they agree  Anyone who fails their liberal litmus test will be condemned as being    outside of the mainstream    even if that accusation defies common sense  For example  Priscilla Owen was condemned for being out of the mainstream for defending a law requiring that parents be notified when their underage daughters seek abortion services when nearly 80 percent of Americans support parental notification laws         If some in the minority were as insightful as they claim to be about    mainstream America    they would not be in the minority  The fact is  many of these three nominees    fiercest critics neither understand nor agree with mainstream America on many issues  Mainstream Americans are sick and tired of judicial activism  which is why President Bush will continue to nominate diverse judges who will interpret the law  not invent new laws and precedents from the bench                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 488 546 581 460 00      31 090 21 Per Citizen
