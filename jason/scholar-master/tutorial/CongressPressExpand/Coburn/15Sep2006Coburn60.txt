                                                                 September 15  2006  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Richard Burr  R NC   Jeff Sessions  R AL   and Tom Coburn  MD  R OK  today called for more equitable distribution of Ryan White CARE Act funds  saying the funding disparities and the elevated rate of new HIV AIDS infections among Southern rural and minority populations must be addressed  Currently  Southern states  which now account for a majority of HIV AIDS cases in the nation  are being shortchanged in Ryan White CARE Act funding     The three senators raised the issue at a news conference sponsored by the National Minority Health Month Foundation and the Southern AIDS Coalition   Ryan White CARE Act funding provides medical care  anti retroviral treatments  counseling and testing  and other services for HIV AIDS patients     Ryan White CARE Act funding must be distributed more equally among states  North Carolinas waiting list for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program has been close to 1 000 in recent years  This is unacceptable  Burr said  The Ryan White CARE Act exists to protect and support those living with HIV and AIDS  In North Carolina  we have approximately 18 900 residents living with HIV and AIDS  It is time for Ryan White funds to be distributed more evenly so all patients  not just those living in New York  San Francisco and Boston  can receive the care they need     A recent Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation found that several funding schemes in the current Ryan White CARE Act program discriminate against rural and Southern states  States with large metropolitan areas benefit from double counting in which those with AIDS who live in cities are counted twiceonce under title I  large metropolitan area CARE Act funding  and again under title II  state CARE Act funding   Funds are currently being distributed based upon cases of AIDS  the end stage of HIV infection  rather than cases of HIV and AIDS  Those living with HIV in Southern states represent the emerging epidemic and therefore are not counted in CARE Act federal funding formulas  Finally  while shortchanged Southern states have been forced to implement waiting lists and other restrictions for AIDS drugs  GAO found that at least one metropolitan areaSan Franciscoreceives funding for dead people and is provided twice the amount of funding per AIDS cases as every other area     It is time for HIV and AIDS patients to receive equitable treatment regardless of where they live  Sessions said  Geography should not be a death sentence  and the South in particular has gotten the short end of the stick  Right now Alabamas patients receive far less assistance than those in big cities  even though Alabamas HIV rate is above the national HIV rate  Lives are on the line and I am committed to moving this legislation forward so that patients in Alabama and every state receive fair funding   Senator Coburn  a physician who has treated patients with HIV over the past two decades  stated Congress should put the lives of all those living with HIV ahead of petty parochial and political interests that have stalled the CARE Act reauthorization for the past year and pass the compromise bill before October 1  It is unacceptable that federal funding is being allocated for dead people in one area  while patients in other areas are literally dying on waiting lists for AIDS drugs  The CARE Act must be updated to ensure access to treatment for all Americans living with HIV  promote early diagnosis  and provide more equitable funding that reflects the face of HIV AIDS today  The discrimination that renders Americans living with HIV in rural and Southern states as having only a fraction of the worth of those living elsewhere must end     The South has been particularly hard hit in recent years  with seven of the nations 10 highest AIDS rates located in the region  Most of the growth is occurring in the African American population  especially among African American women  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 40 000 people in the United States become infected with HIV each year  and more than 1 million Americans currently have HIV AIDS  Over 500 000 Americans have died as a result of AIDS   The Ryan White CARE Act Reauthorization  S  2823  legislation was favorably voted out of the Senate HELP Committee in May with only a single dissenting vote  It is awaiting action by the full Senate
