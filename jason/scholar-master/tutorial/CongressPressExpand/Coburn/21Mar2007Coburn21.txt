          Press Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      March 21  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK   a practicing physician and member of the U S  Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP   today introduced the Universal Health Care Choice and Access Act  a comprehensive health care reform plan  U S  Senator Richard Burr  R NC   who also is a member of the HELP committee  joined Dr  Coburn as an original co sponsor     Americans are tired of out of control medical costs  gatekeepers blocking access to the doctors they want to see  being denied coverage of medically necessary care  and health plans that they dont understand  This bill addresses all of these problems and does so without creating new government programs or bureaucracies  In fact  this bill removes government and insurance bureaucrats from the doctors office by providing patients with federal tax rebates that will ensure that every American can purchase the health care coverage that best meets their medical needs  Americans who are capable of shopping for their own housing  transportation or clothing also are capable of shopping for their own health care  Dr  Coburn said     Senator Burr said  Our health care system needs serious improvements  This legislation makes health care coverage accessible and affordable for all Americans through private insurance coverage  while also promoting prevention and wellness which can improve lives and lower medical costs  I believe this legislation takes a big step toward fixing our health care system     Dr  Coburn added  Universal coverage is possible and Americans are right to demand it  We will move closest to this goal when we promote the same innovation and competition in health care that we see in every other American industry  From cars  to televisions  to computers  competition and innovation improve customer service  and help Americans access goods and services at lower prices     Government run  Big Brother health care plans that some politicians are vowing to revive would drive up tax rates  strangle our economy and deprive the most vulnerable individuals in society of basic health coverage  The seductive rhetoric behind Big Brother health care hides the fact that socialized systems stay afloat by rationing care and letting people die before their time    That approach to health care is unconscionable  Dr  Coburn said     The American people deserve an honest debate about specific ideas and solutions  not empty campaign rhetoric and slogans  What we are doing isnt working  Health care costs are rising three times faster than the rate of inflation with no corresponding rise in quality  One of out of every four health dollars spent in this country does nothing to help patients get well because it is wasted on defensive medicine  unnecessary paperwork or outright fraud  Meanwhile  Washington is facing the inconvenient truth that our health care system will be overwhelmed by the demographic tsunami of retiring baby boomers if Congress doesnt act quickly to fix this system  Doing nothing to reform our health care system will not only compromise the health of millions of Americans  it will cause tax rates to double  stagnate our economy and severely undermine our ability to compete in a global market  Dr  Coburn said     Key provisions of the Universal Health Care Choice and Access Act include    Promoting prevention  The legislation will reform our rudderless and wasteful federal prevention programs and demand results and accountability  Five preventable chronic diseases  heart disease  cancer  stroke  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and diabetes  cause two thirds of American deaths  Seventy five percent of total health expenditures are spent to treat these largely preventable chronic diseases  A sound prevention strategy will save countless lives and billions of dollars     MediChoice tax rebates that will shift tax breaks away from businesses to individuals  Giving Americans a rebate check   2 000 for individuals and  5 000 for families  to buy their own insurance will foster competition  improve quality and drive down prices  This provision will help put individuals back in charge of the health care  and help restore the doctor patient relationship that has been severed by third party government and health insurance bureaucrats     Creation of a national market for health insurance  The bill would give Americans the right to shop for health insurance anywhere in America  Patients should not be forced to be pay for outrageously expensive health plans in states like New Jersey when they can save thousands by buying plans from companies in other states     Creating transparency of health care costs and services  This Act requires hospitals and providers receiving reimbursements from Medicare to disclose their estimated and actual charges for all patients as well as the rates they are reimbursed through Medicare and Medicaid  This provision could allow patients to Google their doctor and comparison shop for health care the way that they do for cars  computers  or other products and services     Securing Medicares future by increasing choice and encouraging savings  The bill retains existing benefits but encourages true competition among private plans to hold down costs  a model which already is working in Medicares prescription drug benefit  The plan would give Medicare recipients similar health care options available to members of Congress and employees of Fortune 500 companies     Keeping Medicaid on mission  The bill liberates the poor from substandard government care and offers states the option to provide their Medicaid beneficiaries the kind of health care coverage that wealthier Americans enjoy  The bill creates incentives for states to achieve private universal coverage for their population  The bill offers states the freedom to design the programs that serve their beneficiaries with the best care instead of the current  one size fits all straitjacket        Other key provisions in the bill would provide more health care choices to veterans and American Indians  improve the accuracy of medical records  and limit frivolous lawsuit by solving disputes through mediation and impartial medical experts                                                                                                                                                                                                                               9 488 539 215 720 00      31 090 19 Per
