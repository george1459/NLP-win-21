WASHINGTON  D C    A comprehensive plan to provide  3 96 billion in federal tax relief to flood  tornado and severe storm victims in the Midwest was introduced today by Senators Chuck Grassley and Tom Harkin of Iowa  Kit Bond and Claire McCaskill of Missouri  Norm Coleman and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Dick Durbin and Barack Obama of Illinois  Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback of Kansas  and Evan Bayh and Richard Lugar of Indiana  The  Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008  is modeled after tax legislation that Congress passed to help victims of Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma in 2005 and the tornado in Kiowa County  Kansas in 2007   Sponsors of the new legislation    S 3322    are urging Congress to act quickly   The same bill was introduced today in the House of Representatives by Representatives Dave Loebsack  Tom Latham  Bruce Braley  Steve King and Leonard Boswell of Iowa   Federal tax relief has proven to be very helpful to disaster recovery efforts in recent years   This summer  devastating natural disasters hit Iowa and other parts of the Midwest  so now it s time for Congress to pass tax relief legislation for the Midwest   I was Chairman of the Finance Committee after Hurricane Katrina   Lawmakers acted quickly for victims along the Gulf Coast   In 2005  a major individual tax relief package was signed by the President within three weeks of the Katrina disaster   A few weeks later  Congress followed up with an infrastructure and business tax relief package   Congress appropriated  60 billion in emergency funds within a week of the storm and much more followed   This year  we re seeking the same consideration for Midwestern disaster victims   Grassley said    After learning lessons from 9 11  Katrina and other disaster packages  we ve tailored this year s package to the needs of this major natural disaster    Iowans are picking up the pieces after enduring one of the most brutal floods in our state s history   Harkin said   After a disaster of this magnitude  Iowans deserve strong federal support  This tax relief will go a long way toward helping families  businesses and non profits recover and rebuild after the disaster     The recent floods  severe storms  and tornadoes have torn through the homes and lives of many Minnesotans and they need our help   Coleman said    This tax relief legislation provides victims of the Midwestern disasters with the support needed to recover and rebuild their communities  The best time to deliver this relief was yesterday  but the second best time is now and I will stand with my colleagues to ensure it becomes a reality for those who are still recuperating from the disasters    In Illinois  we still don t know the full extent of our losses   Durbin said    The damage is bad  but it could have been a lot worse had it not been for the hard work and determination of everyone who helped us prepare for the floods   I will bring a similar resolve to Washington as we work on approval of a tax relief package that will help people and communities across the Midwest get back on their feet after this major disaster    Families and communities across Illinois and the Midwest have lost so much as a result of this summer s flooding  and we must do everything we can to help them recover and rebuild as soon as possible   Obama said    I am proud to support this bill to offer tax relief and assistance to the victims of this disaster   I will continue to work with my colleagues to help rebuild the Midwest in the days and weeks ahead    From tornados this spring to the recent flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers  Missourians have been hard hit by Mother Nature   The provisions in this bill will help disaster victims in my home state and across the Midwest rebuild   It is critical Congress acts now to provide the relief our families  businesses and communities need   Bond said   Throughout this epic event Missourians were able to come together and do what was necessary to prevent a tremendous amount of damage   And yet  the devastation is still overwhelming   Missourians will need all help from all possible angles to make sure we can rebuild America s heartland   McCaskill said   Our local communities in Minnesota showed incredible courage and resilience in rebuilding from this year s floods and storms    Klobuchar said   But at a time like this  local communities should not be expected to fend for themselves  The federal government has an essential role to support communities as they recover and rebuild    Disaster Tax Relief is a critical element of recovery as many Indiana communities embark on efforts to rebuild their homes and businesses   Lugar said   Thousands of residents in Indiana and across the Midwest have had their lives chaotically disrupted by storms  tornadoes and floods  We can and must do more to deliver critical aid to storm victims so they can rebuild their homes  their businesses and their lives   Bayh said  Individuals and businesses located in presidentially declared disaster areas due to floods  tornados and severe storms in Iowa  Arkansas  Illinois  Indiana  Kansas  Michigan  Minnesota  Missouri  Nebraska and Wisconsin would be eligible for the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008    Among other provisions  the legislation would let disaster victims with damage to their primary residence tap their assets and access cash by withdrawing money from retirement plans without tax penalties  suspend limits on tax incentives for charitable contributions  strengthening local and other fundraising drives collecting money to help small businesses and families recover  create tax credit bond authority to help local governments rebuild infrastructure  increase the amount of tax exempt bond authority to help businesses receive below market interest rate financing  remove limitations on deducting casualty losses due to natural disaster  and reduce the 2008 tax burden for small and mid sized businesses by substantially increasing the 2008 deductions for the depreciation and expensing of business property  Here s a summary of what s in the bill  RELIEF FOR ALL COUNTIES DECLARED ELIGIBLE FOR

warrant individual assistance  individual and public assistance  or public only assistance due to flooding  tornadoes  or severe storms   Qualified Disaster Recovery Assistance Distributions   The proposal waives the 10 percent penalty tax if a distribution from an individual retirement account   IRA   or tax favored retirement plan  e g   Code sections 401 k   403 b   or 457 b  plans  is considered a qualified Disaster Recovery Assistance distribution   qualified distribution     A distribution is considered a qualified distribution if it is made on or after the presidentially declared disaster date   applicable declaration date   and before January 1  2010 and is made to an individual whose principal residence on the applicable declaration date is located in a Midwestern disaster area and who sustained an economic loss by reason of the disaster   Other principal features include the following   i  the waiver is limited to amounts up to  100 000   ii  the mandatory withholding rules applicable to eligible rollover distributions would not apply   iii  participants receiving a qualified distribution would be permitted to spread the income tax resulting from

would not be includible in income in the tax year in which the distribution was made  e g   if a participant received a qualified distribution in 2008 and subsequently re contributed the distribution amount in 2009  the participant may file an amended return requesting a refund for the amount taxable in 2008   Recontribution of Withdrawals for Home Purchases   The proposal allows distributions for home purchases that were made from a Code section 401 k  or 403 b  plan or IRA after the date which is 6 months before the applicable declaration date and before the day after the applicable declaration date and that were not finalized because of the tornadoes and floods giving rise to the designation of the area as a disaster area to be re contributed to the plan or IRA tax free  i e   the recontributions would be treated as rollovers    Amounts must be re contributed within four months from the date of enactment of the bill in order to receive favorable tax treatment  Loans from Qualified Plans   The proposal effectively doubles the limitation on loans from a 401 k   403 b   or a governmental 457 b  plan by allowing participants located in a Midwestern disaster area and who

taxpayers who itemize only to the extent they exceed ten percent of adjusted gross income and a one hundred dollar floor  In some circumstances  taxpayers are permitted to include a current year

additional personal exemption increase of  2 000    Family members  other than spouses and dependents  staying with the taxpayer may qualify  and the housing must be provided rent free  This proposal

respect to the same person  Exclusion for Certain Cancellations of Indebtedness   Under current law  gross income generally includes any amount realized from the discharge of indebtedness   The

the mortgage lender discharges all or part of this mortgage debt  the amount discharged is not treated as income as a result of the proposal  Extension of Replacement Period for Property Lost Due to Floods or Tornadoes in the Midwestern Disaster Zone   Present law allows taxpayers not to recognize gain with respect to homes that are damaged or destroyed as a result of a presidentially declared

graduate level  whether or not pursuing a degree   equal to 20  of the first  10 000 in qualified tuition and related expenses  The proposal doubles the Hope Credit dollar amounts so the maximum

property in service in certain circumstances for the Midwestern disaster area for up to one year  Expensing Property   Current law permits certain small businesses to deduct up to  250 000 of the cost

nonresidential real property and residential rental property   This proposal would also increase the level of investment at which benefits phase out from  350 000 to  1 4 million of qualifying
