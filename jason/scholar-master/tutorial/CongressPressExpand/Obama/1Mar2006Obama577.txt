                Obama Criticizes White House Plan to Cut Benefits to Nuclear Weapons Workers Friday  February 17  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 17  2006  Obama Criticizes White House Plan to Cut Benefits to Nuclear Weapons Workers   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to President Bush expressing his deep concern about press reports indicating that the White House is planning to cut benefits to men and women who developed cancer and other serious illnesses while helping the United States develop nuclear weapons during the cold war    The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  was enacted in 2000 to provide compensation and medical benefits to employees who worked at certain Department of Energy facilities and nuclear weapons plants  including contractors  subcontractors  and some vendors  Under the EEOICPA  workers who suffer from certain radiation induced cancers and diseases are eligible to receive  150 000 plus coverage of medical expenses    According to press accounts  the White House will be leading an interagency working group to develop ways  to contain growth in the costs of the benefits  of this compensation program  This interagency working group will also discuss whether  administration clearance  should be required before groups of workers are deemed eligible for compensation    In his letter to the President  Obama wrote   If these press reports are true  the White House s plan demonstrates a startling lack of compassion for workers who sacrificed their health to provide for our national security  The Administration should be doing more to help these workers  not trying to make it more difficult for them to receive the benefits that they deserve     Workers at 17 former Illinois nuclear weapons plants qualify under the EEOICPA   However  Obama said that statistics from three of these plants demonstrate the difficulty in obtaining compensation  General Steel Industries plant in Granite City   408 cases have been filed  1 has been paid   Dow Chemical plant in Madison   164 cases have been filed  2 have been paid  Blockson Chemical plant in Joliet   195 cases have been filed  8 have been paid    Nationwide  of the 51 188 cases filed by former nuclear plant workers  only 11 829   or 23     have been paid   However  this 23  figure is misleading because it does not account for the thousands of workers who do not know they qualify for the program or those workers who died before they could submit a claim    Below  please find the full text of the letter      February 17  2006    The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC  20500   Dear Mr  President    I am deeply disturbed by recent press reports that the White House is planning to cut benefits to brave and hardworking Americans who developed cancer from working on the nuclear weapons program during the Cold War     The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  was enacted in 2000 to provide compensation and medical benefits to employees who worked at certain Department of Energy facilities and nuclear weapons plants  including contractors  subcontractors  and some vendors   Under the EEOICPA  workers who suffer from certain radiation induced cancers and diseases are eligible to receive  150 000 plus coverage of medical expenses    According to press accounts  the White House will be leading an interagency working group to develop ways  to contain growth in the costs of the benefits  of this compensation program   This interagency working group will also discuss whether  administration clearance  should be required before groups of workers are deemed eligible for compensation     If these press reports are true  the White House s plan demonstrates a startling lack of compassion for workers who sacrificed their health to provide for our national security   The Administration should be doing more to help these workers  not trying to make it more difficult for them to receive the benefits that they deserve    Nationwide  of the 51 188 cases filed by former nuclear plant workers  only 11 829   or 23     have been paid   However  this 23  figure is misleading because it does not account for the thousands of workers who do not know they qualify for the program or those workers who died before they could submit a claim    In Illinois  I have heard from many of my constituents about the problems they have experienced in filing claims and the red tape they have confronted over the years   Workers at 17 former Illinois nuclear weapons plants qualify under the EEOICPA   However  statistics from three of these plants demonstrate the difficulty in obtaining compensation   General Steel Industries plant in Granite City   408 cases have been filed  1 has been paid   Dow Chemical plant in Madison   164 cases have been filed  2 have been paid  Blockson Chemical plant in Joliet   195 cases have been filed  8 have been paid    I urge you to implement changes to streamline and expedite the process for filing claims and receiving compensation   I also request that you release the White House document describing the new interagency working group   In addition  I will be calling for the relevant Senate committees to hold hearings on this important matter    Mr  President  now is not the time to cut benefits for these former nuclear plant workers or put more bureaucratic red tape in front of them   These workers made a commitment to our country when the country needed them   Now it s our turn to help them in their time of need    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
