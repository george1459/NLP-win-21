FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                       CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA   Semonti Mustaphi  HARKIN    Melissa Wagoner  KENNEDY   or Christina Mulka  DURBIN  128 Nursing Homes are Currently Under Review for Poor Performance  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt  calling on him to immediately release a list of 128 nursing homes that are being scrutinized for providing poor care   According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  identified these facilities because of their history of consistent violations of health and safety regulations  such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  serious neglect  and physical abuse   To date  the Department has identified only 54 of these facilities  refusing to disclose the names of the other 74 facilities  thereby potentially endangering the health and safety of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens   Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   Evan Bayh  D IN   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Ron Wyden  D OR  also signed the letter    In the letter  the nine senators also called on Leavitt to provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies as to whether they are permitted to release such information to the public   Last week  Obama sent a similar letter to Leavitt  vowing to pursue legislative action if this information is not released  Obama has not yet received a response to that letter  The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Leavitt  We are writing to express our serious objections to the withholding of critical information about nursing home conditions from America   s senior citizens  An estimated 1 5 million residents live in approximately 16 000 nursing homes in the United States   This year  federal  state  and local governments will spend  82 billion on nursing home care  of which  56 5 billion will come from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid   All nursing homes that receive federal funding are subject to federal regulation and annual inspections   Under federal law  these inspections are a matter of public record and are made available to nursing home residents and their family members  and summaries of the inspection reports are posted on your department   s Nursing Home Compare website  www medicare gov NHCompare   These federal inspection and public disclosure requirements ensure that nursing home residents are receiving the high quality of care that they deserve   Given the importance of protecting one of our nation   s most vulnerable populations  we were disturbed to learn that your department is withholding information about some of the worst performing nursing homes in the country    According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has compiled a list of 128    special focus facilities    that are among the worst performing nursing homes in the country   These facilities are ones that have consistently been cited for serious violations of health and safety regulations     violations such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  pressure sores  serious neglect  and physical abuse   If these violations are not corrected  the facility could be subject to penalties and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs    However  of the 128 worst performing facilities  only 54 of these nursing homes have been publicly identified   The remaining 74 facilities have not been disclosed to the public  even though this information would be invaluable not only to current residents of those facilities but also to potential residents and their family members   It is incomprehensible why the complete list of 128 facilities     which is determined on the basis of publicly available inspection reports     would not be made public  Although the names of the 128    special focus facilities    have not been made available to the public  press accounts suggest that the complete list has been provided to the American Health Care Association  the main lobbying organization for the nursing home industry   Providing information about poorly performing nursing homes to the lobbyists who represent those facilities  and not to the senior citizens who would most benefit from this information  is outrageous  There is also some uncertainty among state inspection agencies as to whether states have the right to release the names of the previously undisclosed    special focus facilities      Following recent press stories  the Iowa inspection agency released the names of the five Iowa facilities on the list  yet Texas officials have said they cannot release this information without permission from CMS    Accordingly  we call on you to immediately release the names of all 128    special focus facilities    or at the very least  provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies that they are permitted to release such information to the public   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  Tom Harkin  Edward Kennedy  Dick Durbin  Jeff Bingaman  Joseph Lieberman  Evan Bayh  Bernard Sanders  Ron Wyden                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
