   Obama  Webb Amendment Honors Troops    Sacrifice  Strengthens Military Readiness   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Webb Amendment Honors Troops    Sacrifice  Strengthens Military Readiness Wednesday  September 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  made the following statement on the floor of the Senate to urge his colleagues to support an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to require minimum periods between deployment for members of the Armed Forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  The legislation is sponsored by Senator Jim Webb  D VA   Obama is a cosponsor  Below are Senator Obama   s remarks as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator Webb to require minimum periods between deployments for members of our Armed Forces who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   This amendment protects our brave men and women in uniform and ensures that our Armed Forces retain their ability to meet any challenge around the world   I   m proud to be a cosponsor       I opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning and have called repeatedly for a responsible end to the foreign policy disaster that this Administration has created   Over 3 700 American servicemen and women have died in this war  and over 27 000 have been seriously wounded   Each month  this misguided war costs us a staggering  10 billion  and when all is said and done  it will have cost us  1 trillion        There are different views of the war in this chamber  but there is no disagreement about the tremendous sacrifice of the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have performed valiantly under exceedingly difficult circumstances   They have done everything that we have asked of them       But they have also been stretched to the limit   The truth is we are not keeping our sacred trust with our men and women in uniform     we are asking too much of them  and we are asking too much of their families   We owe it to our troops and their families to adopt a fair policy that ensures predictable rotations  adequate time to be with their families before redeployment  and adequate time for realistic training for the difficult assignments we are giving them        Our servicemen and women will always answer the call of duty  but the reality is that extended deployments and insufficient rest periods are taking their toll   The effects of this strain are clear   increasing attrition rates  falling retention rates among West Point graduates  increasing rates of PTSD  and unprecedented strain on military families      This amendment is a responsible way to keep our sacred trust while restoring our military to an appropriate state of readiness   It ensures that members of our Armed Forces who are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have at least the same amount of time at home before they are redeployed   It would also ensure that members of a reserve component  including the National Guard  cannot be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment         After four and a half years of fighting in Iraq and almost six years of fighting in Afghanistan  we owe it to our troops and their families to provide them with a more predictable schedule with sufficient time at home between deployments   As the Military Officers Association of America  which represents 368 000 members  has stated      If we are not better stewards of our troops and their families in the future than we have been in the recent past  MOAA believes strongly that we will be putting the all volunteer force at unacceptable risk          There are scores of anecdotes that bear out the strain on our families   One woman from Illinois recently wrote my office to tell me how her husband was facing his fourth deployment in four and a half years   She described how her husband had spent so much time in Iraq that  in her words      He feels like he is stationed in Iraq and only deploys home      That is not an acceptable way to treat our troops   That is not an acceptable way to treat their families        This amendment is not only important for military families  it   s also important for our national security        Our military simply cannot sustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to respond to contingencies around the world        This is all the more important since the Administration has squandered our resources on the war in Iraq and neglected to address other serious threats to our safety   According to a National Intelligence Estimate in July  al Qaeda has    protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability     including a safe haven in Pakistan   s tribal areas  operational lieutenants  and its top leadership   Ensuring the readiness and capabilities of our troops will be crucial to confronting the threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and other parts of the world  and deterring other threats to America   s national security        Over the coming months  I will continue to push for a new course in Iraq that immediately begins a safe and orderly withdrawal of our combat troops  that changes our military mission to focus on training and counter terrorism  that puts real pressure on the Iraqis to resolve their grievances  and that focuses our military efforts on the real threats facing our country   This amendment is an important part of that new course        I urge my colleagues to support this proposal
