   Obama Statement on Iraq Redeployment Plans   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Iraq Redeployment Plans Tuesday  May 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt       Today  1518 days after it began  the war in Iraq rages on  with no sign of a resolution          The Iraqi people appear no closer to the settling their differences  The Iraqi government is more divided and dysfunctional than ever   The Iraqi parliament speaks of adjourning for the summer  without addressing the major issues standing in the way of a ceasefire   And our brave young servicemen and women are still fighting and dying to police someone else s civil war          I opposed this war from the start for all the reasons that are now clear          In January  I introduced a plan that already would have begun redeploying our troops out of Iraq  with the goal of removing all of our combat troops by March 31   But it also would offer enough flexibility to delay our exit in the event that the Iraqis responded with meaningful steps toward peace   I still believe in that approach  which the President vetoed earlier this month   Ultimately  I think it will become the framework for a bipartisan coalition the President can t resist          Today  I have reintroduced that plan          Tomorrow  I expect cloture votes on two other proposals    One is the Reid Feingold plan  which would begin a withdrawal of troops in 120 days and end all combat operations on April 1   The other is Senator Levin s proposal  which would create standards and benchmarks for additional funding          I will support both  not because I believe either is the best answer  but because I want to send a strong statement to the Iraqi government  the President and my Republican colleagues that it s long past time to change course          Meanwhile  I ll continue to press for my own plan  and work to find the 16 votes in the Senate to pass it with a veto proof majority and bring our troops home quickly  safely and responsibly
