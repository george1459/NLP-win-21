   Obama Calls on House to Pass Ethics Reform Legislation that Includes Bundling Disclosure   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on House to Pass Ethics Reform Legislation that Includes Bundling Disclosure Thursday  May 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  DC       Today  we moved one step closer toward sweeping ethics reform in Washington   The House Judiciary Committee approved a provision that would require lobbyists to disclose how much they have bundled and who they bundle it from   We should not keep the biggest role lobbyists play hidden   We need to bring the practice out into the open        That is why I proposed and the Senate passed legislation last year that would require quarterly reporting of all contributions that a lobbyist collected or arranged that total more than  200 in a calendar year   This includes not only campaign contributions  but also contributions to presidential libraries  inaugural committees  and lawmakers    charities   The law doesn   t call for a complete halt in bundling   It just calls on lobbyists who have a stake in the outcome of legislation to disclose that information to the public        In 2006  we made a promise to the American people to change Washington   The House has the opportunity to honor that promise   If we can open up the system and pull aside the curtain of secrecy  then we just might be able to start changing the way Washington works
