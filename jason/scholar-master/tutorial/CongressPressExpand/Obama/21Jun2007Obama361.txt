   Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  Obama Urge Immediate Review of Discharge Process for U S  Military Personnel   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  Obama Urge Immediate Review of Discharge Process for U S  Military Personnel Thursday  June 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact   Bond  Shana Marchio   Boxer  Natalie Ravitz  Lieberman  Rob Sawicki  Obama  Ben LaBolt    WASHINGTON  D C      A bipartisan group of U S  Senators led by Senators Kit Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   and Barack Obama  D IL   today asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to launch a full review of the personality disorder discharge process across the Armed Forces     The Senators  who have been examining the mental health care treatment of service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  recently became alarmed over reports about the inappropriate use of personality disorder discharges     The use of a personality discharge can result in a loss of disability benefits and medical care from the VA  and can even lead to service members having to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses    Bond  Boxer  Lieberman and Obama expressed concern with a process that is diagnosing thousands of service members with long and honorable military careers with    pre existing    personality disorders that have only emerged after combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan       Recent reports about the abuse of personality disorder discharges are inexcusable   It is critical we act now and work to restore the confidence of our service members     said Senator Kit Bond      The men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our nation     and our freedoms     deserve the highest quality care      Sen  Boxer said     It appears as if the military is using    personality disorder discharges    to avoid covering the healthcare needs of our service members  many of whom are suffering from PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury as a result of their service in Iraq and Afghanistan   This is immoral and has to stop          We have an obligation to ensure that our service members are accurately diagnosed and treated for their psychological wounds     Senator Lieberman said      We cannot afford to do anything less  I urge the Department of Defense to review its policies to ensure that service members are not being inappropriately discharged          Reports that the Department of Defense is abusing its personality discharge procedures are especially troubling given the thousands of American service members we know to be suffering from less visible  service related psychological injuries     said Senator Obama      The Department of Defense must conduct a comprehensive review of its personality disorder discharge procedures and its mental health care system  to ensure that service members who have risked everything and now suffer from a mental health condition receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve      Bond  Boxer  Lieberman and Obama were joined by 26 of their Senate colleagues including   Max Baucus  D MT   Evan Bayh  D IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Maria Cantwell  D WA   Benjamin Cardin  D MD   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Susan Collins  R ME   Christopher Dodd  D CT   Elizabeth

sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asking him to conduct an independent review of the discharge process  to implement appropriate measures to prevent abuse of the process  and to support the creation of a Special Discharge Review Board to assist in reviewing petitions from military personnel who have already been discharged for personality disorders and who have honorable service records in Iraq and Afghanistan   The Honorable Dr  Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C   20301 Dear Secretary Gates  We urge you to conduct a thorough and independent review of the personality disorder discharge process across the Armed Forces  We are concerned over continuing reports from Veterans    Service Organizations  the media  and individual U S  service personnel that personality disorder discharges have been implemented inappropriately and inconsistently  There are indications that personality disorder discharges are being used as a tool to discharge expeditiously U S  service personnel who have service connected injuries  such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  or Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   Even more troubling is the perception that the U S  military is using these discharges to avoid disability and medical benefits payments   The Washington Post deftly illustrated an example of this problem on June 17  2007  in a piece entitled    The War Inside     According to the Post   after serving a combat tour in Iraq   Army Specialist Jeans Cruz returned to Ft  Hood  Texas  crippled by the mental anguish of his combat experience  Notes from his medical files indicate    major depression     and    anger from Iraq  nightmares  flashbacks     The Army was so concerned that it even went so far as to have Spc  Cruz sign a    Life Maintenance Agreement     a document stating that he agreed    not to harm himself or anyone else     But the Army ultimately discharged Spc  Cruz with a    personality disorder     in essence finding that Spc  Cruz   s medical problems had nothing to do with his service in Iraq   Since personality disorder discharges are considered    pre existing     personnel discharged under these provisions cannot collect disability benefits and may not receive medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs for these    pre existing    illnesses  Spc  Cruz experienced this first hand  On August 16  2006  Spc  Cruz received a letter from the VA stating that he had been denied disability pay   To make matters worse  military personnel given a personality disorder discharge who have not fulfilled their service contracts can find themselves forced to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses back to the federal government  This can result in debilitating debt for military personnel and their families   many of whom supported our forces over many years of service and endured significant strain as a result of frequent and protracted combat deployments   Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed within the past six years  While this represents a small percentage of overall discharges  their inappropriate use and debilitating impact on personnel once discharged is cause for grave concern   Another egregious example of misuse was chronicled by reporter Joshua Kors on March 29  2007  in a piece entitled     How Specialist Town Lost his Benefits     A copy of the article is attached for your review   On October 19  2004  Spc  Jon Town was injured and sustained major loss of hearing in a rocket attack in Ramadi  Iraq  His injuries ultimately resulted in memory loss and depression  ending his military career  But instead of sending Spc  Town through the medical board process   an in depth medical review of a service member   s fitness that often results in the award of disability payments and allows injured personnel and their families to remain eligible for medical benefits after active service ends   the command at Ft  Carson  Colorado  elected to give Spc  Town a personality disorder discharge  This action deprived Spc  Town of disability benefits and guaranteed VA care for his injuries once he was discharged from the Army   While the Army claims to have thoroughly evaluated and reviewed the Town case  we understand that neither Spc  Town nor his fellow soldiers  who were aware of the rocket attack and his resulting injuries  were contacted to discuss the case  Hence in this situation  and we fear potentially in others  the Army review was inadequate and anything but thorough  Consequently  serious questions remain unanswered about the use  or abuse  of the personality disorder discharge and a chain of command that allows the inappropriate use of the discharge to continue even as members of Congress from both parties seek to review the practice and the media points out the glaring inconsistencies in the manner in which the personality discharge is administered   Like many veterans    advocates  we are skeptical about an administrative process that suddenly diagnoses military personnel who have long and honorable military careers  such as Spc  Cruz and Spc  Town  with pre existing personality disorders that reportedly become apparent only after combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan  We are particularly concerned that combat forces at the unit level and above are inadequately equipped to diagnose  treat  and work with personnel assessed with brain related injuries  and that the mechanisms tasked with handling the discharge process and meeting unit manning requirements are also overwhelmed   Therefore  we urge you to conduct a thorough and independent review of the personality discharge process and to implement appropriate measures to prevent the repeat of cases like Spc  Cruz   s and Spc  Town   s in the future  We also urge you to support the creation of a Special Discharge Review Board to assist the Board for Correction of Military Records for each service in reviewing petitions from personnel discharged for personality disorders with honorable service records in Iraq and Afghanistan   As the Walter Reed Army Medical Center hearings demonstrated  the American people will not tolerate substandard treatment and rehabilitative care for those who have served  As members of the United States Senate  we have an obligation to ensure that our service personnel and their families receive the benefits and care they are entitled to  We are eager to work with the Department of Defense on the issues we have outlined and look forward to hearing from you  Should your staff have additional questions  please direct them to James Pitchford of Sen  Bond   s staff or Ann Norris of Sen  Boxer   s staff
