   Durbin  Obama Call on State Department to Publicly Ask France to Follow American Example of Cooperation on Noreiga   s  Extradition and Extradite Hans Peterson Immediately   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Durbin  Obama Call on State Department to Publicly Ask France to Follow American Example of Cooperation on Noreiga   s  Extradition and Extradite Hans Peterson Immediately Tuesday  September 11  2007  For Immediate Release Contact   Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging her to consider  in light of the State Department   s support for France   s extradition request for Manuel Noriega  to publicly request that the Government of France extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago     In today   s letter  the Senators note that     The State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States  We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet          Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and reportedly confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson   s extradition     On August 23  France announced its decision not to extradite Peterson  While the extradition treaty between the United States and France says that there is    no obligation upon the requested state to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the requested state     this treaty does not preclude France from exercising its discretion to extradite one of its nationals to the U S       Last week  Durbin met with the newly appointed French Ambassador  Pierre Vimont  and the French Charg   d   Affaires  Fran  ois Rivasseau  to urge France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson   On August 27  Durbin and Senator Obama sent a letter to the French Foreign Minister  Bernard Kouchner  urging France to reconsider its decision    On August 20  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States    request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter on August 20 to Secretary of State Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case    text of the letter is below    September 11  2007 Dr  Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State  2201 C Street NW  Washington  DC 20520 Madam Secretary   We write to seek your urgent assistance with regard to the pending extradition request in the case of murdered Illinois doctor David Cornbleet   This letter follows up on our letter to you of August 20  to which we have not yet received a response   In light of the time  sensitive nature of this matter  we request that you respond to this letter as soon as possible and no later than one week from today      Dr  Cornbleet  a respected and beloved doctor from Chicago  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   In August 2007  Hans Peterson  an American citizen with dual French nationality  turned himself in to French authorities in the French West Indies and confessed to Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder  and we have contacted you and the French government to express our strong support for that request    However  the French government has said that France will not extradite Peterson  and that Peterson will be tried under the French justice system    We note that the State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States   We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet    We believe the specific facts of this case justify Peterson   s extradition to the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s murder was unspeakable in its brutality  and Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Dr  Cornbleet   s confessed murderer face trial in the United States   Hans Peterson was born in Oregon in 1978  and for the first 28 years of his life he lived in the United States and availed himself of the rights and privileges of U S  citizenship   Only after allegedly committing a heinous crime did Peterson flee the United States for French territory and seek the rights and privileges of French nationality in an attempt to escape criminal prosecution in the United States   There is legitimate concern that Peterson  if found guilty of murder in France  would serve a lesser sentence than he might be expected to serve if tried and convicted in the United States       The French ambassador has verbally indicated to us that Peterson cannot be extradited because French law prohibits the extradition of its nationals   However  Article 3 of the recent Extradition Treaty between the United States and France does not preclude France from extraditing one of its nationals to the United States   Moreover  the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France states that it was concluded in order    to provide for more effective cooperation between the two States in the suppression of crime and to facilitate relations between the two States in the area of extradition         That cooperation appears imminent in the case of Manuel Noriega  and would also be appropriate in the case of Hans Peterson   We have asked the Government of France to provide us with a written analysis reconciling its legal position with the plain language of the Extradition Treaty   To date  we have not received that written analysis    To the extent the Government of France has any discretion available under French law and international treaties to extradite Hans Peterson to the United States  we ask that the Government of the United States  through the State Department  urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition    We thank you in advance for the consideration of this request  and we again request that you reply to this letter as soon as possible  and in no case later than September 18     Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin                                                            United States Senator                                                     Barack Obama  United States Senator
