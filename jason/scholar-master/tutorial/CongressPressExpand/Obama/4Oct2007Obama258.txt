   Legislation Introduced to Ban Lead in Toys for Young Children   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Legislation Introduced to Ban Lead in Toys for Young Children Wednesday  October  3  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Karen Lightfoot  Waxman   Sharon Jenkins  Toure Muhammad  Rush   Rebecca Gale  Carney   Rick Jauert  Ellison   or Amy Brundage  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C      Citing recent recalls and the longtime failure of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect children from hazardous levels of lead in consumer products  Rep  Henry A  Waxman  together with Reps  Bobby L  Rush  Christopher P  Carney  and Keith Ellison  today introduced the Lead Free Toys Act to ban lead from toys  toy jewelry  and other products used by children under age six   Sen  Barack Obama introduced the companion bill in the Senate today      Lead in children   s products is dangerous and unnecessary     said Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee      For nearly three years I have called for strong action to get the lead out of these products   I hope now the time has arrived   This is the kind of simple  commonsense action that the Consumer Product Safety Commission should have taken years ago           The provisions called for in this bill are long overdue given more than 30 years of documented evidence of the damage that can be done to children  especially those in low income communities  from exposure to this neuro toxin     said Rep  Bobby Rush  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce  Trade  and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy and Commerce      Following recent hearings on this issue in our subcommittee  I believe that a full ban on lead in children   s toys and jewelry is the only way to prevent this poison from harming children and families         As a father of five  I am concerned about our children   s safety  Children   s toys on U S  store shelves should not contain unknown hazards that can cause such potentially devastating harm     said Rep  Christopher P  Carney      This legislation is a good first step to keeping hazardous substances out of our children   s toys   I look forward to working with Congressman Waxman to ensure the safety of toys across the nation   As the holidays approach  this legislation is even more urgent        I am honored to stand with Congressman Waxman in introducing this important legislation to ban lead in children   s toy products     said Rep  Keith Ellison      This is personal for me   Last year  one of my constituents  a four year old toddler named Jarnell Brown died because he swallowed a charm on a bracelet that contained dangerous amounts of lead   Were this legislation the law of the land  perhaps Jarnell would be celebrating a fifth birthday this year   This bill  when enacted  will prevent future tragedies for Jarnell Brown  his parents and countless other American families        Lead contaminated toys have endangered the lives of millions of our country   s children     said Sen  Obama      The health of our children is a top priority  and we must take every step required to protect them from these dangerous products   The extraordinary scale of this challenge demands meaningful and innovative solutions to prevent lead contaminated toys from harming our children   This legislation will help restore the confidence of the American people that the products they are using are thoroughly inspected and safe  and I thank Chairman Waxman for his leadership on this issue       High doses of lead can cause seizures and even death  while low doses can cause impaired learning and behavioral problems   Recent recalls of popular children   s toys have brought attention to the problem of lead in such products  but this issue is not new   In late 2004  nearly 150 million pieces of toy jewelry were recalled for toxic levels of lead   In 2005 and 2006 millions more pieces of tainted jewelry were recalled  and in March 2006  a young child died after ingesting a Reebok charm that contained over 99  lead  In January 2005  citing the initial wave of toy jewelry recalls  Rep  Waxman called on the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  to take decisive action to protect children   When CPSC refused to set a strong  enforceable standard  Reps  Waxman  Rush  and others introduced the Lead Free Toys Act  a bill directing CPSC to ban anything above trace levels of lead in children   s products   Now  over two years later  new recalls have exposed the presence of lead in many more children   s products  and CPSC still has failed to address this hazard   Today   s legislation imposes a statutory limit on lead in children   s products  rather than directing CPSC to impose such a ban  Under the bill as reintroduced  any product marketed for use by children under age six or whose substantial use by children under age six is foreseeable may contain no more than the following levels of lead  600 parts per million  ppm   effective within 30 days of enactment 250 ppm  effective one year after enactment 100 ppm  effective two years after enactment This step wise approach will impose immediate changes to protect children while giving manufacturers additional time to develop controls to ensure that all children   s products are free of lead  The text of the bill is available online at www oversight house gov
