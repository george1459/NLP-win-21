Suspicious Katrina Contracts Highlight Need for CFO Oversight   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today issued the following statement in the wake of reports of waste  mismanagement and fraud in the handling Hurricane Katrina rebuilding effort    Just a few weeks into the most expensive rebuilding effort of all time  we re already hearing reports of overcharges  underperformance  and mismanagement   said Obama and Coburn    Finding out after the fact that we re spending taxpayer money on no bid contracts and sweetheart deals for cruise lines is no way to run a recovery effort   We re already seeing examples that highlight the need for an independent CFO who will be in charge of every penny that goes out the door  The American public and the people of the Gulf Coast deserve no less       The Senate Federal Financial Management Subcommittee s investigation into a six month  192 million FEMA contract with Carnival Cruise Lines has discovered that taxpayers are paying  per evacuee  four times the amount a vacation cruise passenger would have to pay   Three Carnival ships are only half full and mostly occupied by relief workers   Carnival s overhead costs in the FEMA operation are far lower than during normal cruises   The Carnival ships are docked   No fuel is being used and no entertainment is being provided to the relief workers   Yet  taxpayers are paying  2 550 per guest per week  which is four times the cost of a  599 per person  7 Day Western Caribbean  Cruise from Galveston  TX   When the federal government would actually save millions of dollars by forgoing the status quo and actually sending evacuees on a luxurious six month cruise it is time to rethink how we are conducting oversight   A short term temporary solution has turned into a long term  grossly overpriced sweetheart deal for a cruise line   Obama and Coburn said    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    Richard Skinner  the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security said that FEMA officials awarding contracts  took a lot of shortcuts that may have resulted in a lot of waste    said Obama and Coburn   We should appoint a CFO immediately to ensure that rebuilding and reconstruction money gets to the people who need it the most   SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina   Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse   The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President   The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies and the president   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers
