   Obama Statement on the Situation in Burma   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Statement on the Situation in Burma Monday  October  1  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 For the last several days the world has watched the images of monks as they courageously and peacefully demand democracy in Burma     and the military junta s violent response   A regime that claims to be impervious to international criticism has moved to close off media and communications access to stem the flow of those images out of the country    The generals apparently believe that  without pictures  the world will eventually lose interest and move on   We must not allow this to happen  I am pleased that the United Nations has dispatched Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Burma and that he has met with Aung San Suu Kyi   I hope he will persuade the junta to open a dialogue with the opposition  to release political prisoners  and to account for those who were killed or imprisoned in the last few days   Meanwhile  President Bush is right to try to increase pressure on Burma s repressive regime   I urge all nations  including the EU and Burma s neighbors  to cooperate in enforcing the financial sanctions the United States has imposed   The United States should also push for a UN Security Council Resolution to ban the provision of arms to Burma  and press China to help persuade the regime to begin a serious dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and those seeking democratic reform  We also should lead in charting a unified course with ASEAN  China  India  Japan  and the EU to forge a road map for change in Burma  and prevent the junta from playing countries off each other as they have in the past  It is easy in this age to be cynical about the power of people to bring about change   But ordinary people armed with courage and hope are not powerless  they are history s mightiest force  even before the guns of a brutal regime    We must remain true to their cause and honor their bravery
