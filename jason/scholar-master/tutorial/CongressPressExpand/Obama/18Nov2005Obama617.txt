   Avian Flu Press Conference   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Avian Flu Press Conference Tuesday  November  1  2005  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama  Washington  DC   It has now been more than one year since the government first released its draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan    In that year  we have witnessed the relentless spread of avian flu from Southeast Asia to Western China  from Russia to the European continent     Just yesterday  we learned that it may have come even closer to home     Ducks in seven Canadian provinces have now tested positive for avian flu   If further tests do indeed show that they are carrying the H5N1 strain  it is only a matter of weeks before a migrating bird brings this deadly disease to our front door     121 people have already contracted the avian flu from infected birds   Sixty two have lost their lives   And if the virus ever mutates so that it can be passed from human to human  we will face global pandemic influenza that may kill millions    Forty countries now have pandemic preparedness plans  but until today  the United States was not one of them     Countries like Japan  France  England  and others have now stockpiled enough Tamiflu to cover a quarter of their populations   With enough to cover just two percent of our population  the United States is again not one of these countries     We find this unacceptable  and so we are encouraged by the President s decision today to join the efforts we ve been pursuing in Congress to combat the avian flu for nearly a year   But we must do more to prevent this pandemic   Much more         Mr  President  the United States cannot afford to have a Katrina level of preparedness or a Katrina like response to an international outbreak of Avian flu   With so many warnings and so much knowledge of the threat we face  there is no excuse for failure this time around     The President said today that this pandemic would require  the immediate attention of the United States Congress so we can have the resources in place to begin implementing this strategy right away     The good news is that many of us in Congress did not wait for the President to schedule a speech   Instead  we have already acted to ensure that our country is not left behind    In March  I requested  25 million in funding for greater global partnership  with the creation of an international council and more surveillance   This is money being used to prevent the flu right now      The President said he was going to send the Congress a funding request for  7 1 billion dollars for avian flu preparedness at home   But fortunately  the resources are already there     In September  we successfully secured  3 9 billion in funding  and just last week I worked with Senator Harkin and others to increase that number to  7 9 billion    In the AVIAN Act of 2005  which I introduced in April  I laid out a number of steps that were echoed by the President today   However  the legislation went a few steps further   Obviously we haven t seen the written plan just yet  but I do want to point out a few additional areas that should be part of this Administration s plan     First  the plan does not lay out a clear chain of command in the event of a crisis   It is unclear whether the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Health and Human Services will lead the response effort  but we have all seen during Katrina how important a clear chain of command is  and so the President should clarify this     Second  the plan s outreach and avian flu educational efforts seem limited to those with the ability to visit the government s website   The Senate included  75 million for an aggressive outreach campaign to the American public  and the President should do the same    Third  the President s proposed investment in the stockpiling of antivirals may fall short of what is ultimately needed   In the Senate we allocated an additional  2 billion to cover half of the American population   More will be needed if we are to prevent a pandemic    The President s proposal allocates money differently   he uses more money for the development of cell based vaccines   While this is good  again  more funding is needed to ensure we have the antiviral medicine our country needs    Fourth  it is unclear how much assistance the federal government is willing to provide already cash strapped states to strengthen their fragile health infrastructures   The Senate appropriations bill provides  600 million to bolster the public health infrastructure   We should keep this figure    Finally  the President s plan does not request funding for contingency planning and surge capacity for hospitals   The Senate provides  750 million to help doctors and hospitals expand their services and care for more patients in case of pandemic     The devastation wrought by the hurricanes of the last few months has shown us that we cannot stop the forces of nature   But as the wealthiest country on Earth  we can prepare  and we can respond in a way that saves as many lives as possible     We must do that now with the Avian Flu     We are encouraged that the Administration has finally released its preparedness plan  and we look forward to working with them on implementing the strongest version possible as soon as possible
