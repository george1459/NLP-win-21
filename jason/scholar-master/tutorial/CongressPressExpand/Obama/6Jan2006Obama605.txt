   Obama Questions Justice Department Ruling to Pre Approve Restrictive Georgia Voter ID Law   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Questions Justice Department Ruling to Pre Approve Restrictive Georgia Voter ID Law Wednesday  November 30  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  November 30  2005   Obama Questions Justice Department Ruling to Pre Approve Restrictive Georgia Voter ID Law   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Christopher J  Dodd  D CT  today sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales questioning the Department of Justice s  DOJ  pre approval of a Georgia law requiring residents to show a photo ID before voting despite the objections of four out of five career DOJ officials  The law was later ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in Georgia and the Eleventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals upheld the ruling    It is troubling that despite the objections of four out of five its own career employees  the Department of Justice would pre approve a law that would make it more difficult for minority  disabled  elderly and low income Americans to vote   said Obama   The law has since been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge and that ruling was upheld by the 11th Circuit  making it clear that the Department of Justice should have listened to its own staff     The Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires Georgia to submit any voting rule changes for review to the Justice Department to determine if they would adversely affect minority groups  The Justice department can then immediately stop the proposed changes or it can issue a  pre clearance  letter  which would allow it to proceed    According to an August 25  2005 DOJ memorandum released to the Washington Post  four of the five career staffers charged with analyzing the Georgia law recommended that DOJ oppose pre clearance of the program   These attorneys argued that the State of Georgia failed to prove  as required under the Voting Rights Act  that the measure would not unduly hinder the ability of minority voters to cast their ballots      I agree that there are real problems in our election systems that demand real answers   said Obama   But there is no evidence to suggest that there is a rash of voters appearing at the polls claiming to be someone they are not  In our democracy  the goal should be to encourage eligible voters to vote  not create new barriers to make it more difficult for some of our most vulnerable citizens to exercise their most basic right      At least 150 000 senior citizens in Georgia do not have government issued photo identification  Currently  Georgia has only 56 locations in its 159 counties where people can get this photo identification   and Atlanta  one of America s largest cities  is not one of them  The ID s would cost up to  35  which the court ruled would constitute a poll tax     In September  Senator Obama introduced a joint resolution with Georgia Congressman John Lewis  D GA  and Senator Chris Dodd  D CT  expressing their belief that any law requiring a photo ID to vote would put an undue burden on voters  The resolution was in response to the Department of Justice s clearance of the Georgia statute and the Carter Baker Commission on Election Reform s recommendation of a national ID requirement       November 30  2005   The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  United States Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20530 0001   Dear Attorney General Gonzales    We are writing to express our serious concerns about the decision of the Department of Justice  DOJ  to  pre clear  the recently enacted Georgia voting law pursuant to the requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965     As you know  despite DOJ s pre clearance of the law  a federal district judge temporarily stayed the Georgia law on the grounds that it would disproportionately affect minority voters and likely violate the Voting Rights Act and the U S  Constitution   The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has upheld that decision      The Department has attempted to characterize its pre clearance decision as a joint conclusion by both career and political officials   According to an August 25  2005  memorandum released by the Washington Post  however  four of the five career staffers charged with analyzing the Georgia law recommended that DOJ oppose pre clearance of the program   These attorneys argued that the State of Georgia failed to prove  as required under the Voting Rights Act  that the measure would not unduly hinder the ability of minority voters to cast their ballots      Despite the well reasoned recommendation of these career employees  the DOJ disregarded the employees  recommendation and pre cleared the law the next day      The same Washington Post story indicates that some former and current DOJ employees have claimed that political appointees also overruled career lawyers in approving redistricting measures in Texas and Mississippi   We understand that DOJ spokesperson  Eric Holland has dismissed claims that the August 25th memo is of any significance  claiming   The early draft       does not represent the quality of factual and legal analysis that the Justice Department expects in a final product    Nonetheless  we are concerned that the Georgia pre clearance decision is just the latest example of a trend within DOJ in which political appointees have ignored the decisions and recommendations of career attorneys in voting rights cases      In order for Congress to conduct oversight of DOJ s enforcement powers with respect to voting rights and election law  we request that you provide us with all DOJ documents regarding  discussing or otherwise relevant to the pre clearance of the Georgia law  including any documents discussing the decision to disregard the August 25th memorandum   We look forward to your response within the next two weeks    Sincerely
