   Obama  Senators Urge Special Review Board for Discharged Military Personnel  Moratorium on Personality Disorder Discharges   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama  Senators Urge Special Review Board for Discharged Military Personnel  Moratorium on Personality Disorder Discharges Friday  December 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama  Nathan Britton Boxer   or Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   Bond  Boxer  Obama  McCaskill Demand Fair Treatment of Combat Vets WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Kit Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Claire McCaskill  D MO  are urging President Bush to create a Special Review Board for discharged troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and to place a moratorium on the military   s use of Personality Disorder Discharges     With thousands of American service members suffering every day from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing     said Senator Obama      These heroes make incredible sacrifices for our country  and our brave men and women shouldn t have to fight a second war at home to get the benefits and care they deserve  The President should halt this practice until the military can review its policies and establish a special review board to examine the cases in question        Our government has a lifelong responsibility to care for the brave volunteers who have served our nation honorably in combat  unfortunately  the government is failing some of our wounded warriors     said Bond      It is critical that the government starts treating all of our troops    battle wounds     physical and mental  visible and invisible        It belittles the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform when you punish   instead of treat   those with combat injuries     said Boxer     When our brave service members are injured in combat  we cannot deny them benefits  blame their conditions on a pre existing disorder  or refuse them the care and support they deserve        The horrors of war are bad enough without a service member coming home only to have to fight against the government they fought to protect     McCaskill said     I   m please to be fighting side by side with Senator Bond in requesting a review board to study personality disorder discharges  so that those men and women who bravely fought for us and returned home with the mental scars from war get a fighting chance to receive the benefits they so greatly deserve     This bipartisan group of Senators has been examining mental health care for service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and leading the effort to end the military   s inappropriate use of personality disorder discharges  Much like the program created by President Carter to examine the records of Vietnam veterans discharged less than honorably  the Senators are urging the President to create a Special Discharge Review Program to look at administrative discharges for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  If established  the Board would give service members who served honorably in combat but subsequently received a discharge that does not entitle them to benefits the opportunity to have their cases reviewed   This is particularly important for those who failed to receive an appropriate diagnosis of or treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  or Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   The Senators believe such a process will help reduce the stigma associated with such discharges and allow those who served our nation honorably to resume normal lives after their service      The discharge review board will also look at cases where service members were diagnosed for personality disorders  In the past six years  more than 22 500 service men and women have been discharged with a    pre existing    personality disorder   The Senators have expressed concern that some of these discharges appear to be the result of misdiagnoses and are being used to force out troops who may instead be suffering from service connected psychological injuries     like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury  The use of a personality discharge can result in a loss of disability benefits and medical care from the VA  and can even lead to service members having to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses  The Senators continue to urge for the adoption of short term  commonsense safeguards to protect service members  The Senators emphasize that just limiting the use of this discharge is not enough  A moratorium  which would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat  is necessary until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and additional safeguard to prevent misdiagnosis                    Bond  Boxer  Obama and McCaskill were joined by a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues including  Joseph Biden  D
