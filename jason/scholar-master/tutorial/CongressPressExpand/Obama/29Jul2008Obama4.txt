   Obama Calls on Bush Administration to Examine DHL UPS Agreement for Services   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Obama Calls on Bush Administration to Examine DHL UPS Agreement for Services Tuesday  July 29  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 More than 8 000 jobs could be eliminated due to the agreement WASHINGTON  D C        U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Karl Zinsmeister  Director of the White House s Domestic Policy Council  asking the Administration to carefully examine the consolidation of DHL air operations under UPS   If the consolidation of these competitors  air services is successful  at least 8 000 jobs will likely be eliminated throughout the state of Ohio   In the letter  Obama calls on the White House to urge the Department of Justice to examine the agreement to ensure it is not in violation of antitrust laws and  ask the Department of Labor to detail its efforts to assist these unemployed workers and whether the Department s response could serve as model for other communities experiencing concentrated job loss  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  Zinsmeister  During my recent travels  I visited with the mayor of Wilmington  Ohio and workers who would be affected by a proposed DHL UPS agreement for services that would lead to the closing of the DHL facility in Wilmington    I write to you in my capacity as a U S  Senator because I believe that the Administration must act now on two fronts  first  the Department of Justice should examine the transaction to ensure that it is not in violation of antitrust laws and second  if it is not  then the government must work to ensure that these workers and this community are not left without assistance in finding new work for its people and new use for the existing infrastructure   I am pleased that you and Assistant Secretary of Commerce Sandy Baruah have been tasked with coordinating the government response to the situation and wish to offer any assistance I or my staff can provide  As a matter of antitrust law  the proposed consolidation of DHL s domestic airlift operations under a competitor  UPS  raises concern   At the very least  the DOJ should examine whether having two competitors in a fairly concentrated market act as partners would have anti competitive effects  If the deal proceeds  Governor Strickland and Senator Brown have both told me that the DHL facility in Wilmington would likely cease operating   That would eliminate at least 8 000 jobs in Ohio and impact an estimated 41 counties   That level of concentrated job loss strongly weighs in favor of the government assisting them through the difficult time that will follow   I understand that you are working with the Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce to coordinate a rapid response to what could be a crisis for the communities involved   As a Senator on the committee of jurisdiction over the Department of Labor  I would appreciate additional detail on your efforts and how responding to this situation could serve as a model for other communities where concentrated job loss is occurring due to plants moving overseas or increasingly consolidating markets   Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator  Cc  Sandy Baruah  Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development                               Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
