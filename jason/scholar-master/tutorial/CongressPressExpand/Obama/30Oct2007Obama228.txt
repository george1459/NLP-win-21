2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Max Gleischman  DURBIN  Blackwater May Have Misclassified Workers  Cheated American Taxpayers WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to U S  Treasury Secretary Henry M  Paulson asking for a full investigation and audit of how Blackwater USA classifies its workers  Initial investigations into this issue by House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman suggest that Blackwater has classified workers as independent contractors so as to avoid paying payroll taxes  which could deprive taxpayers of millions of dollars and shortchange employees by denying them overtime pay and workers  compensation  In September  Senators Obama and Durbin  along with Senators Kennedy and Murray  introduced S 2044  The Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act of 2007  which will close a tax loophole that allows employers to classify a worker an  independent contractor  instead of an  employee  to avoid paying employment taxes and workers compensation for their workers   It will also encourage improved enforcement of existing tax and labor laws related to worker misclassification through strengthened coordination between the Departments of Labor and Treasury  improved access to information for workers  and by establishing the right of workers to challenge their classification without fear of employer retaliation    The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Paulson  We are writing to ask for a full investigation and audit of Blackwater USA s practice of classifying many of its personnel as independent contractors instead of employees   As House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman recently found  Blackwater may have enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage over other contractors if its classification were incorrect  and as a result  may owe the American taxpayer millions of dollars in Social Security  Medicare  and unemployment taxes   Misclassification of workers as independent contractors is a widespread problem in our country  but it is particularly disturbing that a government contractor of Blackwater s scope may be engaged in it   According to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   the misclassification of workers accounts for 30 40 percent of the  20 billion annual federal employment tax gap and can also lead to the loss of basic worker protections under labor law   As you may know  we introduced S  2044  the Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act  ICPC   earlier this year to improve enforcement of existing laws protecting workers from misclassification and laws ensuring that employers comply with their employment tax obligations   The legislation also modifies the Section 530 safe harbor in tax law that currently encourages misclassification and protects some employers engaged in it  The Section 530 safe harbor in tax law requires the IRS to excuse misclassification for employment tax purposes and allow an employer to continue reporting employees as independent contractors if the employer  1  has been treating similarly situated workers as independent contractors   2  has been consistently reporting the workers as independent contractors to the IRS and has been issuing 1099 s to the workers  or  3  has a reasonable basis to classify employees as subcontractors   The reasonable basis test is satisfied if the employer meets any one of the following   a  the employer reasonably relied on a court decision or IRS ruling issued to the employer   b  it was the subject of an IRS employment classification audit that did not result in any  assessment        for misclassification  or  c  it relied on a long standing practice of a significant segment of the industry  We are concerned that Blackwater may be violating the law by inappropriately classifying its workers as independent contractors   It is difficult to fathom how Blackwater employees in Iraq can be considered independent contractors   They are trained by Blackwater  paid by Blackwater  and told whom to guard by Blackwater   These are not independent small businessmen establishing their own individual working relationships with those they are hired to protect In a statement to the Associated Press  a Blackwater spokeswoman said the company has appealed an IRS ruling related to a specific Blackwater associate where the IRS determined that the worker had been misclassified    The spokeswoman further stated that the Small Business Administration  SBA  told the company that Blackwater security guards do not have to be classified as company employees   We do not believe it is appropriate for Blackwater  or any private company  to rely on the SBA for tax classification determinations either under Section 530 or any other provision of law and ask you for clarification   The Blackwater case is a perfect example of the failure of tax enforcement and the need for reform of the Section 530 provision   That provision currently bars the IRS from writing rules  regulations  or guidance on complying with the law   Without the ability to provide direction to employers and its own auditors  the IRS is left with piecemeal enforcement that  at best  creates confusion among businesses  and at worst  allows companies like Blackwater to purposefully evade the law    Our legislation is pending before Congress  and we look forward to working with you on it   In the interim  we ask that you open a full investigation into Blackwater s classification practices  Sincerely     Senator Barack Obama  Senator Dick Durbin                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be
