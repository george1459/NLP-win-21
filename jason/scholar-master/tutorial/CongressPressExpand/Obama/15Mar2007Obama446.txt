   Obama Statement on Senate Vote Blocking Troop Redeployment   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Senate Vote Blocking Troop Redeployment Thursday  March 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact  Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Barack Obama today supported a resolution that would redeploy American combat troops from Iraq by a target date of March 31  2008  the same date in the Iraq De escalation Act that he introduced in January   Obama supported other measures that ensure our troops in Iraq are protected as redeployment proceeds     I am disappointed that today Senate Republicans blocked a redeployment plan  similar to the Iraq De escalation Act I introduced  that would set a target date of March 31  2008 to remove our combat troops from Iraq   Both the de escalation plan I introduced  and Senator Reid   s resolution  would protect our troops as they are redeployed from Iraq and allow the process of political reconciliation to proceed   I am pleased  however  that Congress overwhelmingly affirmed its power of the purse as a means to pressure the Bush administration to begin redeploying our troops without endangering those that remain in the field
