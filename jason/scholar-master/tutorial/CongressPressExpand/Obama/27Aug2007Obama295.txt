                                                        Durbin  Obama Urge France to Reconsider Decision to Deny U S  Request for Extradition of Confessed Chicago Murderer Monday  August 27  2007  For Immediate Release   Contact  Sandra Abrevaya  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urging France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago  Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities and confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after allegedly committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson s extradition   On August 23  France announced their decision not to extradite Peterson  Last week  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d Affaires Fran  ois Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States  request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case  August 24  2007  The Honorable M  Bernard Kouchner   Foreign Minister  Ministry of Foreign Affairs   37  Quai d Orsay   F   75351 PARIS  Dear Mr  Minister   Congratulations on your appointment as Foreign Minister   You have had an impressive career pre dating this assignment  and your strong efforts have continued in your first months in this new position   We are writing in relation to an issue of great importance to Americans in my state of Illinois and of intense personal interest to us  the criminal investigation into the murder of Dr  David Cornbleet   Dr  Cornbleet  an American citizen in Chicago  Illinois  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   It is our understanding that Mr  Hans Peterson  also an American citizen  has confessed to the murder of Dr  Cornbleet  and is currently in the custody of French authorities in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Hans Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder   We wrote earlier this week to the French Charg   d   Affaires in Washington  Fran  ois Rivasseau  underscoring our strong support for this extradition request   However  we learned from a letter from the Ministry of Justice to the U S  Department of Justice on August 22  as well as from a response to our letter that we received today from Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau  that the Ministry of Justice considers the American born  U S  citizen Peterson to also be a French national and that the extradition request has been denied   These communications    which cite Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France as the primary basis for the decision not to extradite   are a blow to the Cornbleet family and to all Illinoisans    Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in pertinent part that    There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State      While this Article does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state  it also does not appear to preclude extradition   To the extent there is discretion available in such extradition decisions  we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition   We believe the specific facts of this case justify Mr  Peterson   s extradition   As you may know  after Dr  Cornbleet s death  Mr  Peterson traveled to St  Martin in the French West Indies   In May 2007  Mr  Peterson sought and obtained a French passport after Mr  Peterson s American former roommates contacted the Chicago Police Department to report their suspicions that Peterson was involved in Dr  Cornbleet s murder   In June 2007  the State s Attorney s Office in Cook County  Illinois  confirmed that Mr  Peterson   s DNA was found at the crime scene and issued a warrant for Mr  Peterson s arrest   In August 2007  Mr  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and allegedly confessed to murdering Dr  Cornbleet      After apparently living his entire life in the United States and under the protection of U S  laws  it appears that Mr  Peterson committed a heinous crime  fled the United States for French territory  and then asserted a claim to French citizenship in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Mr  Peterson face trial in the United States   We strongly urge the Government of France to reconsider its decision to deny the extradition request for Mr  Peterson and to allow him to face charges in the nation where the crime he confessed to was committed    We ask you for the favor of a swift response    Sincerely     Barack Obama    U S  Senator   Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator                                                    cc   The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State
