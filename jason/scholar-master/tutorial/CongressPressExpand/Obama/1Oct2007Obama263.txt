       Obama Iraq Security Contractors Amendment Wins Approval in Senate Friday  September 28  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Legislation demands answers on role of contractors in Iraq WASHINGTON  D C      Last night  the United States Senate accepted an amendment to the Defense Department Authorization bill introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  that will require federal departments to compile and report information to Congress on the role of private security contractors in Iraq         There are too many unanswered questions about the role of private security contractors in Iraq and it   s time for answers     Senator Obama said      The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent in Iraq and the role that security contractors are playing   This legislation will start getting the information we need to make sure their operations are going forth in a way that doesn   t hinder our military   s efforts to bring this war to a responsible end  I reiterate my calls on President Bush to immediately begin bringing these answers to Congress       Obama originally offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February   With an estimated 48 000 private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following    Specifically  Obama   s amendment will direct federal departments and agencies to report to Congress on the following within 90 days  The total number of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan The companies awarded these contracts The total cost of the contractors And the process by which federal departments will track the number of contractors killed or wounded Within 180 days  the Department of Defense will have to submit a report to Congress on its strategy for using contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  a description of the activities being carried out by contractors  and a strategy for ensuring that contractors do not perform inherently governmental functions and that they are not supervising other U S  government personnel   Obama wrote to Secretary Rice today continuing to push for answers on the Blackwater incident and on the role of contractors in general    The text of the letter is below  September 28  2007 The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State   2201 C Street  NW   Washington  DC 20520 Dear Madam Secretary   I am writing regarding the September 16 incident in Baghdad involving the State Department s security escort  which consists of armed private contractors from the firm Blackwater USA   According to press accounts of that incident  Blackwater contractors killed at 11 Iraqis and wounded 12 others   This incident and a pattern of similar incidents described in press accounts raise larger questions about the role of private contractors in Iraq     who carry out what had once been viewed as inherently governmental functions   Tens of thousands of private security employees are operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors have died in Iraq since 2003   As the recent incident in Baghdad illustrates  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  what military and safety equipment they are provided  and what rules of engagement they are following   For this reason  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February   This legislation would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of those contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The legislation would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct engaged in by contractors   The FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  includes several provisions from S  674  and similar provisions have been included in the House version of the bill  In an effort to learn more about Blackwater s operations in Iraq  I am interested in getting your reaction to several issues under the jurisdiction of the Department of State  1   The press has reported several other instances involving Blackwater  including a reported shooting of the Iraqi Vice President s security guard inside the Green Zone on Christmas Eve 2006  reported shootings of Interior Ministry employees  and reported armed standoffs between Blackwater employees and Iraqi police   It has also been claimed by U S  officials quoted in media reports that the State Department was informed of this pattern  but failed to take action against the firm   Has the Department investigated these or other incidents   If so  what were the legal or contractual results of those investigations   2   Following the recent incident in Baghdad  the Iraqi government reportedly banned Blackwater from operating in Iraq   The resulting ban on Blackwater   s operations reportedly caused the entire U S  diplomatic effort within Iraq to cease operations  preventing State Department from even leaving the Green Zone to carry out their jobs for several days   How did the U S  government become so dependent on just one company in order to carry out its mandated missions   What reforms are being implemented to prevent such vulnerabilities for inherently governmental operations in the future   Given the obvious needs  will you be rebuilding the Department s Diplomatic Security office  or will you continue to rely on contractors in a way that could lead to similar problems and vulnerabilities in the future   3   Last year  Congress enacted and the President signed into law a provision stating that contractors operating in contingency operations would potentially fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice  UCMJ    Is it your view that any illegal actions committed by armed private contractors in Iraq would be punishable under the UCMJ  as Iraq is a contingency operation and they are civilians accompanying the force in the pursuit of that mission   If not  under what legal process would they be held accountable   How many contractors have been held accountable for past incidents over the last four years of operations in Iraq   4   It has also been reported that two former members of the Blackwater firm have pled guilty to the illegal transfer of American made weaponry to the PKK  Kurdistan Workers Party   an organization that is designated as a  foreign terrorist organization  by your own Department   What were the effects of the Turkish government s discovery of U S  weapons in a terrorist group s hands    apparently facilitated by private contractor personnel   Has this incident harmed U S  relations with our NATO ally Turkey and your wider efforts to ensure stability and democracy in the region   5   Lastly  I am concerned about the impact of this incident  as well as others since the private contractor role at Abu Ghraib  on our overall effort to win the wider  war of ideas  that is required to defeat terrorism   This recent incident and other incidents have been widely reported in the Muslim world  with negative implications for U S  efforts   The result is that not only are the private contractors being blamed  but so is the U S  government   Has the State Department conducted an analysis of the consequences of turning over such functions in a contingency operation zone to private contractors   Is this outsourcing actually hurting  rather than helping  our public diplomacy efforts  especially our efforts to win  hearts and minds    The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent and whether American civilian contractors are following applicable laws   Unfortunately  recent press accounts    particularly those alluding to the State Department s obstruction of a House investigation    suggest that the Department is not interested in a full accounting of Blackwater s actions or in ensuring adequate oversight of Blackwater and other private security contractors   The U S  government must ensure an expedited resolution to these troubling developments  I look forward to your timely responses to my inquiries   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
