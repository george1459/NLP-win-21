   Kennedy  Specter  Obama  Senators Work to Overturn Supreme Court Decision on Pay Discrimination   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Kennedy  Specter  Obama  Senators Work to Overturn Supreme Court Decision on Pay Discrimination Friday  July 20  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  No American Should be Denied Equal Pay for Equal Work      Led Better Decision Undermines American Principles WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Obama  D IL  joined a bipartisan group of fourteen Senators  led by Senators Kennedy and Specter  to introduce the Fair Pay Restoration Act  a bill to overturn the Supreme Court   s recent 5 4 decision in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  which undermined the basic protection against pay discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964   The decision also undermines pay discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  The bill would restore the clear intent of Congress that workers must have a reasonable time to file a pay discrimination claim after they become victims of discriminatory compensation       I was deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court   s ruling in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company     said Senator Obama      Contrary to Congress    intent and longstanding precedent  the conservative majority held that workers may not sue their employers for pay discrimination that originated years earlier     even if the unequal pay continues today   This strikes at the heart of equality in this country      Obama added      As Justice Ginsburg explained in her dissent  this ruling will make it extremely difficult to remedy gender and racial discrimination in the workplace under Title VII   Workers will often not discover that they have been discriminated against until years after the initial decision to issue unequal pay checks   At a time when women only earn 77 cents to every dollar that a man makes  we simply cannot let this decision stand   That is why I am pleased to join this bi partisan group of Senators to introduce common sense legislation to overturn this decision and make sure that all workers receive the guarantee of equal pay for equal work       The supporters of this bill believe that no American should be denied equal pay for equal work  Employees    ability to provide for their children  save for retirement  and enjoy the benefit of their labor should not be limited by discrimination  The Court   s decision undermined these bedrock principles by imposing unrealistically short time limits on such claims    The House Committee on Education and Labor recently passed the bill   s House counterpart  and the bill is ready for floor action in the House   The bill   s co sponsors are Senators Kennedy  D MA   Specter  R PA   Obama  D IL   Harkin  D IA   Snowe  R ME   Clinton  D NY   Mikulski  D MD   Durbin  D IL   Dodd  D CT   Leahy  D VT   McCaskill  D MO   Whitehouse  D RI   Boxer  D CA   Stabenow  D MI  and Murray  D WA    Below is a summary of the bill   The Fair Pay Restoration Act The Fair Pay Restoration Act would clarify that the laws against pay discrimination apply to every paycheck or other compensation a worker receives   The bill   s protection would extend to pay discrimination based on race  national origin  gender  religious  age or disability   The bill overturns Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Co   a divided Supreme Court held that workers must sue for pay discrimination within 180 days after the original pay setting decision  no matter how long the unfair pay continues       Under the case  it doesn   t matter if the discrimination is still ongoing today  and the worker initially had no way of knowing that others were being paid more for the same work  So workers receiving an unfairly low wage today could still be out of time to hold the company accountable if they did not discover the discrimination soon after it first began  The Fair Pay Restoration Act will   Restores a fair  reasonable time limit for filing pay discrimination claims   The bill would start the clock for filing pay discrimination claims when compensation is received  rather than when the employer decides to discriminate  Each discriminatory paycheck would restart the clock for filing a pay discrimination claim   As long as workers file their claims within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck  their charges will be considered timely   Retains a fair limit on the amount employers owe   Under the Kennedy bill  employers would not have to make up for salary differences that occurred decades ago  Current law limits back pay in job discrimination cases to two years before the worker filed a discrimination claim   The bill would not change this two year limit on back pay   Restores Congressional intent   The bill mirrors language prohibiting discriminatory seniority systems  which was included in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1991  The 1991 Act was signed by the first President Bush in 1991 with broad bipartisan support  passing the House 381 38 and the Senate 93 to 5
