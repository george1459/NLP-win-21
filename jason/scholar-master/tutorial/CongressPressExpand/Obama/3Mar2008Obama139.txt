   Obama Statement on NATO Summit in Romania   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Obama Statement on NATO Summit in Romania Monday  March  3  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the NATO Summit in Bucharest  Romania next month   From April 2 to 4  2008  leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  will meet at a summit in Bucharest  Romania  to address issues critical to American national security and the future of the Euro Atlantic community  NATO leaders must seize this opportunity to strengthen transatlantic ties  augment alliance members  contributions to common missions and continue to build the integrated  stable and prosperous Europe that is a vital interest of the United States   A top priority for the summit must be to reinforce NATO s critical mission in Afghanistan  The contributions there of all the NATO allies alongside more than a dozen other countries bears testimony to how the alliance can contribute to the 21st century missions that are vital to the security of the United States and its allies  NATO s involvement provides capabilities  legitimacy  and coordination in Afghanistan that simply would not be available if NATO did not exist   Success in Afghanistan is vital to the security of the United States  to all NATO members  and to the people of Afghanistan  NATO s leaders must therefore send an unambiguous message that every country in NATO will do whatever needs to be done to destroy terrorist networks in Afghanistan  to prevent the Taliban from returning to power  and to bring greater security and well being to the Afghan people  This will require adequate numbers of capable military forces and civilian personnel from NATO members and putting more of an Afghan face on counter insurgency operations by providing more training and resources to the Afghan National Army and police forces  and by embedding more Afghan forces in NATO missions  We must also win long term public support through assistance programs that make a difference in the lives of the Afghan people  including investments in infrastructure and education  the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers to undermine the Taliban and other drug traffickers  and increased efforts to combat corruption through safeguards on assistance and support for the rule of law   Success in Afghanistan will also require the removal of restrictions that some allies have placed on their forces in Afghanistan  which hamper the flexibility of commanders on the ground  The mission in Afghanistan  legitimized by a United Nations mandate  supported by the Afghan people  and endorsed by all NATO members after the United States was attacked is central to NATO s future as a collective security organization  Afghanistan presents a test of whether NATO can carry out the crucial missions of the 21st century  and NATO must come together to meet that challenge  Now is the time for all NATO allies to recommit to this common purpose   The summit must also address the question of the alliance expanding membership  NATO enlargement since the end of the Cold War has helped the countries of Central and Eastern Europe become more stable and democratic  It has also added to NATO military capability by facilitating contributions from new members to critical missions such as Afghanistan   The three current candidates for NATO membership  Albania  Croatia and the Republic of Macedonia  have each made great strides in consolidating their new democracies  They have reformed their defense establishments  worked to root out corruption  modernized their economies  and contributed to NATO security missions in the Balkans and Afghanistan  Responding to these efforts with NATO membership at the upcoming summit would add to the alliance military capabilities while contributing to stability in the Balkans  a region still suffering from the ethnic tensions left behind by the bloodshed of the 1990s   Ukraine and Georgia have also been developing their ties with NATO  Their leaders have declared their readiness to advance a NATO Membership Action Plan  MAP  to prepare for the rights and obligations of membership  They are working to consolidate democratic reforms and to undertake new responsibilities in their relationship with the Alliance  I welcome the desire and actions of these countries to seek closer ties with NATO and hope that NATO responds favorably to their request  consistent with its criteria for membership  Whether Ukraine and Georgia ultimately join NATO will be a decision for the members of the alliance and the citizens of those countries  after a period of open and democratic debate  But they should receive our help and encouragement as they continue to develop ties to Atlantic and European institutions   NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia  Russia has an important role to play in European and global affairs and should see NATO as a partner  not as a threat  But we should oppose any efforts by the Russian government to intimidate its neighbors or control their foreign policies  Russia cannot have a veto over which countries join the alliance  Since the end of the Cold War  Republican and Democratic administrations have supported the independence and sovereignty of all the states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union  and we must continue to do so  President Putin recent threat to point missiles at Ukraine is simply not the way to promote the peaceful 21st century Europe we seek   NATO stands as an example of how the United States can advance American national security  and the security of the world  through a strong alliance rooted in shared responsibility and shared values  NATO remains a vital asset in America s efforts to anchor democracy and stability in Europe and to defend our interests and values all over the world  The Bucharest summit provides an opportunity to advance these goals and to reinforce a vital alliance  NATO s leaders must seize that opportunity
