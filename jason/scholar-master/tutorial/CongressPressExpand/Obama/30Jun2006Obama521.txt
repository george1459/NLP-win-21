   Obama Statement on Flag Burning Amendment   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Flag Burning Amendment Tuesday  June 27  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green   312  886 0480  Date  June 27  2006 Obama Statement on Flag Burning Amendment   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  released the following statement on the flag burning amendment     I cannot imagine anything more abhorrent to a veteran than seeing the flag they fought for being burned to make a political point  I too have great pride in our flag  I share outrage at the thought of it being disrespected  And though I have never seen anyone burn a flag  if I did  it would take every ounce of restraint I had not to haul off and hit them       But we live in a country of laws  Laws are what stop people from resorting to physical violence to settle disagreements  and laws are what protect free speech  And when I became a Senator  I swore an oath to protect the Constitution  Under that oath  my first allegiance is not to a political party  or to an ideology  or to a president  or even to popular opinion  but to the Constitution and to the rule of law     The Framers made it difficult to amend the Constitution because our founding document should not be changed just because of political concerns or temporary problems  And even the strongest supporters of this amendment are hard pressed to find more than a few instances of flag burning each year  Those problems were left to be solved through legislation  and I support legislation introduced by Senator Durbin that makes it illegal to burn the flag without changing the Constitution  The Constitution has only been amended 27 times  These amendments include guarantees of our most basic freedoms  the freedom of religion  the right to a trial by jury  the protection against cruel punishment     Today  there are hundreds of thousands of U S  troops risking their lives for their country  looking to us to come up with a plan to win the peace so they can come home  Across America  there are millions who are looking for us to do something about health care  about education  about energy  The Senate will likely be in session for about 50 more days for the rest of this year  To spend the precious time we have left battling an epidemic of flag burning that does not exist is a disservice to our country      As Richard Savage of Bloomington  Illinois wrote to me   I am a Vietnam veteran and Republican        Those who would burn the flag destroy the symbol of freedom  but amending the Constitution would destroy part of freedom itself    Mr  Savage is right  which is why I will vote against this amendment  Senator Durbin s amendment is a way forward to balance our respect for the flag with reverence for the Constitution
