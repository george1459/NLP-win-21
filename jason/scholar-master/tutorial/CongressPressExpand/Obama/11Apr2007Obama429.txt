   Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans Tuesday  April 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt Homes for Heroes Act would provide support to nation   s 200 000 veterans in need WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  was today joined by Senators Charles Schumer  D NY   Robert Menendez  D NJ   and Sherrod Brown  D OH  in introducing the Homes for Heroes Act  a bill that would expand housing and rental assistance for homeless veterans   The Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  estimates that approximately 200 000 adult veterans live on the streets or in shelters on any given day  and nearly twice as many are homeless at some point during the year       As we work to end the war in Iraq  we must also prepare to deal with the generation of service members returning home from war     said Senator Obama      As long as there are veterans or veteran family members searching for shelter on the streets  and as long as there are wounded service members receiving substandard medical care  we have failed in our duty to honor the commitment of the brave men and women who chose to serve   We must provide our returning heroes and their families with every resource they need to rebuild their lives          As we   ve seen at Walter Reed and elsewhere  our veterans returning from war have not received the help and resources they deserve     said Senator Schumer      The thousands of homeless veterans are just another stark example of how the Administration has let our veterans down  This bill will right this wrong by providing the men and women who have served our country with housing assistance   Too many veterans need a roof over their heads and it   s time we provide it now      Senator Robert Menendez said     A grateful nation should work to ensure that the men and women who risked their lives serving their country are not left stranded when they fall on hard times back home  Just as we have acted to improve health care for injured veterans  we should act to make sure veterans can put a roof over their heads          There are more than 2 000 homeless veterans in Ohio  They fought for us  We should fight for them  That s what this bill is about  and I am proud to support it     Senator Brown said   The    Homes for Heroes Act    will address these concerns by   I  Establishing Permanent Housing and Services for Low Income Veterans   Families The bill would expand the supply of permanent affordable housing for low income veteran families  This would not only provide shelter for homeless veteran families  but also help prevent low income families from falling into homelessness   The bill establishes a  225 million assistance program for community and nonprofit organizations to purchase  build or rehabilitate housing for low income veterans    The organizations would also coordinate with the VA and HUD to provide supportive services including substance abuse and mental health counseling  vocational and employment training  transportation  child care and other services to help veterans live independently   Tenants would pay a certain percentage of their income as rent   II  Expanding Rental Assistance The legislation would expand the highly successful HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  HUD VASH  Program  authorizing 20 000 vouchers annually and making the program permanent   The current authorization expires at the end of 2011 and only provides a small fraction of the vouchers needed to meet demand  currently  only 2 500 are authorized in FY 2011    This program provides permanent housing subsidies and case management services to homeless veterans with mental and addictive disorders   The VA and HUD coordinate to screen and provide services for recipients  III  Focusing Government Resources on Homeless Veterans The bill would establish the position of Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within the Department of Housing and Urban Development to coordinate services to homeless veterans and serve as a liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs  state and local officials and nonprofit service organizations  The bill also places additional priority on veterans by requiring all local public housing agencies to come up with plans to address the needs of homeless veterans as part of their five year comprehensive housing affordability strategy submitted to HUD    The bill also calls for comprehensive reports to Congress on the housing needs of homeless veterans and the steps the government is taking to address them   IV  Exclusion of Veterans Benefits from Rent Considerations The bill would prohibit benefits received by any member of a family from the VA from being included as income for the purposes of determining the amount of rent paid by a family for occupancy of a dwelling unit assisted under a federally assisted housing program  or in housing assisted under a federally assisted housing program  V  Assistance to Housing Service Providers The bill authorizes  1 million in grants for assistance to service providers during the application process and to assist with the execution of their projects  Senator Obama has also sponsored the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  S  713  and the Lane Evans Mental Health Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act  S  117  to reform medical treatment for soldiers and veterans
