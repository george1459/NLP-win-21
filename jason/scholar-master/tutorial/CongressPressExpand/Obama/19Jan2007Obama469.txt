   Obama Statement on Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Iraq Wednesday  January 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 17  2007  Obama Statement on Iraq    Throughout the war in Iraq  we have been given assurance after assurance by our government only to find out that facts on the ground reflect a completely different reality       Last week  after being told by President Bush that his plan to escalate this war would be well planned  well coordinated  and well supported by the Iraqi government  we find out in this week s New York Times that none of this is true   Military officials tell us that there is no clear chain of command between Iraqis and U S  commanders and no real indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership       I cannot in good conscience support this plan   As I first said two months ago  we should not be sending more U S  troops to Iraq  we should begin redeploying them to let the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever and to pressure the Sunnis  Shiites  and Kurds to finally reach a political settlement     Escalation is a failed policy opposed by generals  Democrats and Republicans  and now even the Iraqis themselves  and the fact that the President is already moving ahead with this idea is a terrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad  open ended authority to wage this war in 2002     It now falls on Congress to find a way to support our troops in the field while still preventing the President from multiplying his previous mistakes   That is why I not only favor capping the number U S  troops in Iraq  but believe it s imperative that we begin the phased redeployment I called for two months ago  and intend to introduce legislation that does just that
