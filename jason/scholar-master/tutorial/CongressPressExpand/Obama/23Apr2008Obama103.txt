   Senator Obama Votes to Support the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Senator Obama Votes to Support the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act Wednesday  April 23  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Michael Ortiz   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama voted in favor of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act  H R  2831    This bill is aimed at reversing a Supreme Court ruling that made it harder for working women  like Lilly Ledbetter  to hold their employers accountable for pay discrimination  After Senator Obama met with Ledbetter in the U S  Capitol  he released the following statement   Today  too many women are still earning less than men for doing the same work  making it harder for working families to make ends meet  harder for single mothers to climb out of poverty  and harder for elderly women to afford their retirement  That kind of pay discrimination is wrong and has no place in the United States of America    And this evening  we have a chance to do something about it   The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would overturn an unfair Supreme Court decision that made it harder for working women to sue their employers for pay discrimination    Passing this bill is an important step in closing the pay gap  something I helped to do in Illinois  and something I ve fought to do since I arrived in the Senate  I ve co sponsored legislation to ensure that women receive equal pay for equivalent work and to require that employers disclose their pay scales for various kinds of jobs  This information will allow women to determine whether they are being discriminated against   information they often lack right now    We also have to strengthen enforcement of existing laws by increasing the EEOC s funding and staffing  and ensuring that its members have a strong commitment to ending discrimination    In the end  closing the pay gap is essential  but that alone will not be enough to make sure that women and girls have an equal shot at the American dream  We also need to update the social contract in this country to reflect the realities that working women face each day    It s wrong that 40  of working women in this country do not have a single day of paid sick leave  We should require employers to provide seven paid sick days each year  We should also enforce laws that prohibit caregiver discrimination  double federal funding for quality after school programs  and encourage flexible work schedules to help parents balance work and family  That s how we ll build a more just and equal America    And that s what this bill is about  It s a common sense measure to restore justice and equality in the workplace  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration is siding with the special interests and has threatened to veto it  something it has done only a handful of times in the past seven and a half years    I believe that if you work hard and do a good job  you should be rewarded no matter what you look like  where you come from  or what gender you are  That s why I m supporting this bill and that s why I urge my colleagues to do the same                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
