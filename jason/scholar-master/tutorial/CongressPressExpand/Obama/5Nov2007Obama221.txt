   Obama Introduces Resolution to Halt Rush to War with Iran   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Introduces Resolution to Halt Rush to War with Iran Friday  November  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5566 Legislation would undo damage caused by Senate   s passage of Kyl Lieberman amendment WASHINGTON  D C      Yesterday evening  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  introduced Senate Joint Resolution 23  a legislative proposal specifying that the use of force against Iran is not authorized by any previous action of Congress   This would include the authorization of the use of force against Iraq  the recently passed Kyl Lieberman amendment  which states that our military presence in Iraq should be used to counter Iran  and any resolution previously adopted by Congress   There is absolutely no reason to trust that this Administration will not use existing congressional authorization to justify military action against Iran   said Senator Obama   The Iraq War authorization and the recently passed Kyl Lieberman amendment have opened the door to an attack on Iran  and Congress must now shut that door  We need aggressive diplomacy and economic pressure  which is why I support sanctions on Iran  Those efforts must not be linked to the use of our military presence in Iraq and the region  because we have seen what this Administration does when you trust them to do the right thing but give them an opening to do the wrong thing     Given concerns about the Bush Administration   s expansive view of executive authority  and the likelihood that any attack on Iran would come from our military presence already in Iraq and the region  this resolution is necessary to remove any suggestion that Kyl Lieberman or any other existing provision of law or resolution authorizes the President to attack Iran  Instead  the President will have to get specific statutory authorization from the Congress to use force against Iran   The text of the joint resolution is below  Clarifying that the use of force against Iran is not authorized by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq  any resolution previously adopted  or any other provision of law  Whereas the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq  Public Law 107 243  authorized the President  to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to      1  defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq  and  2  enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq     Whereas  on September 26  2007  the Senate agreed to a provision  Senate Amendment 3017 to Senate Amendment 2011 to H R  1585  stating the sense of the Senate that     the manner in which the United States transitions and structures its military presence in Iraq will have critical long term consequences for the future of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East  in particular with regard to the capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pose a threat to the security of the region     Whereas  on September 26  2007  the Senate also stated the sense of the Senate  that it is a critical national interest of the United States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from turning Shi   a militia extremists in Iraq into a Hezbollah like force that could serve its interests inside Iraq     Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of State designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  IRGC  and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics  MODAFL  as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction under Executive Order 13382 in relation to concerns about their role in proliferation activities  Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of the Treasury also designated 9 IRGC affiliated entities and 5 IRGC affiliated individuals  as derivatives of the IRGC  as well as Iran   s state owned Bank Melli and Bank Mellat and 3 individuals affiliated with Iran   s Aerospace Industries Organization  AIO   as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction or supporters of terrorism under Executive Order 13382  Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of the Treasury also designated the IRGC Qods Force  IRGC QF  as a supporter of terrorism for providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations  and designated Iran   s state owned Bank Saderat as a terrorist financier  under Executive Order 13224  and Whereas any offensive military action taken by the United States against Iran must be explicitly authorized by Congress  Now therefore be it  Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled  That nothing in the Authorization for the Use of Force Against Iraq  Public Law 107 243   any act that serves as the statutory authority for Executive Order 13382 or Executive Order 13224  any resolution previously adopted  or any other provision of law including the terms of Executive Order 13382 or Executive Order 13224 shall be construed to authorize  encourage  or in any way address the use of Armed Forces of the United States against Iran
