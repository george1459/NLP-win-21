   Statement from Senator Barack Obama on the Situation in Tibet   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Statement from Senator Barack Obama on the Situation in Tibet Wednesday  April 23  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the crisis in Tibet   A negotiated settlement between China and the Dalai Lama remains the best hope for a resolution of the crisis in Tibet   Right now  the most important thing is to seize this moment when the world s attention is focused on Tibet to reach an agreement that will guarantee religious freedom for the Tibetan people  protect Tibetan culture and language  and provide meaningful autonomy for Tibetans in the areas of economic development and environmental protection   The Dalai Lama has met all of the conditions that China requires for dialogue to succeed   The Dalai Lama recognizes that Tibet is part of China  and he does not advocate independence for Tibet   The Dalai Lama supports engagement and dialogue with China   Even after the recent violence  the Dalai Lama has indicated his continued support for holding the Olympic Games in Beijing   And the Dalai Lama acknowledges that China has brought economic development to the Tibetan plateau  improving the standard of living for millions of Tibetans     Most importantly  the Dalai Lama is a man of peace   I had the privilege of speaking with the Dalai Lama during his trip this month to the U S   He reiterated to me that he continues to condemn the violence that erupted recently in Lhasa and other Tibetan cities   This commitment to peace  non violence and religious tolerance is why the United States Congress honored the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal last October   China should recognize the opportunity that exists to begin a new chapter in Tibet s troubled history   That new beginning should start with an understanding of the origins of the recent unrest   There is little mystery about why Tibetans remain unhappy   The Tibetans who took to the streets in March were clear about their grievances   They want the freedom to practice their religion and maintain their culture without state interference   rights guaranteed to China s nationalities under the PRC s constitution   and they seek a meaningful voice in Tibetan affairs     For decades  China has kept tight controls on Tibetan Buddhism  and for decades China has directed the economic affairs of Tibet without listening to the Tibetan people   China s repressive policies are not unique to Tibet   Chinese in other parts of the country also routinely express their frustration at the government s failure to respect their fundamental human rights     The fact that Tibetan unrest is not unique also tells me that the United States response to the unrest must go beyond simple condemnations of China s conduct   We need to redouble our efforts inside Tibet   with funding for non governmental organization such as the Bridge Fund   to strengthen the voice of the Tibetan people in the areas of economic development and cultural preservation   And throughout China  we need to do much more to foster respect for the rule of law  religious freedom  transparency  and accountability in government   China s heavy hand in Tibet is a symptom of a much larger problem   the failure of the Chinese government to listen to the legitimate grievances of its people and to respond constructively to those complaints                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
