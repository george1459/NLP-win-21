   Obama Introduces Bill to Limit Use of Mercury   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Introduces Bill to Limit Use of Mercury Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt Recent report shows dangerously high mercury pollution continues to be produced  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today reintroduced the Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act  which prohibits the use of mercury in chlorine or caustic soda manufacturing by the year 2012   This legislation was prompted by an in depth report published by the Chicago Tribune that highlighted the extent of mercury contamination in the fish eaten by Americans   Much of the mercury emitted into the environment today is a result of chlorine and caustic soda production   Oceana  an environmental group  today released a report highlighting that several chlorine production plants continue to threaten public health through their mercury production       The level of mercury in the fish we eat continues to remain high  posing a particularly acute health threat to pregnant women and children     said Senator Obama      We know that mercury can cause serious developmental problems in children and problems affecting vision  motor skills  blood pressure  and fertility in adults   This bill will phase out the use of mercury in U S  plants that manufacture chlorine and caustic soda   Cost effective technology is available today to transition these plants to safer production processes  keeping all of us and our environment safer and healthier      Sampling conducted by the Chicago Tribune in late 2005 showed surprisingly high levels of mercury concentrations in freshwater and saltwater fish purchased by Chicago area consumers  fish like tuna  swordfish  orange roughy  and walleye  The Tribune also reported on how existing programs at the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have failed to adequately test and evaluate mercury levels in fish   As many as 630 000 children born annually in the U S  are at risk of neurological afflictions related to the consumption of mercury   And almost 10 percent of women in the U S  of childbearing age have mercury in their blood at a level that could put a baby at risk   The chlor alkali industry is one of the principal sources of the mercury production   Chlor alkali facilities manufacture chlorine gas and caustic soda  important chemicals that serve as the building blocks of many of the products and plastics essential to modern everyday life  For more than 100 years  mercury has been a key component in the chlorine process   Since 1974  however  about 115 plants worldwide have converted to better technologies such as membrane and diaphragm cells   Today in the United States  more than 90 percent of the chlor alkali industry has switched from using mercury to using these alternative catalysts   Moreover  of the 8 plants in the U S  that still use mercury  3 are in the process of stopping   The remaining 5  however  have made no such commitment   It is also worth noting that in 2005 alone  the 5 uncommitted mercury using plants reported that they released more than 4 400 pounds of mercury into the air  on average four times the average mercury releases of a standard coal fired power plant   The Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act  or M5 Act  prohibits using mercury cells in the chlorine or caustic soda manufacturing process by the year 2012  The M5 Act also puts procedures in place by mid year 2008 to track and report mercury input and output in the chlor alkali industry  The evidence suggests that between 2000 and 2004  the industry could not account for more than 130 tons of mercury  The EPA calls this    an enigma     The M5 Act addresses this enigma by tightening up mercury tracking requirements   This bill also provides for the transfer and storage of mercury from closed or closing facilities   And it directs the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Register to conduct a health assessment at those facilities that still use mercury after 2008   Obama originally introduced this legislation during the 109th Congress  along with the Mercury Market Minimization Act   In November 2006  Senator Obama called upon the Department of Energy to stop its proposed sale of large quantities of mercury  The Department subsequently announced it would not sell its stockpiles
