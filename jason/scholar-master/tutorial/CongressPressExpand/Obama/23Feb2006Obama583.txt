2007 Budget Monday  February  6  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 6  2006  Obama Statement on the 2007 Budget   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement about the proposed 2007 budget     Never before have Americans paid so much for a budget that does so little to keep them safe  secure  and prosperous in a 21st century economy   After years of shelling out billions in taxpayer dollars to well connected and well financed special interests  the President is facing a debt so large that he cannot afford the promises he s made to the American people     In the State of the Union  the President rightly praised our homeland defenders for their bravery  but gave us a budget that takes cops off the street and equipment from our firefighters   He called for us to stand united behind our troops  but his budget will cause 800 000 veterans to lose their health care   We heard about progress on crime and drugs  but see a budget with fewer resources to fight meth use at a time when local communities tell us it s the greatest threat to public safety   We heard about the need to make America more competitive in a 21st century economy  but now find out that thousands of students will be forced to give up college dreams as student aid is slashed for yet another year  And he talked about the importance of affordable health care  but he cut funding to provide health care to rural communities by 73 percent     The American people wanted to believe last Tuesday night that this President was ready to lead this country in a new direction  but they now see a budget that says more about this President s priorities than words ever can      In the months ahead  I look forward to working with members of both parties to end the special interest giveaways that have left us in debt so that we can finally keep the promise of a safer and more prosperous America     THE BUDGET BY THE NUMBERS  Unprecedented Fees on Military Retirees  The President is proposing an unprecedented increase in fees for military retirees using TRICARE  the military s managed care health program     By 2008  the President s plan would reportedly   Triple the TRICARE Prime enrollment fee for retired officers  from  230 to  750   Double enrollment fees for enlisted retirees  from  230 to  450   Double the deductibles for officers  from  150 to  300  and increase deductibles for enlisted members by 33 percent   150 to  200   Establish first ever enrollment fees for TRICARE Standard at  300 for officers and  200 for enlisted retirees  Increase TRICARE pharmacy co pays from  3 to  5 for generic drugs and from  9 to  15 for brand name drugs    Critics estimate that as many as 600 000 military retirees younger than 65 will drop out of TRICARE plans by 2015 because of the proposed fees    New Fees for Veterans Making More than  26 000  For the fourth year in a row  the President is proposing higher health fees and drug co payments for veterans  health care that would drive more than 213 000 veterans out of the VA system  The President would force veterans who do not have service connected disabilities and make more than an average of  25 842 to pay a new  250 annual enrollment fee for their medical care and would double their drug co payments from  8 to  15  for a 30 day supply    Continuing Ban on Middle Income Veterans with No Service Related Disabilities  The President  plan continues the ban on new Priority 8 enrollments  this includes veterans making more than  25 842 without a service related disability  Through this ban  the VA denied health care to 8 944 Illinois veterans last year  Nationally  more than 260 000 veterans were denied access to VA hospitals  clinics and medications last year  The VA s income cutoff varies by county  In Illinois  this averages  36 600 and ranges from a low of  27 350 in 36 rural and low income counties to  40 250 in the Chicago area  The 2005 national average for a single veteran was  25 842    Cuts Funding for Police Officers  The President s Budget cuts the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 80 percent   In 2005  COPS provided  7 4 million for hiring police officers in more than 60 Illinois Communities  Since 1994  the program has funded 5 854 police officers in Illinois with grants topping  416 million  Since 1994  Illinois has received more than  45 million in COPS grants to purchase crime fighting technologies   an average of  2 8 million per year in equipment that helps law enforcement save time  share information  and improve communications  The President s budget would completely eliminate funding for crime fighting technologies under the COPS program     Eliminate Funding to Fight Meth  The President would eliminate a critical source of assistance to police departments  the Byrne Memorial Grant Program  This year  more than 40 Illinois communities are splitting  12 9 million for Byrne Memorial Grants  Next year  they would receive nothing under the President s proposal  These grants help communities fight violent crime and provide assistance to victims of crime  Money provided by Byrne grants has been crucial in helping communities across Illinois join forces to combat this drug  In 2004 alone  Byrne grants helped Illinois cops make 1 267 methamphetamine related arrests and seize 348 923 grams of meth    Cuts Firefighters Assistance by 55 Percent  The President cuts funding for the Assistance for Firefighters Program by 55 percent from  629 million to  280 million  The program helps fire departments get critically needed equipment and training to protect the public  Illinois received 278 grants totaling  25 4 million for assistance to firefighters in 2005  If funding allocations remain the same next year  Illinois firefighters stand to lose  17 million from 2005   Freeze Need based Funding for College Students  The Bush budget freezes the maximum Pell grant at  4 050  for the fourth year in a row  despite rising tuition costs   In 1975  the Pell Grant covered 80 percent of the cost of a four year public college education   Today  that number is about 40 percent
