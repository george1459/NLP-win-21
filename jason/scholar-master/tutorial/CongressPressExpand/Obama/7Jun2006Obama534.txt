   Senators Obama and Bunning Introduce Legislation to Expand Coal Use   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Obama and Bunning Introduce Legislation to Expand Coal Use Wednesday  June  7  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs   202  228 5511  Bunning Contact  Mike Reynard   202  224 1156  Date  June 7  2006   Senators Obama and Bunning Introduce Legislation to Expand Coal Use   WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Jim Bunning  R KY  and Barack Obama  D IL  today announced that they have introduced S 3325  the  Coal To Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006    Joining this bipartisan legislation as original co sponsors are Senators Conrad Burns  R MT   Richard Lugar  R IN   Mark Pryor  D AR   and Lisa Murkowski  R AK    This comprehensive piece of legislation creates tax incentives for coal to liquids  CTL  technology and the construction of CTL plants   If passed  this legislation will help create the infrastructure needed to make CTL a viable energy resource throughout America    In the CTL process  coal is gasified  the gas is run through the Fischer Tropsch process  and the resulting fuel is refined into diesel  The final diesel product is cleaner than conventional diesel because most of the sulfur and nitrogen is removed during the Fischer Tropsch process  Currently  all the vehicles in South Africa run on fuels produced by Fischer Tropsch     Bunning said   The bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Obama will help create the infrastructure needed to get coal to liquids technology off the ground   CTL technology offers America the chance to capitalize on an abundant domestic resource that is found in eastern and western Kentucky  With a heavy investment into CTL  America will wean itself off of foreign sources of energy  and at the same time create jobs for working families back home   CTL is a viable  environmentally friendly energy resource  and will help cure America s addiction to oil    Obama said   The people I meet in town hall meetings back home would rather fill their cars with fuel made from coal reserves in Southern Illinois than with fuel made from crude reserves in Saudi Arabia  We already have the technology to do this in a way that s both clean and efficient  What we ve been lacking is the political will  This common sense  bipartisan legislation will greatly increase investment in coal to liquid fuel technology  which will create jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil  Illinois Basin Coal has more untapped energy potential than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined  Instead of enriching the Saudis  we can use these reserves to bring a renaissance for Illinois coal     The Coal to Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006 is a three part  comprehensive effort to create a vibrant domestic CTL fuel market  First  this bill enables the Department of Energy to provide loan guarantees for construction and loans for the necessary planning of CTL plants   Loan guarantees will encourage private investment and planning loans will help companies prepare a plant for construction  Second  this legislation will expand investment tax credits and expensing provisions to include coal to liquids plants and extend the Fuel Excise Tax credit  These tax incentives build on the loans and loan guarantees by offering tax breaks during the multiple year construction phase and during initial production at the plant  Third  this bill provides the Department of Defense the funding to purchase  test  and integrate these fuels into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve                                                                                                                                                                      Coal to Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006   On April 24th  Senator Jim Bunning  R KY  chaired an Energy Committee hearing on coal to liquids fuels   The committee heard testimony from the Department of Energy on the implementation of provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the committee discussed what additional authorizations may be needed   Bunning spoke with the Southern States Energy Board  individual companies engaging CTL technology  the National Mining Association  leading scientists including researchers at the University of Kentucky  and members of the environmental community   As a result of these discussions  Senators Bunning and Obama have composed a comprehensive piece of legislation that will create a backbone of CTL infrastructure in the United States   1  DOE Facilitation of Construction Loan Guarantees   Authorizes DOE to administer loan guarantees for the first CTL plants   These plants must have a minimum production of 10 000 barrels a day and the loan guarantee program would expire once ten large scale plants are built or commercial production reaches 100 000 barrels of CTL fuel daily  Planning Loans   Provides DOE authority to issue matching loans to groups engaging permitting and planning of a large scale CTL plant   The loans are capped at  20 million  must be matched dollar for dollar by non Federal money  and must be repaid after the plant is financed  within 5 years   Expanded Plant Siting   Authorizes DOE  DOD  and other agencies to promulgate regulations to allow BRAC sites  military bases and DOE current and former facilities to be considered as sites for commercial CTL plants   2  Tax Incentives for Investment and Production Investment Tax Credit and Expensing   Expands 20  tax credit for CTL plants  including the infrastructure needed to capture  transport and sequester carbon  capped at  200 million a plant and limited to 10 plants  Provides a similar provision for expensing these investments  but does not allow double dipping  Fuel Excise Tax Extension for CTL   Extends the fuel tax credit for CTL products from 2009  From SAFETEA LU  until January 1  2020   3  National Security and Defense Strategic Petroleum Reserve   Requires a DOD report on CTL fuel storage and inclusion in the SPR  authorizes the construction of SPR storage facilities for CTL fuel to be located outside of the Gulf States and authorizes that the SPR to hold up to 20  of the reserve in the form of CTL finished fuels   DOD Research and Development   Authorizes funding for the Air Force CTL R and testing program  DOD Multi year contracting   Authorizes DOD contract authority for up to 25 years
