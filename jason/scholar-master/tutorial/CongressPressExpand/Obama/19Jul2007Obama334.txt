                  Obama Introduces Bill to Halt  Review Military Personality Disorder Discharges Thursday  July 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Would institute moratorium to ensure service members are receiving VA benefits they are owed WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation to temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges after receiving broad  bipartisan support for an identical amendment he proposed to the Defense Authorization bill   The bill would institute a moratorium on discharge procedures until they are thoroughly reviewed and an independent review board is established  Senators Bond  D MO   Boxer  D CA   Lieberman  I CT   McCaskill  D MO    Murray  D WA   Durbin  D IL   Johnson  D SD   Sanders  I VT   and Whitehouse joined as co sponsors      With thousands of American service members suffering from service connected psychological injuries  reports of the Department of Defense improperly diagnosing service members with personality disorders are troubling  especially when the VA benefits owed to our service members are at stake     said Senator Obama      This legislation will force the Department of Defense to suspend its use of this discharge procedure until Secretary Gates can conduct a comprehensive review of these policies and establish a review board to evaluate questionable cases   It is our moral obligation to ensure that all of our returning service members receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve   Meeting this obligation is one thing we can still get right about this war     Recent reports suggest that in some cases the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately and inconsistently used these procedures to discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs   Those discharges can result in the loss of healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt   Senator Obama originally offered this bipartisan legislation as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill   And on June 21  2007  Obama joined Senator Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  McCaskill  Murray  and twenty five other Democratic and Republican senators who wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly  Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time   Army studies have found that up to 30 percent of soldiers coming home from Iraq have suffered from depression  anxiety or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  A recent study found that those who have served multiple tours are 50 percent more likely to suffer from acute combat stress   The military has discharged more than 22 500 service members with for a  pre existing  personality disorder over the past six years   There are indications that some of these brave warriors may instead be suffering from combat related injuries like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injuries   Last week  an ABC Nightline investigation reported on Army Specialist Jonathan Town   In 2004  a 107 mm rocket ripped through his unit   s headquarters in Ramadi  exploding two feet about Jonathan   s head and knocking him unconscious   The blast left him with hearing loss  headaches  memory problems  anxiety and insomnia   Instead of treating Jonathan Town for PTSD  the Army discharged him  claiming he had a personality disorder that existed before he entered the military   His discharge not only resulted in the loss of his VA benefits  but the DOD sent him a bill seeking repayment of his  3 000 enlistment bonus   In short  Army Specialist Jonathan Town went off to war to fight for his country     and the government billed him for it   During the course of its investigation  Nightline investigators spoke with 20 veterans who served in Iraq who believe they were misdiagnosed with personality disorders     possibly as a way to avoid paying them disability benefits   This legislation mandates a temporary moratorium on personality disorder discharges until the Department of Defense conducts a proper review and revision of its current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis  It also gives the DOD flexibility by granting an exception to the moratorium in those cases in which a service member provides false or misleading information  or omits information about past criminal behavior during the recruitment or enlistment process  The moratorium would be lifted after the DOD reviews its current policies  ensures it is following standard clinical diagnostic practices  and has established an independent review board to ensure that service members who have received this diagnosis may seek a review   Obama serves as a member of the Veterans  Affairs
