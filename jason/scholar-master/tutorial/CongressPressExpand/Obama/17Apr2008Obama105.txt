properly secured WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama sent the following letter to Assistant Secretary Kip Hawley at the Transportation Security Administration  TSA   calling on him to address recent reports of possible security vulnerabilities at O Hare International Airport in Chicago   Earlier this week  reports surfaced suggesting that TSA uniforms and security information were not properly secured within the airport facilities   Because terrorists have attempted to impersonate law enforcement and other security officials in order to gather intelligence  conduct counter surveillance  and even carry out attacks  it is critical these uniforms and this information are secured      In the letter  Obama calls on TSA to provide the written guidelines  policies  and procedures in place governing the security of uniforms  portable equipment  and other supplies at all airports where TSA has screening operations  provide information on how internal affairs teams test for compliance with these policies  submit information on whether intelligence staff is concerned about theft of screener uniforms or other items as a terrorist tactic  and confirm whether TSA will perform an investigation of these recent events  The text of the letter is below  Dear Assistant Secretary Hawley  I write to express my serious concerns about recent reports concerning possible shortcomings in how the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  secures screeners  uniforms at O Hare International Airport in Chicago  As you know  terrorists have attempted to impersonate law enforcement and other security officials in order to gather intelligence  conduct counter surveillance  and even carry out attacks   Considering the extraordinary security threats our nation faces every day  reports suggesting that uniforms could possibly be accessed are wholly unacceptable   Given your agency s public comments on these recent events at O Hare  I request that you provide further information to highlight areas where improvements may be urgently needed  Can you provide me with the written guidelines  policies  and procedures in place governing the security of uniforms  portable equipment  e g   hand wands  training items  etc    and other supplies at all airports where TSA has screening operations   Can you confirm that these rules apply equally to airports where screeners are employed by private contractors  Can you provide information on how your internal affairs teams test for compliance with these policies   If this information is classified or otherwise restricted  my staff will arrange to receive a briefing with appropriate safeguards in place  Can you provide information on whether your intelligence staff  or the intelligence staff of the Department of Homeland Security or any agency  is concerned about theft of screener uniforms or other items as a terrorist tactic   As with the item above  we can arrange to receive this information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity  Can you confirm whether TSA will in fact perform an investigation of recent events at O Hare  despite some press reports to the contrary   If you will not conduct an investigation  can you articulate why this decision was made   Similarly  if an investigation is to be conducted  can you describe its scope and purpose  As a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  I am committed to doing everything I can to help protect the homeland   My concerns about on site security are not limited to screener uniforms  but extend to other threat items  e g   fake guns  bomb parts  etc    training materials  and other items that are not visible to the traveling public and which  if breached  could provide very useful information to those who wish to do us harm  I know that the more than 40 000 TSA screeners work diligently to screen millions of passengers and bags every day across America  but their efforts will be compromised if seemingly mundane  but still critical security protocols are not followed   Any reassurances you can provide will be very helpful   Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter
