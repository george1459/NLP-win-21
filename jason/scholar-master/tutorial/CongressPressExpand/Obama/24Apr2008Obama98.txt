   Obama Joins Kerry to Push for Senate Investigation of Tax Shelter Abuses   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Obama Joins Kerry to Push for Senate Investigation of Tax Shelter Abuses Thursday  April 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 24  2008  CONTACT  Liz Richardson  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama     WASHINGTON  DC   Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  Sen  Carl Levin and Norm Coleman respectively  Kerry and Obama asked that their colleagues consider investigating government contractors that circumvent paying payroll taxes by hiring employees through offshore shell companies  Last month  Kerry and Obama introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 to close this tax loophole and save the American taxpayer an estimated  846 million over ten years  In the House  the bill is being sponsored by Reps  Brad Ellsworth and Rahm Emanuel  and was recently included in the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008      Abusing offshore tax loopholes is wrong and at least one greedy company has fleeced the American taxpayer to the tune of hundreds of millions since the Iraq war began   said Senator Kerry   The American people who play by the rules and foot the bill for this war in Iraq deserve to know just how many companies are avoiding paying their fair share of taxes and how much it s costing our economy  The Senate has a responsibility to shed some sunlight on the tax practices of these government contractors  and we will not be satisfied until these kinds of loopholes are eliminated once and for all      It s the responsibility of American companies to pay their taxes and ensure that their employees  work is counted for future Social Security and Medicare benefits   said Senator Obama   It s unacceptable for contractors to use foreign shell companies to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes  and that s why Senator Kerry and I introduced legislation to close this loophole and hold these contractors accountable   I look forward to moving this legislation forward and working to crack down on tax havens and abusive tax shelters     Please find the text of Senator Kerry and Obama s letter below  April 23  2008 The Honorable Carl Levin    Chairman   Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations   Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs    199 Russell Senate Office Building      The Honorable Norm Coleman  Ranking Member  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs    199 Russell Senate Office Building      Dear Senators Levin and Coleman  Recently  we introduced S  2775  the Fair Share Act of 2008  which ends the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Representatives Ellsworth and Emanuel also introduced companion legislation  This legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes  The legislation was introduced in response to a Boston Globe article in which Farah Stockman reported that Kellogg Brown   Root  KBR  has avoided payroll taxes by hiring workers through shell companies in the Cayman Islands   American companies who are benefiting from U S  government contracts are able to set up foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and treat American workers employed in connection with the contract as employees of the subsidiary   As a result  those employers can avoid Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and their employees are denied the contributions for Federal benefits purposes  We bring this issue to your attention because we think it is another example of the abuse of offshore tax havens used in order to avoid the payment of U S  taxes   We believe closing this glaring loophole is consistent with your efforts to address tax shelters and tax havens   It is unclear how pervasive the practice used by KBR is  but there are numerous federal contractors that have subsidiaries located in tax havens and  as your investigations have uncovered  an abundance of tax professionals willing to help companies shirk their tax responsibilities whenever a loophole can be found      We are working with the Finance Committee to close this tax loophole  and the House recently included this legislation as part of the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that closing this loophole raises  846 million over ten years    We request that the Permanent Subcommittees on Investigations investigate this and similar abuses by federal contractors to avoid payroll taxes  and we look forward to continuing to work with you on measures to ensure fairness for American taxpayers    Sincerely   JOHN F  KERRY                                                         US Senator   BARACK OBAMA  US Senator
