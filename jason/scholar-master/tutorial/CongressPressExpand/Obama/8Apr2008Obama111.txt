   Obama Statement on Efforts to Assist Former Blockson Chemical Plant Workers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Statement on Efforts to Assist Former Blockson Chemical Plant Workers Tuesday  April  8  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT   Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following update on his efforts to ensure that the workers from the former Blockson Chemical plant in Braidwood  Illinois are informed about claims they have filed with the U S  Department of Labor under the federal Energy Employees Occupational Illness and Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA   The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  ABRWH   which by law reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services  and is appointed by the President  is holding a meeting April 7 9 in Tampa  Florida   While the Advisory Board will discuss issues related to several former nuclear weapons sites around the country  one of the items on their agenda is the Blockson Chemical Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  petition     After these Blockson Chemical plant workers and their families have already suffered through so much  we owe it them make sure the government takes a second look at all of the claims that were denied   said Senator Obama    I call on the Advisory Board to approve the petition  and ensure that everyone is compensated   But  if the petition is not granted  I am pleased to know these denied claims will at least be reopened and recalculated    I am committed to these Illinoisans  claims  and will do everything I can to keep their chances of compensation alive    The EEOICPA  which was enacted in 2000  is designed to provide compensation to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who worked on the U S  government s nuclear weapons development program during the Cold War   Many of these workers were often exposed to harmful radiation  without their knowledge  and now suffer from cancer and other debilitating illnesses   The U S  Department of Labor administers the EEOICPA program  while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH   a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  administers the dose reconstruction aspect of the program   The EEOICPA law provides two ways for workers or their survivors to be compensated  individually or as part of a larger group   For individuals  through a process called  dose reconstruction   NIOSH estimates the exposure workers were subjected to using mathematical models based on available data  such as contracts  purchase orders  safety monitoring records and worker medical records   However  if workers believe the government cannot accurately perform the dose reconstructions  a petitioner can file a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  petition on behalf of a group of workers   This petition is filed with NIOSH   Once NIOSH completes an evaluation of a petition  NIOSH presents its report to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  ABRWH    If the Advisory Board  which currently has twelve members  determines that the government cannot accurately complete dose reconstructions  then by majority vote the Board will send a report with its recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services   If the Advisory Board sides with the government s argument that dose reconstructions can be performed with sufficient accuracy  the Board will vote to recommend denial of the SEC petition   On its own initiative  NIOSH can advise  and in the past has advised  the Advisory Board that it could not perform dose reconstructions and thus has recommended that a class of claimants be compensated via an SEC   The Secretary of Health and Human Services makes the ultimate determination as to whether a petition should be approved or denied  In the case of Blockson Chemical  an SEC petition has been submitted   The Advisory Board met in 2006 in Naperville  IL  where Senator Obama addressed the Board and advocated on behalf of workers at several Illinois nuclear weapons sites  including Blockson Chemical   At that time  Senator Obama pressed the government to hold worker outreach meetings with Blockson workers to hear first hand accounts of what transpired at Blockson  to seek the counsel of an outside auditor as to the accuracy of the dose reconstructions being performed on Blockson claims  and to delay voting by the Advisory Board until the Board s independent auditor could perform a full review    NIOSH has contended that there is sufficient information to conduct a dose reconstruction by calculating the radiation that the Blockson employees were exposed to based on radiation that workers at an unrelated factory were exposed to and on urinalysis data from some  but not all  Blockson workers   I confess I m not a radiation expert   There are some around this table who are   But it does strike me that this is a somewhat suspect way at arriving at whether Blockson workers were sufficiently exposed to deserve compensation   It also seems to me to be contrary to the intent of the original legislation governing this compensation program  and I d strongly urge the Board to review this policy   I m also concerned that no official worker outreach meeting was conducted with the Blockson workers   Seems to me that if you re going to do a dose reconstruction  you d want to talk to all the workers  find out what evidence they have  and give them all a chance to comment on the procedure you re going to follow   So as a consequence I would urge the Board to postpone its decision regarding the Blockson SEC petition until after the Board s independent auditor has had a chance to review NIOSH s arguments    Comments delivered by Senator Obama to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  December 12  2006  Naperville  IL  All of Senator Obama s requests were agreed to by the Board and NIOSH  At present  the Blockson claimant who filed the SEC petition has defined the SEC class as  All Atomic Weapons Employers employees  contractors and subcontractors  who worked in Building 55 at the Blockson Chemical Company  also known as Olin Mathieson  from January 1  1951 to December 31  1962    However  after discussions between NIOSH and the Department of Labor  the following class definition was offered and used by NIOSH in its evaluation   All Atomic Weapons Employers personnel who worked on activities related to the production of uranium at Blockson Chemical Company  Joliet  IL from January 1  1951 to December 31  1962   In terms of compensation  whether it is through the individual dose reconstruction process or via an SEC petition  workers who are approved for payment receive  150 000 plus medical benefits   It is important to stress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services decides who will  or will not  be in any class which receives compensation  although the Advisory Board s recommendation is an important part of his decision   With respect to the SEC petition  the Advisory Board has several options   It can   1  approve the petition according to the petitioner s definition  2  approve the petition according to the governments proposed definition  3  approve the petition with a new definition  drafted by the Board  4  deny the petition in its entirety  or 5  delay voting on the petition to a subsequent meeting   Following next week s meeting in Tampa  the next Advisory Board meeting will be held in June in St  Louis   The date and location are undetermined   To date  based on radiation dose reconstructions completed by NIOSH  the Department of Labor has approved 20 Blockson claims for payment and 91 claims have been denied  However  at Senator Obama s request  in late 2006 the Advisory Board sought and received a review by the Advisory Board s independent auditor  Sanford Cohen   Associates  as to the technical approach used by NIOSH to calculate Blockson dose reconstructions   After a thorough review  Sanford Cohen   Associates recommended seven changes to the dose reconstruction process   As a result  if the Advisory Board does not approve the Blockson SEC  NIOSH will automatically re calculate the 91 dose reconstructions previously denied in order to include these new recommendations   Any claimant who has already received compensation would not have his or her dose reconstruction re calculated and the compensation decision would stand   Senator Obama s staffer  who handles nuclear weapons worker compensation issues  will be in Tampa  Florida to monitor the Board s deliberations and speak on the workers  behalf
