                                           Obama  Harkin Introduce Low Carbon Fuel Standard that Would Reduce Emissions  Dependence on Foreign Oil Monday  May  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  or Kate Cyrul  Harkin    Legislation would expand the renewable fuels market to reduce carbon emissions WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation establishing a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard that would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions in the short and long term   The bill requires a reduction of about 180 million metric tons in emissions in 2020     the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road   The Obama Harkin fuel standard embraces the growth of the renewable fuels market  including corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  and biodiesel as a key component of fighting climate change  while incentivizing lower carbon emissions in their production         Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles is one of the most aggressive and immediate steps we can take to fight climate change     said Senator Obama      Expanding the renewable fuels market in the United States will reduce our dependence on foreign oil  revitalize our agricultural sector  and provide a sustainable means to combat global warming   A homegrown solution to the international climate crisis lies in America   s fields and farms             It   s time to act on climate change     said Senator Harkin  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee      We   ve got to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and emissions from our vehicles need to be a part of that   This bill sets a standard that establishes a steady downward trend for life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of our transportation fuels   Because biofuels generally have lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions  this bill also promotes rural economic development and national energy security         The U S  relies on imports for 60  of the petroleum it consumes  and the oil used in the U S  transportation sector accounts for one third of our nation   s emissions of greenhouse gases   Senators Obama and Harkin have introduced a bill establishing a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard  NLCFS  that will reduce both our dependence on foreign oil and our greenhouse gas emissions   The National Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2007 will   Provide near term demand certainty to renewable fuel producers  The Renewable Fuel Standard in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will be expanded in the near term to require 15 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012  Expand the market for low carbon fuels over the long term  The NLCFS requires fuel refiners that produce petroleum based fuels to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation fuels sold in the U S  by 5 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2020   Because most biofuels have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline  the NLCFS will greatly expand the market for renewable fuels such as corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  and biodiesel while incentivizing lower carbon emissions in their production  By one estimate  the NLCFS will create a market for over 40 billion gallons of biofuels by 2020  Drive the production of ultra low carbon fuels   The bill requires fuel refiners to use minimum amounts of fuels with 50 and 75 percent lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline  This requirement signals to investors that there will be a market for advanced fuels  but still allows significant leeway for fuel refiners to choose the optimal mix of fuels to meet their overall greenhouse gas emissions targets  Utilize a credit trading mechanism  Fuel refiners can trade allowances or bank them against future carbon reduction requirements   Ensure an environmentally sustainable biofuels expansion  The bill ensures that the expansion of biofuels production does not impact national wildlife refuges  national parks  national forests  old growth forests  or national grasslands  The bill calls for an assessment of the impacts of the expansion  including a comparison to the business as usual scenario of continued reliance on petroleum based transportation fuels  and the development of standards by 2012 to protect air  land  and water quality  Achieve a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  According to one estimate  the NLCFS would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 million metric tons in 2020   This is the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road in 2020   If enacted in conjunction with a bill  S  768  proposed by Senator Obama to raise fuel efficiency standards  the NLCFS would reduce emissions by about 530 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2020  the equivalent of taking over 50 million cars off the road  Achieve a major reduction in oil imports  By making greater use of home grown  renewable fuels  the NLCFS could reduce the annual consumption of gasoline derived from foreign oil imports by about 30 billion gallons in 2020
