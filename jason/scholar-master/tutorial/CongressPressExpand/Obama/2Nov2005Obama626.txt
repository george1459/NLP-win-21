   Obama Praises Court Decision to Block Georgia Law Requiring Photo ID to Vote   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Praises Court Decision to Block Georgia Law Requiring Photo ID to Vote Wednesday  October 19  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  October 19  2005  Obama Praises Court Decision to Block Georgia Law Requiring Photo ID to Vote   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today praised a U S  District Court decision to block enforcement of a Georgia law requiring residents to show a photo ID before voting  The opinion  issued yesterday  concludes that this state law likely violates the 24th Amendment by imposing requirements for voting that disproportionately affect Georgia s elderly  low income and minority voters     Georgia s photo ID requirement is nothing more than a modern day poll tax   said Obama   It sets conditions for voting that potentially disenfranchise a large pool of voters  generally the poorest among us  who may not have the access to transportation or the resources necessary to travel great distances and pay up to  35 to acquire the photo ID that allows them to exercise their fundamental right to be heard   Yesterday s court decision was the right one and is an important victory in the fight to ensure that all Americans are treated equally at the polls          At least 150 000 senior citizens in Georgia do not have government issued photo identification  Currently  Georgia has only 56 locations in its 159 counties where people can get this photo identification   and Atlanta  one of America s largest cities  is not one of them  The ID s would cost up to  35  which the court ruled would constitute a poll tax    Last month  Senator Obama introduced a joint resolution with Georgia Congressman John Lewis  D GA  and Senator Chris Dodd  D CT  expressing their belief that any law requiring a photo ID to vote would put an undue burden on voters  The resolution was in response to the Department of Justice s clearance of the Georgia statute and the Carter Baker Commission on Election Reform s recommendation of a national ID requirement     Proponents of a mandatory photo ID say their goal is to protect the integrity of the ballot   said Obama   Yet  they provide no evidence to document that voters appearing at the polls claiming to be someone they are not is actually a problem  In our democracy  the goal should be to encourage eligible voters to vote  not to create new barriers to make it more difficult for them to exercise their most basic right     Obama s resolution currently has 23 cosponsors
