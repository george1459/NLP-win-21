   Senator Obama s Office Responds to Misleading Harper s Magazine Story   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senator Obama s Office Responds to Misleading Harper s Magazine Story Monday  October 23  2006   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor  202  997 3462  The latest issue of Harper s Magazine contains a piece titled  BARACK OBAMA INC  The birth of a Washington machine   The story is unfortunately filled with a selective presentation of the facts  innuendo and a cynical assumption of bad faith in our leaders  While we do not doubt the integrity or the intelligence of the piece s author  Ken Silverstein  we feel that our side of the story was not fairly presented  Below are some misleading passages from the piece  and some facts we believe will help tell the full story  Misleading Claim  1  Iraq Harper s Magazine says Obama has changed his rhetoric on Iraq  Silverstein wrote   The calibration of Obama s own political rhetoric has been particularly evident in regard to the war in Iraq   Since taking office  Obama has become far more measured in his position    page 38  Fact  Obama has been consistent   He opposed the war from the start  but decided that once we were in Iraq  we needed to plan our withdrawal carefully  Frank Rich of the New York Times puts it succinctly    On one true test for his party  Iraq   Obama  was consistent from the start  On the long trail to a hotly competitive senatorial primary in Illinois  he repeatedly questioned the rationale for the war before it began         He judged Saddam to pose no immediate threat to America and argued for containment over a war         He hasn t changed  In his new book  he gives a specific date  the end of this year  for beginning   a phased withdrawal of U S  troops           New York Times 10 23 2006     Misleading Claim  2    Favors to the Nuclear Industry Harper s Magazine implies that Obama voted to protect loan guarantees for energy technology on behalf of the nuclear industry   page 37   Fact  Obama voted with 75 other Senators to promote a wide array of innovative energy technologies  The Sununu amendment in question would have eliminated loan guarantees to encourage emerging clean energy technologies  These guarantees encouraged a wide array of renewable fuel   Besides nuclear energy  the guarantees can be used for solar and wind power  hybrid cars  hydrogen fuel cells  carbon sequestration  coal gasification and other technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Obama voted against the Sununu amendment because he supports emerging technologies and believes many companies would not pursue advanced research without financial support   In the end  76 senators opposed the amendment    Misleading Claim  3  Support for Other Democrats Harper s Magazine says Obama only gives funds to moderate  establishment Democrats  failing to note that Obama has donated to every Senate Democrat running for office in 2006  Harper s says  Obama s PAC has given to candidates that have been carefully culled and selected by the Democratic establishment on the basis of their marketability as palatable  moderates  even when they are facing more progressive and equally viable challengers   Harper s cites as examples Obama s political donations to Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont  and Tammy Duckworth over Christine Cegelis   page 37  Fact  Obama donated to every Democratic Senator running for reelection and then contributed to Ned Lamont after he won the primary  Harper s takes exception to Obama s decision to donate money to Senator Lieberman  but fails to note that Obama endorsed Ned Lamont and gave him  5 000 the day after Lamont won the nomination   Obama also donated money to every Senate Democrat up for reelection and to every Democratic challenger in a closely contested Senate race  including Sherrod Brown  Claire McCaskill  Sheldon Whitehouse  and Amy Klobuchar  Harper s Magazine misrepresents Tammy Duckworth s position on Iraq  Harper s also implies that Duckworth is a pro war candidate  noting  When asked about her stand on the Iraq war by a reporter  Duckworth had replied   There is good and bad in everything     page 37 38  Duckworth  an Iraq war veteran  says on her website      Misleading Claim  4  Ethanol Harper s Magazine implies that Obama has supported ethanol production because the country s largest ethanol producer  ADM is based in Illinois  Harper s also argues that from a conservation standpoint it is potentially better to drive a standard gasoline car than a flex fuel vehicle   page 32   Fact  Senator Obama supports ethanol production because it is a clean  efficient  and domestically produced alternative to oil from the Middle East  According to the Environmental Protection Agency  E85 fuel produces fewer total toxins and lower levels of ozone forming volatile organic compounds compared to gasoline  The U S  Department of Agriculture has determined that ethanol production is efficient  creating 1 67 times the energy it takes to produce it   Argonne National Laboratory reports that by switching to ethanol and biomass fuels in our passenger cars and light duty trucks  drivers can potentially reduce the use of petroleum by at least 68 percent   Blending ethanol with gasoline just at a 10 percent level will translate to savings to consumers of  3 3 billion a year according to independent researchers at LECG  based on 2002 prices    Sources           Senator Obama wants to enable more entrepreneurs and small businesses to develop ethanol  Senator Obama supports a renewable fuels standard that would encourage ethanol production by expanding demand for renewable fuels and further diversifying the ethanol industry  thereby ensuring much greater competition in the U S  liquid fuels market in the future   Misleading Claim  5  Democratic Convention Speech Harper s Magazine suggests that Senator Obama was chosen to speak at the Democratic National Convention only after he had received the blessing of Washington lobbyists and fundraisers   If the speech was his debut to the wider American public  he had already undergone an equally successful but much quieter audition with Democratic Party leaders and fund raisers  without whose support he would surely never have had been chosen for such a prominent role at the convention    page 36  Fact  The decision to choose Senator Obama was made by Senator John Kerry s campaign  not by lobbyists  After Obama s selection as the keynote speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention  Senator Kerry s aides were very clear about their rationale  According to the Chicago Tribune   For the Kerry campaign  the choice of Obama has great meaning as officials try to dispel criticism that they have done a poor job of reaching out to African American voters  Kerry began to focus on Obama  the Democratic candidate for Senate in Illinois  for a role at the convention after meeting him for the first time and listening to him speak at a gala fundraiser in Chicago in April  The next day  Kerry and Obama toured the Greater West Town Community Development Project  visited a bakery  and held a town hall meeting together  An aide to Kerry said the Massachusetts senator was struck by Obama s  passion  eloquence and charisma    Chicago Tribune  July 15  2004   Misleading Claim  6  Private Jets Harper s Magazine wrongly says that Obama stopped taking privately subsidized air travel because of bad press    A fter some atypically bad press for accepting flight  Obama imposed a ban at his office on privately subsidized travel    page 40  footnote  Fact  Obama voluntarily chose to reimburse the full fare for private flights   not just the first class fare as Senate rules require   because he felt it was right  Obama voluntarily chose to reimburse full fare on private flights despite less stringent Senate rules because he thought it was the right thing to do   Obama s decision actually garnered Obama favorable press coverage   Senator Barack Obama flew at least nine times on corporate jets last year   each time  he reimbursed the plane s owners at first class rates  as Senate rules require  But Mr  Obama  freshman Democrat from Illinois  felt queasy about this perk of Senate life  so he said he gave it up   This is an example where appearances matter   he said    New York Times  March 8  2006   Misleading Claim  7  Organized Labor Harper s Magazine suggests that Obama s hiring of a former staffer for Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin makes him susceptible to policies that hurt organized labor  Harper s writes    Obama  hired Karen Kornbluh  a senior aide to Robert Rubin when the latter  as head of the Treasury Department under Bill Clinton  was a chief advocate for NAFTA and other free trade policies that decimated the nation s manufacturing sector    page 33  Fact  Obama has a strong pro labor voting record   Obama voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement and has said that NAFTA should be renegotiated   Obama has cosponsored many important bills to help workers  including  an increase in the minimum wage  and the Employee Free Choice Act   He also championed efforts in the Senate to help air traffic controllers engaged in a labor dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration   Misleading Claim  8  Calling to Action Harper s Magazine criticizes Obama for calling on students only to strive for energy independence during a speech in July   Obama s speech contained just a single call for political action  This was when he had introduced Mark Pike  a law student who then came bounding across the state in a green one piece mechanic s outfit  As part of a campaign called  Kick the Oil Habit   Pike was to depart directly from the conference and drive from Washington to Los Angeles in a  flex fuel  vehicle   Give it up for Mark   Obama had urged the crowd  noting that Pike would be refueling only at gas stations that offer E85 which Obama touts as  a clean  renewable  and domestically produced alternative fuel     page 32  Fact  Obama was specifically asked to touch on only two themes in his speech  The group that organized the event   the Center for American Progress   specifically asked Obama to touch on two themes in his speech  1  what inspired him to go into politics  and 2  briefly the importance of energy independence    If Harper s was interested in hearing about other issues  below are speeches by Senator Obama on a range of subjects  which are all available on his U S  Senate website           Energy Security is National Security   Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet  Teaching Our Kids in a 21st Century Economy
