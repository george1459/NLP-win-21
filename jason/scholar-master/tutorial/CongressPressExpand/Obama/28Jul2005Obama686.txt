   Obama Amendment Would Help Prevent Lead Poisoning in Children   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Amendment Would Help Prevent Lead Poisoning in Children Wednesday  June 29  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  June 29  2005 OBAMA AMENDMENT WOULD HELP PREVENT LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN WASHINGTON   The Senate approved an amendment by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Tuesday to the Interior Appropriations bill that would help speed the creation of regulations to protect our nation s children from dangerous lead paint poisoning  Renovation and repair of older residences is the principal source of lead paint exposure to U S  children  According to federal studies  a large majority of the approximately 20 30 million renovations done on older homes each year are done without lead safe cleanup and contamination practices   In 1992  Congress required the EPA to write regulations relating to the dispersal of lead paint by contractors during home remodeling by October  1996  As of June 2005  these regulations still have not been written  Senator Obama s amendment would stop the EPA from spending money on actions that are contrary to Congress  mandate  including delaying the creation of these needed regulations   In 1992  we made a promise to our nation s children that we would protect them from dangerous lead paint poisoning   said Obama   But sadly  the EPA has dragged its feet on setting common sense national standards that would prevent an estimated 28 000 lead related illnesses per year  This legislation is of particular importance to Illinois  which reports the highest number of lead poisoned children in the nation  Each day that this problem persists is another day that our children s health is compromised   Over 430 000 children in America have dangerously high levels of lead in their blood  Jeff Ruch  Executive Director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility  said Obama s amendment will spur the EPA to create these regulations   Senator Obama s action puts EPA on notice that it may no longer delay addressing a tragic but completely avoidable public health threat   Ruch said   EPA has shirked its commitment to achieve the national goal of eliminating childhood lead poisoning by 2010  We believe that  by this action  Congress spurs EPA to effectively address lead dust created by renovation and remodeling in older housing  as Congress mandated EPA to have completed in 1996  According to EPA s own estimates  1 4 million children under age 7 residing in some 4 9 million households are at risk of lead exposure due to unsafe repair and renovations  The renovation regulations could be expected to prevent at least 28 000 lead related illnesses each year  thereby preventing  1 6 billion in medical costs and economic losses annually   EPA also found that the regulations that it is delaying would create an annual net economic benefit of more than  2 7 billion  Intervention by Congress is sorely needed   Jane Malone  Housing Policy Director of the Alliance for Healthy Homes  said she hoped Obama s legislation will prompt the EPA write these much needed regulations   Childhood lead poisoning is a completely preventable disease   said Malone   EPA s rule to prevent lead based paint hazards during renovation and remodeling is long overdue  Within the statute  there are policy alternatives to making every painter in the US get an abatement license  A national ban on unsafe work practices and widespread access to training in working using lead safe work practices would keep Congress  13 year old promise to protect children from being poisoned by lead based paint hazards created by home renovation and remodeling projects  We hope that this amendment will prompt EPA to actually promulgate this much needed policy
