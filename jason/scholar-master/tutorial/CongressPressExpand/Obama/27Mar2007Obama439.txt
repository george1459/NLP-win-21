   Obama  McCaskill Initiative Would Improve Treatment for Servicemembers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Initiative Would Improve Treatment for Servicemembers Tuesday  March 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Amendment would ensure soldiers are cared for after they return home from war WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  were today joined by Senators Kerry  D MA   Cantwell  D WA   Biden  D DE   Harkin  D IA   Mikulski  D MD   and Bingaman  D NM  in introducing an amendment to the Iraq supplemental bill that would improve care for servicemembers at active duty military hospitals by adding caseworkers and mental health counselors  reducing bureaucratic hurdles  establishing a women   s mental health treatment program and providing a comprehensive mental health study to ensure that the needs of returning soldiers are met   The amendment is based on S  713  the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  which Obama and McCaskill in February  Key provisions of the amendment are  More Caseworkers     The Post series found that servicemembers waited on average 209 days to get their disability paperwork processed because caseworkers were overwhelmed by the large number of patients   During this period of limbo  servicemembers have no idea whether they   re going to remain on active duty  whether they   re going to be discharged and  if so  how much they will receive in benefits   In order to speed up the processing of paperwork  the amendment provides  41 million to hire 10 additional caseworkers at each of the 75 military hospitals  More Mental Health and Crisis Counselors     The Post series found that many servicemembers had insufficient access to counselors to help them with psychological problems resulting from their combat service and injuries   Nor did families of servicemembers have access to counselors to help them cope with the challenges and stresses they would face   The amendment provides  17 million to hire 4 additional caseworkers at each of the 75 military hospitals   Electronic Submission of Paperwork     Recovering servicemembers are forced to navigate a confusing DOD bureaucracy that requires them to submit numerous documents to different offices  which often lose the documents   To address this problem  the amendment provides  30 million for the Armed Forces to develop a new secure system to allow recovering servicemembers to submit required paperwork on the Internet and to allow the Armed Forces to track and review paperwork on the Internet  Women   s Mental Health Treatment Program     A recent New York Times Magazine story found that women soldiers face particular mental health issues  particularly given the high number of women soldiers who are the victims of sexual assault and harassment   The amendment provides  15 million for DOD to develop a women s mental health treatment program  including the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors  to assist female servicemembers who have experienced post traumatic stress disorder or sexual assault and abuse   Comprehensive Study of Mental Health Needs     Following the Vietnam War  a comprehensive study of the mental health needs of returning soldiers was not conducted until 1983     15 years after the height of the war   That is too late   This amendment requires the National Academy of Sciences to study the mental health needs of returning Iraq and Afghanistan servicemembers based on the landmark 1983 National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study   Senator Obama   s remarks on the amendment are below  Towards the end of World War II  Norman Rockwell created a cover for the Saturday Evening Post titled     Homecoming G I       It is a picture of a soldier returning from war   He has a duffle bag clutched in his left hand   He   s looking up at the back of a brick building with laundry hanging from the back porch   A woman in an apron sees him with outstretched arms and a young child races down the stairs   Everyone sees that soldier     the neighbor   s kids  the man fixing the roof  faces from another window     and everyone welcomes that soldier who   s come home from war   That is what our nation did for the millions of service members who returned from the Atlantic and the Pacific   We watched them come home in waves  some were just as strong as their first day in battle  others limped   We saw them crowd Times Square   We saw them walk down Main Streets and sit on stoops   And my grandfather  who fought in Patton   s army  would often speak about this time as America at its finest   That Homecoming didn   t just happen  we were ready for it   Long before the beaches of Normandy were stormed and the last battle was fought  in 1943  President Roosevelt said         Among many other things we are  today  laying plans for the return to civilian life of our gallant men and women in the armed services  They must not be demobilized into an environment of inflation and unemployment  to a place on a bread line  or on a corner selling apples  We must  this time  have plans ready     instead of waiting to do a hasty  inefficient  and ill considered job at the last moment      These are words of wisdom that we ignore at our peril   Today  we have more than 631 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the Global War on Terror   According to a recent VA health care report  one third   more than 205 000   have sought treatment at VA health facilities   Even if the war in Iraq comes to an end soon     and I hope the Senate takes action this week to accomplish that goal     the war will live on with our service members and their families for the rest of our lives   Unfortunately  over the past month  we have all seen the disturbing pictures of neglect at Walter Reed   We have read about bats and bureaucratic red tape at the VA   We have seen too many stories about our veterans who have been forgotten   not greeted by the nation that asked them to serve   The time has come for us to see this generation of veterans in all their valor and pain   We should provide them with a plan that is worthy of their courage and will help build back the military they love   That is what Senator McCaskill and I are trying to do with the amendment we offer today   First  we provide an additional  41 million to hire more caseworkers to assist service members navigating the military   s bureaucracy   The last thing a wounded service member should have to face when they return home is a frontline of paper work and delay   Right now  the caseworker to service member ratio at Walter Reed is 1 to 50   Caseworkers help recovering soldiers schedule appointments  care for their everyday needs  and help them fill out paperwork   Military caseworkers are overwhelmed   I understand that the Army is reducing the caseworker to service member ratio to 1 in 17   I applaud this move and our amendment would help the military achieve this goal at all military hospitals   Our amendment also provides  30 million for the armed forces to create an Internet based system for service members to submit their paperwork electronically   No longer will amputees and servicemembers in wheelchairs have to go to countless offices to fill out duplicative forms  only to learn that the forms have been lost in the government bureaucracy   We also need to do more to increase the number of mental health crisis counselors available to assist recovering service members and their families   Too many service members are returning home with unmet mental health needs     stresses that are often experienced by their family members   That   s why our amendment provides  17 million for more mental health crisis counselors   While we all praise how our country treated the service members returning from World War II  we must remember the lessons after Vietnam   The landmark National Vietnam Veterans    Readjustment Study was congressionally mandated in 1983  fifteen years after the height of that war   The completed report showed that the vast majority of Vietnam veterans had successfully acclimated to post war life   We can   t wait fifteen years to plan and prepare for the readjustment needs of the service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   The average age of a service member deployed since September 11th is 27   The average age of our Guard and Reservists is 33   Sixty percent of those deployed have family responsibilities     47 percent of those who have died have left families   160 000 women have been deployed  and ten percent of those women are single mothers   These men and women are going to face real challenges in readjusting to normal life   Our amendment would provide for a study by the National Academy of Sciences of the mental health and readjustment needs of returning service members   This study will assist the Department of Defense  VA  and Congress in planning for the long term needs of our veterans  Mr  President  last week  I met a woman at Walter Reed   She is one of the 160 000 women who have been deployed  and she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder   Most of us associate PTSD with men and combat   But many of the women in theater face first hand dangers in their combat support roles   Driving a truck in Baghdad is one of the most dangerous missions around     and that is a support role   Women are witnessing the horrors of improvised explosive devices and the horrors of losing fellow service members   And too many experience the trauma of sexual abuse   This young woman was very scared and she trembled as we spoke   I asked what we could do to help   She said that she could not handle group therapy sessions  she could only tolerate one on one sessions with counselors   Her experience is shared by many women   Treatment for women with PTSD  especially sexual abuse victims  is very different from treatment for men   That is why today  we want to provide  15 million to address the unique mental health needs of women   This funding will ensure the development and implementation of a women   s treatment program for mental health conditions  including PTSD   It will also include the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors  so that the service members who suffer from this trauma do not have to suffer in silence   We can do this for the woman I met at Walter Reed and the thousands who suffer like her   The total cost of our amendment is  103 million     less than one tenth of one percent the total cost of this bill   That   s the least we can do for our service members and their families
