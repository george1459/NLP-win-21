2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the continuing crisis in Darfur   All the proclamations  the  Never Again  speeches  and the efforts of many around the world have as yet failed to stop the five year long genocide in Darfur   The indiscriminate killing  raping and displacement continue and are escalating  Only decisive and concerted action can end this genocide    To start  the US must lead in supporting the full and effective deployment of the United Nations  UN  African Union  AU  protection force and ensure that the Government of Sudan faces meaningful penalties for obstructing and delaying the deployment of this force   Ambassador Williamson should be commended for his efforts to support the rapid deployment of the African Union United Nations operations in Darfur  UNAMID  peacekeepers   But the Administration  led by President Bush and Secretary Rice  must do more to ensure the UN has the necessary equipment    especially helicopter support    to ensure the full mobility and effectiveness of UNAMID troops  The US should also press for the unrestricted deployment of United Nations Mission in Sudan  UNMIS  forces in South Sudan to Abyei to help prevent the resumption of fighting in that fragile region where tensions are rising   I am deeply concerned by recent reports that the Bush Administration is negotiating the normalization of relations and lifting of sanctions against the Government of Sudan in exchange for piecemeal and modest action on a narrow set of issues   The approach contradicts the resolute and clear policy required to improve conditions on the ground for those at risk  Khartoum has a long history of breaking its commitments to its own people and to the international community   There should be no reward for bad faith   The US relationship with the Government of Sudan can only improve once conditions for the Sudanese people improve   I hope that this hearing will provide a clear explanation of how the Administration s current strategy adheres to this common sense principle     Those that continue to commit war crimes and obstruct peace and protection efforts must face significant penalties  The US should lead in the UN Security Council to impose effective targeted sanctions and to curtail violations of the arms embargo through the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee and the US Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control   At the same time  the Administration should urge the AU to rebuke Khartoum for its role in the attempted coup in Chad  The US also needs to work with the International Criminal Court to ramp up the pace of indictments of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity  while Khartoum must feel increased pressure to hand over those individuals already indicted by the Court    Lasting peace in Darfur and South Sudan can only be achieved through the unflagging commitment and cooperation of our government  other interested governments around the world  the UN  the AU  the Arab League  and the EU  among others  and advocacy groups  A more comprehensive  consistent  and robust diplomatic effort is an important part of the way forward   US leadership is urgently needed both to help construct a credible peace process for Darfur and to ensure the full and fair implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  The US must work to ensure that a single mediator  actively supported by countries with significant leverage  emerges from the confusion that has characterized the Darfur peace process to date  Prime Minister Gordon Brown s offer to kick start the process is helpful and should be explored   At the same time  Special Envoy Williamson should have sufficient staff and support to devote sustained attention to both the genocide in Darfur and the fraying North South peace process   I am heartened that citizen pressure and activism all over the US is having an impact  Divestment campaigns focused on schools  states  and mutual funds are gathering momentum   Well targeted advocacy related to China s role in Sudan can help promote a more constructive attitude in Beijing   Activists    particularly religious groups    are helping to put the issue of the North South peace deal back on the radar screen  And the anti genocide movement is growing by the day   It is long past time for the US to exert effective leadership to end the first genocide of the 21st century and work to ensure that it is the last                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions
