   In Letter to Bush  Obama Raises Concerns Over VA Nominee   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           In Letter to Bush  Obama Raises Concerns Over VA Nominee Thursday  April 12  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt   Brig  Gen  Kussman aware of serious problems at Walter Reed as early as 2004 WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today wrote a letter to President Bush expressing his concerns over the nomination of Brig  Gen  Michael Kussman to the position of Under Secretary for Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs   According to a report published yesterday in Salon  Kussman oversaw the VA   s Seamless Transition Task Force that found serious problems at Walter Reed as early as 2004     yet it remains unclear whether Kussman and the task force acted aggressively to expose and rectify the problems   The text of the letter is below    Dear Mr  President   I am writing to express my serious concerns over your nomination of Brig  Gen  Michael J  Kussman to the position of Under Secretary for Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA    According to a recent story in the online newsmagazine Salon  Dr  Kussman knew of serious problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as early as 2004    At the time  Dr  Kussman was co chair of VA   s Seamless Transition Task Force and oversaw a focus group study with wounded servicemembers and their family members   The report that was produced led to the following conclusion      All of their comments reflect a lack of a clear documented process at Walter Reed for helping OIF OEF servicemembers transition to VA      The report also stated that servicemembers were    frustrated  confused  sometimes angry    over their experiences at Walter Reed and that soldiers without family support were    depressed and sad and by themselves      And in some cases  according to the report  family members and soldiers felt that they had to apologize for needing help from the Army at Walter Reed   If the servicemembers    comments in the focus group report were conveyed to top VA leaders as reported by Salon  then the question is why Dr  Kussman did not act more aggressively with the Defense Department to address these serious concerns   Before the Senate Veterans    Affairs Committee considers Dr  Kussman   s nomination  I ask that you direct VA Secretary James Nicholson to release all other reports  recommendations  briefings  and actions performed by the Seamless Transition Task Force   Members of the Committee should be able to assess   When VA first obtained this troubling information about bureaucratic delays at Walter Reed   What actions VA leaders took in 2004 to work with the DOD to streamline portions of the bureaucracy and assist servicemembers  and  Whether Dr  Kussman and other top leaders at VA could have     and should have    intervened earlier and more aggressively to share this information within VA as well as with Defense Department officials in a joint effort to improve care for our returning service members and their families   Before the Senate proceeds to confirm Dr  Kussman in this new role  we owe due diligence to our recovering servicemembers and veterans to get to the bottom of these serious allegations        Sincerely       Barack Obama   United States Senator
