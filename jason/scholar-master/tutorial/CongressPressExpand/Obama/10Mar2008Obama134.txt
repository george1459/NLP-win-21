   Obama Cosponsors One Year Moratorium on All Congressional Earmarks   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Cosponsors One Year Moratorium on All Congressional Earmarks Monday  March 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on his decision to cosponsor an amendment offered by Senator Jim DeMint to implement a one year moratorium on all congressional earmarks during the FY 2009 appropriations cycle     As a U S  Senator  I have long fought for greater transparency and accountability in federal spending   One of the legislative accomplishments of which I am most proud is a law I authored to create a searchable database of all federal contracts and grants   I also have championed greater disclosure requirements for earmarks to ensure that the public knows which member of Congress is sponsoring an earmark  However  even with all of these reforms  I have come to believe that the system is broken   We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress  seniority  rather than the merit of the project   We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or non profit group has to hire high priced D C  lobbyists to do it   And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country   The entire earmarks process needs to be re examined and reformed   For that reason  I will be supporting Senator DeMint s amendment and will not be requesting earmarks this year for Illinois   Over the next year  I hope to work with my colleagues  both Democratic and Republican  to improve the earmarks process                                     Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
