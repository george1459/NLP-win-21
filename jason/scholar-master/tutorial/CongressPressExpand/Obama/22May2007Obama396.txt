Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras raising serious concerns about whether the FTC has adequately protected America s seniors from abusive telemarketing fraud schemes  According to a report in Sunday   s New York Times  millions of our nation   s senior citizens are at risk of being robbed of their good credit standing  life savings and privacy   In the letter  Senator Obama says that while telemarketing may help seniors maintain access to products and services  seniors must be protected from exploitation  identity theft  and privacy violations   He calls on the FTC to aggressively enforce the law to ensure that the consumer protection challenges faced by vulnerable populations like seniors are addressed  The full text of the letter is below   The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20580   Dear Chairman Majoras   Yesterday  the New York Times published an investigation into telemarketing fraud schemes that exploit vulnerable American seniors  often robbing them of their dignity  their good credit  and even the life savings and financial resources they rely on to pay for food or medication    I am writing to express my concern that the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  is not doing more to deter such schemes and to protect elderly consumers from abusive and fraudulent telemarketing practices   The New York Times story highlighted the ways in which scam artists purchase databases of names of elderly Americans    These lists include names of    Elderly Opportunity Seekers   seniors  looking for ways to make money     Suffering Seniors   people with cancer or Alzheimer s disease   and  Oldies but Goodies   gamblers over 55 years old     Armed with these lists  criminals are able to prey on vulnerable seniors     people like Iowan Richard Guthrie  a 92 year old Army veteran  who lost  100 000 from scams     There is no question that telemarketing and electronic commerce represent important ways for many seniors to participate in the economy as merchants and consumers  But there is also no question that remote transactions present new risks of privacy violations  identity theft  and exploitation of potentially vulnerable consumers     The government must ensure that consumer protection and law enforcement authorities have the right priorities  tools  technologies  and resources to keep up with the evolving threats faced by American consumers    We cannot allow our elderly parents and grandparents to be so easily preyed upon by unscrupulous data brokers and others complicit in deceptive mailings  marketing scams  and outright fraud    The FTC is charged with protecting consumers from fraud  deception  and unfair business practices  The Commission is responsible for enforcing our nation s consumer protection laws and developing rules and procedures to protect and educate consumers  Given this clear mandate  the widespread and sophisticated abuse of many seniors raises a number of questions    What if anything is the FTC doing to assess and address the particular consumer protection challenges faced by seniors or other groups of American consumers who may be especially vulnerable to abuse   In particular  what is the FTC doing to regulate the sale of telemarketing databases to companies that are under investigation or have been prosecuted for fraud   How have FTC resources been allocated to protect rising numbers of seniors who are conducting remote consumer transactions at increasing rates    Are additional resources necessary and for what priority purposes  What if any programs exist to assist seniors with questions or complaints about marketing practices of which they may have been victims    What are the utilization rates of these programs over the past ten years   Have these programs been evaluated  and with what results  Is there adequate coordination between the FTC  the Federal Reserve  and the Department of Justice to ensure effective prevention and prosecution of marketing abuse    What if any multi agency initiatives are currently underway or planned for the near future   Please give specific examples of enforcement actions that have been taken recently against data brokers  telemarketers  or enabling financial institutions   What if any changes to regulatory authority or direction are necessary to enable the FTC to fulfill its consumer protection mandate in light of evolving marketing  communication  and transaction technologies     An FTC that is aggressively enforcing the law is critical to protecting American consumers in a vibrant  fast paced economy    Please respond to the questions above by June 8  2007  I look forward to working with your office to ensure that consumers of all ages can have confidence in their conversations with telemarketers and in all their consumer transactions    Sincerely      Barack Obama  United States Senator
