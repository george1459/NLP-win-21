   Obama  McCaskill Statement on Military Family Job Protection   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Obama  McCaskill Statement on Military Family Job Protection Tuesday  September 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Contact  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill  WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  today submitted the following testimony to the U S  House of Representatives Workforce Protections Subcommittee hearing on job protection for military families    Below is a statement by Senator Obama and Senator McCaskill      Madam Chairman  thank you for providing us with the opportunity to present testimony today to the House Workforce Protections Subcommittee   We are grateful that the committee has chosen to examine the fundamental question of how we can best provide the care and support our veterans and military families deserve      Since the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan began  our service members have performed bravely and brilliantly  and they have done everything we have asked of them   Our military families have also made incredible sacrifices   Waiting and praying  they manage the stress and uncertainty of long  repeated deployments  And when their loved ones return home  they are there to help them heal from the physical     and sometimes less visible     wounds of war     Given these sacrifices  and given that three out of every five deployed service members have family responsibilities at home  Congress must ask if we are truly meeting our commitment to our military families   Providing our service members and their families with the care and compassion they deserve is the very least we owe these heroes     The unacceptable shortcomings in care at Walter Reed highlighted the fact that our nation has not always matched words with action when it comes to caring for our service members  veterans and their families   Anyone who has taken the time to visit Walter Reed  as we have  has met spouses who don   t view visiting hours as a part time job   Day after day  these family members help their wounded loved ones persevere through what is often a lengthy and painful rehabilitation process       We must show our veterans and military families that we will help them with the basics  including access to health care  counseling and vocational training     all measures from our Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act that the Senate adopted this summer   But we must also focus on their job security  When America   s sons and daughters are injured overseas and they return home to begin their recovery  their families should not be forced to choose between caring for a wounded family member and keeping their jobs       That   s why in February we first proposed the idea of extending job protections for our military families   Our Military Family Job Protection Act  S  1885  would provide family members with up to one year of protected leave to care for a wounded loved one   Our approach also calls on the Secretary of Defense to consult with the Labor Department and develop a certification process that minimizes the administrative burden and helps free our military families from a web of red tape and bureaucratic delay     Our bill provides 12 months of job protection  which we believe is the necessary amount of time to help family members caring for a wounded service member   In addition  the protections we propose would be provided through channels similar to those utilized to provide job protections for reserve component military service members called to serve on active duty   In many ways  the family members we are trying to assist are similar to military service members being called to active duty   Just as we protect activated service members for the duration of their combat tour  we must seek to protect family members for the duration of their tour of duty caring for their wounded loved ones     Our proposal has bipartisan support and has been endorsed by Veterans for America   We urge our colleagues in Congress to support this common sense solution and send the Military Family Job Protection Act to the president for his signature        Madam Chairman  thank you again for inviting us to offer this testimony
