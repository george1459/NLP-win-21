Antiaircraft Missiles  Stolen WMDs and Conventional Weapons used in Improvised Roadside Bombs   WASHINGTON   The U S  Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed out of committee  S  2566  the Lugar Obama Act   Modeled after the Nunn Lugar program that focuses on weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union  the bill was introduced by Sens  Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  to expand the cooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons     Lugar Obama would expand the detection and interdiction of weapons and materials of mass destruction    A full list of the legislation  nominations and treaties passed out of committee and headed to the Senate floor is available at      The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the number one national security threat that confronts the United States today   Under Senator Lugar s leadership  the Nunn Lugar program has safely disposed of literally thousands of weapons of mass destruction which  had they fallen into the wrong hands  could have been used against America with catastrophic results   The Lugar Obama bill will build on this success by helping other nations find and eliminate conventional weapons that have been used against our own soldiers in Iraq and sought by terrorists all over the world   said Obama      We are convinced that the United States can and should do more to eliminate conventional weapons stockpiles and assist other nations in detecting and interdicting weapons of mass destruction   We believe that these functions are underfunded  fragmented and in need of high level support   Lugar said     We are particularly concerned that our government has the capacity to deal quickly with vulnerable stockpiles of shoulder fired anti aircraft missiles  known as MANPADS   In recent years  concerns have grown that such weapons could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations  and government facilities here at home and abroad   Al Qaeda reportedly has attempted to acquire MANPADS on a number of occasions   said Lugar    The first part of the Lugar Obama legislation would energize the U S  program against unsecured lightweight anti aircraft missiles and other conventional weapons   There may be as many as 750 000 man portable air defense systems in arsenals worldwide  and the State Department estimates that more than 40 civilian aircraft have been hit by such weapons since the 1970s   In addition  loose stocks of small arms and other weapons help fuel civil wars in Africa and elsewhere and provide the means for attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers seeking to stabilize war torn societies   In Iraq  unsecured stockpiles of artillery shells and ammunition have been reconfigured into improvised explosive devices  IEDs  that have become the insurgents  most effective weapon     The second part of Lugar Obama would strengthen the ability of America s allies to detect and interdict illegal shipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction   U S  security depends not just on the willingness of other nations to help  it depends on whether they have the capabilities to be effective   The State Department engages in several related anti terrorism and export control assistance programs   But these programs are focused on other stages of the threat  not on detection and interdiction  and create a gap in our defenses that needs to be filled    The Lugar Obama bill would increase by  25 million funding available for the elimination of conventional weapons and MANPADS and by  50 million funding to assist countries in improving their ability to detect and interdict materials and weapons of mass destruction   This offers a potent but flexible tool to build a robust international network to stop proliferation     Lugar and Obama traveled together to Russia  Ukraine and Azerbaijan in August to oversee a number of Nunn Lugar projects   In Ukraine they saw a conventional weapons facility that is typical of the focus of the new legislation    In 1991  Senator Lugar  R IN  and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the Nunn Lugar Act  which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  This program has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  In 1997  Lugar and Nunn were joined by Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  which expanded Nunn Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American cities  In 2003  Congress adopted the Nunn Lugar Expansion Act  which authorized the Nunn Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats  In October 2004  Nunn Lugar funds were used for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to secure chemical weapons in Albania  under a Lugar led expansion of the program    The latest Nunn Lugar Scorecard shows that the program has deactivated or destroyed  6 828 nuclear warheads  611 ICBMs  485 ICBM silos  55 ICBM mobile missile launchers  152 bombers  865 nuclear air to surface missiles  436 submarine missile launchers  563 submarine launched missiles  29 nuclear submarines  and 194 nuclear test tunnels    Beyond the scorecard s nuclear elimination  the Nunn Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons  and works to reemploy scientists and facilities related to biological weapons in peaceful research initiatives  The International Science and Technology Centers  of which the United States is the leading sponsor  have engaged 58 000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work  The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded 750 projects involving 14 000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high tech jobs  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn Lugar program  They otherwise would be the world s the third  fourth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers  respectively
