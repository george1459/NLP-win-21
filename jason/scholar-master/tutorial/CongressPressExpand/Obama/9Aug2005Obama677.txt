or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  July 25  2005  Obama Applauds EPA s Commitment to Write Long Delayed Laws to Protect Kids from Lead Paint   WASHINGTON   In a letter to U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  Administrator Stephen L  Johnson  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Monday said that he is pleased by EPA s commitment to write long delayed regulations to protect children from dangerous lead paint exposure    Renovation and repair of older residences is the principal source of lead paint exposure to U S  children  According to federal studies  a large majority of the approximately 20 30 million renovations done on older homes each year are done without lead safe cleanup and contamination practices  Over 430 000 children in America have dangerously high levels of lead in their blood    In 1992  Congress required the EPA to write regulations relating to the dispersal of lead paint by contractors during home remodeling by October  1996  As of July 2005  these regulations still have not been written  In April  Administrator Johnson stated that to address the problem of lead paint poisoning  the EPA  will determine what additional steps may be necessary  including regulation  despite the fact that the 1992 law does not say the regulations are optional    When asked about the status of these regulations before the EPW Committee two weeks ago  Deputy Administrator designate Marcus Peacock stated    As I understand it  the Agency will announce by the end of this year a comprehensive program  which will include a proposed regulation  as well as an extensive education and outreach campaign aimed at the renovation  repair  and painting industry and the consumer     Obama also received a letter from Susan Hazen  Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator  which said   the Agency plans to announce by the end of this year  a comprehensive program that will include a proposed rule     In light of commitments I have received from Mr  Peacock and Ms  Hazen  I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr  Peacock for the deputy administrator position   Obama wrote   However  I want you to know that I will be closely monitoring EPA s actions regarding lead paint and will expect proposed rules to be issued by December 31  2005     Full text of the letter below     July 25  2005   The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  401 M Street  SW  Washington  DC  20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    As you may know  I have been concerned about the failure of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to promulgate regulations pursuant to 15 U S C  S2682 c  3    This provision requires EPA to issue rules for contractors to reduce lead exposure during home renovation and remodeling by October 1996   Almost nine years later  these rules still have not been issued  and I have spent the past few months trying to understand why    When your nomination was considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works  EPW  Committee in April  I asked you when EPA was going to issue these rules   You stated that EPA was focusing on a voluntary education and outreach program and  will evaluate the effectiveness of this effort and will determine what additional steps may be necessary  including regulation    Of course  15 U S C  S2682 c  3  does not give EPA the option of whether to promulgate regulations     In May  Sen  Boxer  Rep  Waxman  and I wrote a follow up letter to you  asking once again when EPA would issue these rules on lead   We received no response for two months    In June  I included an amendment in the EPA appropriations bill that would prohibit the agency from spending any funds to delay the implementation of 15 U S C  S2682 c  3    That bill passed the Senate unanimously    When Deputy Administrator designate Marcus Peacock appeared before the EPW Committee two weeks ago  I asked him about the status of these lead rules   Responding to written questions that I submitted to him after the hearing  Mr  Peacock stated    As I understand it  the Agency will announce by the end of this year a comprehensive program  which will include a proposed regulation  as well as an extensive education and outreach campaign aimed at the renovation  repair  and painting industry and the consumer     I am pleased by Mr  Peacock s statement  which is a significant departure from your response in April   I am also encouraged by a letter I received last week from Susan Hazen  Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator  responding to my May letter   Ms  Hazen reiterated that  the Agency plans to announce by the end of this year  a comprehensive program that will include a proposed rule     In light of the commitments I received from Mr  Peacock and Ms  Hazen  I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr  Peacock for the deputy administrator position   However  I want you to know that I will be closely monitoring EPA s actions regarding lead paint and will expect you to honor your commitment to issue these proposed rules by December 31  2005     I look forward to working with you on this important issue     Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator
