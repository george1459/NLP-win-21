   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Destruction of CIA Interrogation Tapes   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Destruction of CIA Interrogation Tapes Friday  December  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 The following statement was submitted by Senator Obama in the Congressional Record today  Mr  President  I wish to express my serious concern over the Central Intelligence Agency   s confirmation that videotapes depicting brutal interrogation techniques were destroyed   First  it is important that we note the broader context of this debate  The United States of America is a nation born out of a struggle against tyranny  and our founding legal document asserts that the rule of law applies to all men and women  and all branches and agencies of government  We are not a perfect nation  but our national greatness is marked by our ability to rise above our imperfections through our allegiance to our values and to the rule of law  Time and again  America has triumphed because of the contrast we draw to tyranny  We are a nation that set captives free  shut down torture chambers  and extended freedom and international law to more of humanity   Now  we are engaged in a new kind of conflict  And the question that we have faced since September 11  2001  is how we are going to respond to the shadowy  stateless  terrorist enemies of the 21st century   Tragically  the Bush Administration has too often chosen to respond to this enemy by abandoning our values and ignoring laws that it deems inconvenient  So we have seen excessive secrecy  indefinite detention  warrantless wire tapping  and    enhanced interrogation techniques    like simulated drowning that qualify as torture through any careful measure of the law or appeal to human decency  For each of these new policies  we have seen dubious legal reasoning that does not stand up to the harsh light of review or the sound judgment of our Constitution   Yesterday  we learned that in November 2005  the CIA destroyed videotapes of its interrogations of two prominent al Qaeda suspects  including a close Osama bin Laden associate     Abu Zubayadah  Media reports suggest that these videotapes depict brutal interrogation techniques  and could certainly be relevant to ongoing investigations and inquiries  Furthermore  these videotapes were not provided to the 9 11 Commission  which made a broad set of requests for classified documents     including interrogation tapes and transcripts     that would have included information about the 9 11 attacks   The CIA has argued that these tapes needed to be destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators  Our government must go to any length necessary to protect the identities of those who serve in a covert capacity  But the CIA keeps scores of classified material     including videotapes     while protecting the identities of its agents  This raises serious questions about whether the tapes were destroyed to protect the nature of the interrogation  rather than the identity of the interrogator   Mr  President  this incident deserves further congressional oversight and inquiry     neither the CIA nor this interrogation program is immune to our laws  This is yet another chapter in a dark period in our constitutional history  Now  it is time to turn the page  That is why I was heartened to learn that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have reached agreement on including a requirement in the Intelligence Authorization bill that subjects CIA interrogators to the guidelines on interrogation included in the U S  Army Field Manual  It would be a grave disappointment     though not surprising     if this important step forward were subject to a veto threat from the President  That must not deter the Congress from moving forward  We have a responsibility to act   We should not have a separate interrogation program whose methods are so abhorrent that they cannot stand up to scrutiny  We should not have to find ways of ignoring or averting our own laws to defend our country  Torture does not work  Torture violates our laws  And torture sets back the standing and moral leadership that America needs to triumph in this global struggle  Our values and laws are not inconvenient obstacles to the defense of our national security     they can and must be a guiding force in our response to terrorism  Mr  President  today is Pearl Harbor day     a date when our nation was subjected to a terrible surprise attack  and when a generation of Americans answered the call to defend our security and extend the cause of freedom  More than six years after 9 11  we are still struggling to define our own response to our generation   s terrible surprise attack  As we defend America  let us learn the painful lessons of these last few years  and enlist our values and our Constitution in this first great struggle of the 21st century   I thank the President and yield the floor
