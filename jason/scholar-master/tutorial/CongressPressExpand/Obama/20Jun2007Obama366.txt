   Obama Statement on Coal to Liquid Fuel Proposals   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Coal to Liquid Fuel Proposals Tuesday  June 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  released the following statement on the coal to liquid fuel proposals considered by the Senate today    Achieving energy independence and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions are two of the greatest challenges America faces   With the right technological innovations  coal has the potential to be a cleaner burning  domestic alternative to imported oil   However we are not there yet   The Bunning amendment would have been premature in requiring the production of billions of gallons of coal to liquids without providing strong environmental safeguards to ensure that this new fuel alleviates  not worsens  our climate crisis  The Tester amendment  on the other hand  gives us the tools to determine whether we can make coal into a clean fuel source  We cannot solve the climate crisis without addressing coal     which generates half of America s electricity       Moving forward  I believe we should only invest in coal to liquid fuels that burn at least 20 percent less lifecycle carbon emissions than conventional fuels    I also introduced a low carbon fuel standard to mandate a 10 percent reduction in emissions for all vehicle fuels by 2020  with incentives for producers to make their fuels more efficient and to exceed that level  without prejudging which fuel will turn out to be the best for our environment and our economy
