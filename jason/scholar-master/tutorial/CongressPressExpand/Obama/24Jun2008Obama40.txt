         Senators Seek Tax Relief for Flood and Tornado Victims in the Midwest  Tuesday  June 24  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C     Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   Claire McCaskill  D MO   Kit Bond  R MO   Richard Lugar  R IN   Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Evan Bayh  D IN  have filed an amendment to the housing legislation that s pending in the Senate   The amendment is a tax relief measure designed to help people and communities in Midwestern states hard hit over the last month by floods and tornados  The senators said the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief bill is modeled after tax legislation that Congress passed to help victims of the tornado in Kiowa County  Kansas in 2007 and Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma in 2005   The new proposal contains provisions that would let disaster victims withdraw money from retirement plans without tax penalties  suspend limits on tax incentives for charitable contributions  create tax exempt bond authority to help rebuild infrastructure  remove limitations on deducting casualty losses due to natural disaster  and allow additional depreciation and increased amounts for expensing property to help businesses   As residents continue to battle the flooding back home in Illinois  I will continue to work in Washington to see that they have access to every federal recovery tool   Durbin said    Tax relief has proven to be extremely useful in helping people and communities get back on their feet after a major disaster   I hope Congress will act swiftly so Illinoisans will have immediate access to relief funds as soon as the President makes a disaster declaration for Illinois    Families and communities across Illinois have suffered so much due to this year s flooding  and we must do everything we can to help them recover and begin to rebuild   said Obama    I am proud to support this amendment to offer tax relief and assistance to the victims of this disaster   I will continue to work with Senator Durbin and my colleagues to help rebuild the Midwest in the days and weeks ahead     Tax relief has been important and helpful to tornado and hurricane victims in recent years  and it s just as important for people in Iowa and other Midwestern states this year who have been wiped out by flooding and tornados  including an EF5 tornado in Parkersburg  Iowa   Grassley said    The sooner Congress acts on this disaster tax relief  the better   People are working day and night to put their lives and their communities back together   There s so much hurt  but people are determined to get through it and rebuild   Given the enormity of the loss in Iowa  I hope Congress can find a way to act quickly to help through tax relief  along with other measures     Iowans and our neighbors in the Midwest have endured a tough year with floods  tornadoes and other natural disasters   Harkin said    While the storms may be behind us  many families have experienced huge losses   loss of their homes  belongings and livelihoods  Communities large and small are facing the daunting task of rebuilding their entire infrastructure  Now is the time to offer relief and assistance to the people of Iowa and the Midwest     Missourians are in a world of hurt right now   Many of our small communities  thousands of businesses and homes  have been devastated by rising flood waters   This amendment will help to make sure that America s heartland will have the resources they need to recover from the floods   McCaskill said   Too often  Missourians are reminded of nature s tremendous devastating power   Bond said    These provisions will help Missourians and other Midwestern families recover after being hard hit by Mother Nature   It is critical that we provide our communities the resources they need to get back on their feet     Disasters can take away lives  they can destroy homes  and they can wipe away roads and bridges  But in America  we won t let them take away our spirit of community   Klobuchar said    At a time like this  local communities should not be expected to fend for themselves   this relief will help these communities begin to recover and rebuild from the devastating flooding in the Midwest     In the last several weeks  thousands of residents in Indiana  like so many across the Midwest  have had their lives chaotically disrupted by storms  tornadoes and floods   Bayh said   Time is not our ally in getting resources to ravaged communities  Congress must move quickly to pass this legislation  and then we must act to appropriate additional funds  to deliver critical aid to storm victims so they can rebuild their homes  their businesses and their lives   A summary of the amendment filed this morning is below   The legislation would benefit Iowa  Illinois  Missouri  Indiana  Kansas  Minnesota  Wisconsin  Michigan and
