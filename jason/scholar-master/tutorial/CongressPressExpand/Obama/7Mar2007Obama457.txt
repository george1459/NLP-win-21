   Obama Initiative Would Greatly Increase Risk Based Homeland Security Funding   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Initiative Would Greatly Increase Risk Based Homeland Security Funding Tuesday  March  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Contact  Ben LaBolt 202 228 5511 Roemer says amendment would allow the    full spirit    of the 9 11 Commission   s recommendations to be realized  WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sponsored an initiative recommended by the 9 11 Commission that would increase the amount of homeland security funding that is allocated based on risk  instead of shared equally between states   The 9 11 Commission Report states             Federal homeland security assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing   It should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support     p  396        Five long years after 9 11  homeland security funding is still being treated as a pork barrel     said Senator Obama      States that face the greatest threats should receive the most funding  to secure their infrastructure and prepare their first responders   A flea market on a roadside and a metropolitan transit system do not carry the same risks  and they should not be treated equally   To honor the victims and to arm ourselves to prevent another attack  states must demonstrate risks and vulnerabilities to receive significant funding      The Obama amendment to the homeland security bill would decrease the current minimum funding each state receives under the State Homeland Security Grant program to  25 percent  with an increase to  45 percent for border states     a proposal consistent with the House version of the bill   S  4 currently proposes that all states receive a minimum of  45 percent of the state homeland security grants   Currently  the state minimum is  75 percent  consuming approximately 40 percent of the program   s funds   Former 9 11 Commissioners Lee Hamilton and Tim Roemer wrote letters in support of Senator Obama   s amendment   Referring to the Commission   s Report Card on progress since 9 11  Roemer said     On homeland security  the government received an F because too many of our vulnerabilities received too few resources   We cannot afford to waste any more money  time  or effort       I commend these efforts to move the Senate in a better direction and believe this amendment creates the opportunity for the full spirit of the 9 11 Commission   s recommendations to be realized in conference with the House      Hamilton wrote      Resources for homeland security are not unlimited  so it is thus essential that they be distributed based upon a careful analysis of the risk  vulnerability  and potential consequences of a terrorist attack   Adopting such a risk based approach would make the best use of our homeland security resources  and would make the American people safer      The full text of Senator Obama   s floor remarks on the amendment is below   It was a typical fall day in New York City   People were headed to work   Cars were stuck in traffic   The subways were packed   And construction crews were busy rebuilding at Ground Zero   Nearby  Con Ed personnel were at work in a manhole and they made a tragic discovery  ID tags and human remains not seen since that other fall day five years earlier   The City paused again   It launched another effort to recover and identify those taken from us on that dark September day   The recovery continues after all this time   The recovery continues five and a half years later  and just last week more victims were unearthed   After all this time  we are still recovering from September 11   Our prayers remain with the family members and friends who still mourn and miss the fathers and mothers and children who made their lives complete   This is why we are here   We are here to do the work that ensures that no other family member has to lose a loved one to a terrorist who turns a plane into a missile  a terrorist who straps a bomb around her waist and climbs aboard a bus  a terrorist who figures out how to set off a dirty bomb in one of our cities   This is why we are here  to make our country safer and make sure that the nearly 3 000 lives that were taken from us did not die in vain   Their legacy will be a safer and more secure nation   That is what lies at the heart of this 9 11 bill  It   s not just about how we send the money from Washington to the states and local governments   It is about saving lives and doing everything in our power to prevent another attack   to prevent another tragedy   to ensure that no one climbs down a manhole  expecting to do their work  only to find the deceased left in darkness five years earlier   That is why we are here  to protect our people   Now  most of us had hoped that these steps would have been taken many years ago   That we would have capitalized on the unity and the national spirit we shared after the Towers fell  the Pentagon was hit  and the Pennsylvania field smoldered   Well  it is never too late to do what is right for our country   It has been more than two and a half years since the 9 11 Commission issued its report   Not only did the panel of dedicated Americans research what happened that day  but they also gave a list of serious recommendations about how to make our country safer in the future   The 9 11 Commission showed us how to move beyond the politics of division in order to achieve the solemn task of better protecting our country   In its report  the Commission said the following    quote     Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities  and  federal homeland security assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing      end of quote    This is one of the goals of the 9 11 Commission   My amendment moves us closer to a true system of risk based allocation of state homeland security grants and ensures that funding goes to areas most at risk of terrorist attacks   This isn   t an issue of big states versus little states or urban states versus rural states   It   s about good policy and about maximizing our use of the people   s money   Today  the system is set up so that all states receive at least 0 75 percent of the State Homeland Security Grant program dollars   After each state receives that minimum level of funding  the dollars are then allocated according to risk   As a result  the current amount of state minimum funding eats up approximately 40 percent of that funding    While the new bill does attempt to address this problem and I applaud Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins for trying to bring the 0 75 percent down to 0 45 percent  the bill doesn   t go far enough   It is a good first step  but we   re already 50 yards behind  sending too much money to areas where there aren   t real risks  threats  and vulnerabilities    That is why we must use the most dollars in those areas that are at the greatest risk of an attack   We can   t afford to waste a single cent on places that don   t need immediate help when first responders in major cities still lack the basic communications equipment they need to talk to one another if heaven forbid tragedy strikes again   That is why the Families of 9 11 recently issued a statement  saying    quote     Reports of air conditioned garbage trucks being purchased with homeland security funds are indicative of the frivolity that results from non risk based allocation methods   When the threat against our nation is so real  we cannot afford not to take it seriously      end of quote   That is why the 9 11 Commission said that Congress shouldn   t use this money as pork barrel    That is why in 2005  the Commission issued a report card  giving the nation an    F    for risk based funding   That is why 9 11 Commission chairman Lee Hamilton recently sent me a letter   He wrote    quote     Since 9 11  and since the issuance of our report  the United States has not allocated homeland security resources wisely   Resources for homeland security are not unlimited  so it is thus essential that they be distributed based upon a careful analysis of the risk  vulnerability  and potential consequences of a terrorist attack  Adopting such a risk based approach would make the best use of our homeland security resources  and would make the American people safer      end of quote   That is why 9 11 Commissioner Tim Roemer wrote in support of this amendment  saying   quote     We cannot afford to waste any more money  time or effort      end of quote   And that is why the amendment I offer today     a bi partisan amendment with the support of Senators Warner  Coburn  Landrieu  Kennedy  Menendez  Clinton and Schumer     reduces the guaranteed state minimum to 0 25 percent and allow those states on our northern and southern borders to see an increased minimum of 0 45 percent   This basic framework was adopted by a wide bipartisan margin in the House in January   It is time for all of us to approach homeland security funding not as something we can bring home to the states we represent  but funding we can use to better protect the United States of America   As we lower the guaranteed amount  we increase the funding available to protect those places most at risk   And 40 states will receive either the same amount or an increase in the funding they need to better protect our borders  our ports  our railroads  our subways  our chemical plants  our nuclear power plants  our food supply and our fire fighters  police officers and EMT   s   We have waited more than five years to better develop our approach to funding our security in a post 9 11 world   Sometimes division and politics have prevented us from doing what we need to do   But I believe that those days are finally behind us   We have a real chance to not only learn from our mistakes  but to get the job done and better protect our people   That is why we are here  to make our country as safe and secure as we can   That is the common cause we all share   The American people need to see that in us   The 9 11 Commission expects that from us   And the victims    families and friends are owed that from us   We will never forget those who died    We will never forget those who are suffering and sick because of their heroism that day   We will never forget that 60 percent of the victims were never identified   We will never forget that we are still recovering from 9 11   And that is why our work goes on
