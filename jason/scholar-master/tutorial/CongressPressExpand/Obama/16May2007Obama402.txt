   Obama Statement on Today   s Iraq Vote   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Today   s Iraq Vote Wednesday  May 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt 202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC        Today  1519 days after it began  the war in Iraq rages on  with no sign of a resolution          The Iraqi people appear no closer to settling their differences  The Iraqi government is more divided and dysfunctional than ever   The Iraqi parliament speaks of adjourning for the summer  without addressing the major issues standing in the way of a ceasefire   And our brave young servicemen and women are still fighting and dying to police someone else s civil war          I opposed this war from the start for all the reasons that are now clear          In January  I introduced a plan that if it had been passed would have already begun redeploying our troops out of Iraq   The reason I believe that this plan is the best plan is that it would also offer enough flexibility to delay our exit in the event that the Iraqis responded with meaningful steps toward peace          My plan makes it clear if the Iraqi government does not meet specific benchmarks  all U S  combat troops will be out of Iraq by March 31  2008   It has been nearly five months since I introduced my plan  and by every objective measure  the Iraqis are nowhere close to meeting the benchmarks I laid out in January          I still believe in that approach  using our military presence in Iraq as leverage to press the Iraqis towards a political settlement   Ultimately  I think it will become the framework for a bipartisan coalition the President can t resist          Unfortunately  the President vetoed that plan   In response  I have reintroduced that plan and will continue to work to get the votes that are needed to override this veto          Today I supported the Reid Feingold plan  which would begin a withdrawal of troops in 120 days and end all combat operations on April 1  2008   I supported this proposal not because I believe it is the best answer  but because I want to send a strong statement to the Iraqi government  the President and my Republican colleagues that it s long past time to change course in Iraq          This is our best hope to keep the pressure on so that we can bring this war to a responsible end and bring our troops home
