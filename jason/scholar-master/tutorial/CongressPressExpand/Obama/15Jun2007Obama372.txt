   Obama Low Carbon Fuel Initiative Would Equal Taking 30 Million Cars Off the Road   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Low Carbon Fuel Initiative Would Equal Taking 30 Million Cars Off the Road Thursday  June 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt Standard would reduce fuel emissions 10 percent by 2020 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today offered a low carbon fuel standard that would require a 10 percent reduction in fuel emissions by 2020  the equivalent of taking 30 million cars off the road  as an amendment to the energy bill  The amendment is based on the National Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act he introduced with Senator Harkin earlier this year   Senator Obama delivered the following remarks on the floor of the Senate        The facts about our nation   s energy consumption are not pretty          The U S  currently consumes one quarter of the world   s oil  60  of the oil that we consume comes from foreign countries  including many countries whose interests are hostile to ours   To make matters worse  the oil used in the U S  transportation sector accounts for one third of our nation   s emissions of greenhouse gases   It is long past time for the U S  to take significant steps to use oil more efficiently in order to deal with the dual challenges of climate change and energy dependence          In January of this year  California took an important first step towards addressing this problem by establishing a low carbon fuel standard for passenger vehicle fuels sold in the state   Under the California standard  the carbon intensity of these fuels would be reduced by 10 percent by 2020          In signing the executive order creating the low carbon fuel standard  Governor Schwarzenegger noted just some of the dangers of his state   s excessive reliance on gasoline   volatile oil prices dictated by hostile foreign countries  lack of economic security  American jobs at risk  businesses in jeopardy  and most importantly  dangerous levels of greenhouse gas emissions          I applaud the Governor   s leadership on this issue  and now I want to take his proposal one giant step further   Today  I rise to discuss an amendment that I have introduced to establish a national low carbon fuel standard for the entire transportation fuel pool in this country     whether the fuel is used for cars  trucks  or airplanes          If my proposal were to become law  by the year 2015  the carbon emissions in our national fuel supply would be 5 percent less than they are now   By the year 2020  the carbon emissions would be 10 percent less          The effect of these seemingly modest reductions would be significant   According to one estimate  a national low carbon fuel standard would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 million metric tons in 2020   This is the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road in 2020          My approach would reduce carbon emissions overall in the transportation fuel pool  but it wouldn   t dictate what feedstocks could satisfy the low carbon fuel standard or how many gallons of a particular fuel would have to be produced   Instead  fuels could be mixed and matched to achieve the carbon reduction targets          In essence  the market would dictate what pool of fuels would be sold in the U S  in order to satisfy the requirements   The fuels could be corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  biodiesel made from soybeans  electricity used by plug in hybrid vehicles  or perhaps some kind of fuel that hasn   t even been developed yet   The only requirement is that the overall mix of fuels sold in the U S  would have to meet the carbon reduction targets set forth in my proposal          This is a new concept     indeed  less than six months have passed since California adopted it    and I know some of my colleagues are not familiar with how it would work   So  let me address the relationship between the low carbon fuel standard and something we know a lot about    the Renewable Fuels Standard          Under the able leadership of the two senators from New Mexico  the Energy Committee has crafted the underlying bill to require greater volumes of biofuels in our national fuel supply   The bill increases national production goals in the RFS over the next 15 years and establishes the first production targets of next generation fuels such as cellulosics          Under the bill  the RFS target would increase to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by the year 2022   When combined with the new advanced biofuels requirements in the bill  this would result in an estimated 2 to 6 percent reduction in carbon emissions in our national fuel pool in 15 years   These are significant reductions  but I believe we can do better          My low carbon fuel standard would require a 10 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020   I know that sounds ambitious  but the magnitude of our nation   s problems demands bold and innovative action   Indeed  the experts with whom we have consulted firmly believe that a 10 percent reduction is realistic with greater research into advanced biofuels and new fuel sources   But that research will only happen if businesses are assured of a market for their new products   And just as the existing RFS has spurred the construction of ethanol plants  a low carbon fuel standard would incentivize the development of new advanced fuels          We in Congress support biofuels because these fuels strengthen our energy security  support our rural communities  and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions   But our current policy doesn   t recognize producers when they do a better job of achieving these goals   Our farmers  manufacturers  and investors are ready to produce better biofuels     fuels that are more efficient  fuels that support a broader base of rural communities  fuels that reduce greenhouse gases by 90  or more     but they need a signal that their investment in better performance will be recognized in the marketplace          Let me be clear     a low carbon fuel standard is not intended to replace the RFS  instead  the two standards would complement each other by encouraging greater use of renewable fuels   But here   s an important difference between the two standards   the RFS evaluates renewable fuel based on the feedstock that creates the fuel  while the low carbon fuel standard looks at the carbon emissions produced by the fuel   And that   s an important distinction as we wrestle with perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation     climate change          Going forward  it   s not enough just to say that a fuel uses home grown products like corn or soybeans   We also need to look at what effect the fuel has on carbon emissions   My proposal does that  and in doing so  offers something for everyone          If you support rural America  this approach ensures widespread development and use of biofuels from agriculture products          If you support energy security  this approach reduces our consumption of oil by 30 billion gallons by 2020     60  of which would have to be imported from foreign sources          If you support certainty for industry  this approach provides the market certainty that is critical for investment dollars in key technologies          And most importantly  if you support the environment  this approach reduces carbon emissions by 180 metric tons by 2020 and ensures that any future billon dollar capital investment in a fuel plant would have to produce a fuel with better lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than conventional gasoline   Because under a low carbon fuel standard  there would be no place for carbon intensive fuels          The energy debate this week underscores the fact that  as we pursue the best course of action for our energy independence  there are no perfect answers   There is no single fuel or feedstock that offers the best combination of affordability  reliability  transportability  and sensitivity to the environment      and even if there were  I   m not sure we here in this chamber would be the most qualified to identify it          But  our current course     that is  maintaining our dependency on unstable regions of the world for the fuel that we cannot live without     is far too great a risk to delay action   That requires us to take aggressive action that will set the stage for the second and third generation of fuels that will truly help us achieve energy independence and fight global warming   A low carbon fuel standard accomplishes these goals          Finally  let me say a word to my colleagues about climate change   Now I know that when it comes to the word    carbon     the range of views among my colleagues is varied and complex   I am among those Senators who believe carbon from human activities contributes to climate change  that it is an immediate threat  and that we must immediately require emission reductions through a strong cap and trade system   Others among my colleagues agree with some type of a carbon controlled economy  but disagree with the various legislative approaches to date   Still others believe the climate is in no imminent danger          My proposal addresses carbon  but it allows my colleagues to maintain their differences on the larger debate on climate change while coming together to achieve progress on all of our multiple policy goals     whether it   s ending our energy dependence  attacking the problem of climate change  promoting economic stability  or creating American jobs          I am fully aware that this proposal may be ahead of its time  but given the magnitude of our problems  we can   t afford to be too cautious in our policy solutions   I urge my colleagues to learn more about a low carbon fuel standard  and if they do so  I know they will see the merits of it
