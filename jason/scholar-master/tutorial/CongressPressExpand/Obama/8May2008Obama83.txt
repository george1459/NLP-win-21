5566 After Devastation of Cyclone  Resolution Asks that Roadblocks to Aid be Lifted  Evaluation of Aid Strategy  WASHINGTON  DC   The Senate has passed a resolution introduced by Senator John Kerry and a bipartisan group of 19 Senators urging humanitarian aid to the Burmese people following the devastation of the cyclone and accompanying tidal wave  There are currently 100 000 people dead and tens of thousands missing  with disease spreading rampantly throughout the flooded country  The resolution was cosponsored by Foreign Relations Chairman Joe Biden  D DE   Ranking Member Richard Lugar  R IN   Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY   along with Senators Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Dick Durbin  D IL   Chris Dodd  D CT   Barack Obama  D IL   Jim Webb  D VA   Lisa Murkowski  R AK   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Bob Menendez  D NJ    Russ Feingold  D WI   Joe Lieberman  D CT  Chuck Hagel  R NE   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Hillary Clinton  D N Y    Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Elizabeth Dole  R N C   The senators requested that the Bush Administration send the aid they have promised the troubled nation  and also sustain humanitarian aid to the Burmese people beyond the immediate crisis created by Cyclone Nargis  The resolution also asked that any restrictions placed by Burma s State Peace and Development Council on international non governmental organizations be lifted  so that they can freely lend assistance  medical attention and funds to the victims of the disaster  Lastly  the resolution asks that the United States Agency for International Development conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the organizations capable of navigating these political roadblocks to effectively lend assistance to the Burmese people   The full text of the resolution can be found at this     At this tragic moment  the United States has a responsibility to help the Burmese people and push the junta to allow humanitarian aid to get to the people who need it the most  freely and rapidly   said Kerry   This could be remembered as the moment when the United States and the world came to the aid of the Burmese people and made it clear that while we loathe the junta that has isolated Burma from the world and oppressed its citizens  we find common cause with the people of Burma and we will be there by their side at this difficult time    We re hearing reports that the death toll in Burma may reach over 100 000   making it one of the most fatal disasters in modern history   said Biden    The United States and the international community have a moral obligation to step up and offer immediate humanitarian assistance to the region    The Burmese government has to do its part as well  by allowing in aid workers and lifting restrictions on the flow of international assistance   Together  we must act now in order to prevent disease  starvation and a lack of resources from claiming even more lives    The U S  Senate makes this emphatic humanitarian statement  expressing our sympathy for the people of Burma  and encouraging that all possible assistance is extended quickly to them   said Lugar   My prayers go out to the families of those killed  injured or missing in this past weekend s natural disaster in Burma   said McConnell    It is my profound hope that the regime will permit the U S  to help the Burmese people recover from this tragedy    Cyclone Nargis has left a path of death and destruction in its wake  The people of Burma are in desperate need for food  shelter  medical assistance and other humanitarian aid   Feinstein said   It s our hope that the military regime will open the country to disaster assessment teams and international aid from the United States and other nations who stand ready to help    Cyclone Nargis has left a path of devastation and despair across Burma  and we must take immediate steps to help alleviate the dreadful living conditions that the survivors are facing   said Dodd    The road to recovery will be long  and we must stand ready to aid the Burmese people as they begin to pick up the pieces   In light of this unprecedented need for humanitarian aid  I sincerely hope that the State Peace and Development Council will lift current restrictions on foreign assistance in Burma and allow the United States to provide the aid that is so desperately needed    The tragedy in Burma is heartbreaking   said Obama    I support the United States  commitment to deploying disaster assistance and aid to the region  and I urge the Burmese government to take the steps necessary to ensure the international community can provide help to those who need it      Through tragedy  there may be some hope for the future for the citizens of Burma   After years of being isolated from the rest of the world  the United States along with the international community can use this opportunity to assist Burma and demonstrate good will towards the Burmese people   said Webb   The time is ripe to move beyond the strategy of isolation and sanctions and toward the goal of opening up Burma   I am hopeful that the administration will move forward in that spirit and that the Government of Burma will accept the outpouring of international aid and allow international relief organizations access throughout the country      I have the utmost sympathy and support for the people of Burma   said Murkowski    I want to assure them that the United States will provide assistance in this time of great need   As citizens of not only the United States  but of the whole world we must come to each other s aid in times of such terrible disasters    As the tragedy continues to unfold in Burma  the United States should take a firm leadership role in providing a decisive  generous humanitarian response   said Kennedy    The Burmese Government must do its part as well and allow assistance to reach those in need   Menendez said   We are standing together as Americans  as citizens of the world  ready and willing to do what it takes to help the Burmese people get food  water and shelter and recover as best they can from this unimaginable tragedy  Unless the ruling military junta in Burma lets international aid workers provide assistance freely throughout that nation  the mind boggling death tolls will rise and the extreme suffering will continue  Now is not a time to consolidate power  it is a time to accept the world s cooperation and compassion    The devastation caused by the cyclone in Burma is tragic and overwhelming but Americans stand ready to help the people of Burma in any way we can   Feingold said    The Burmese government must lift its restrictions and allow the international community to help prevent the further loss of life      This bipartisan resolution sends an unmistakable message to the Burmese people that the United States stands ready to help them in the wake of this terrible natural disaster  Rather than compounding the suffering of the Burmese people  it is now critical that the military junta put aside its paranoia  lift restrictions on the delivery of aid  and allow its people to receive the humanitarian relief they so desperately need   said Lieberman   Devastating humanitarian disasters like these do not heed borders  boundaries or political circumstances   They affect only the innocent  and we all need to work towards the common goal of easing their plight   I urge the Burmese Government to accept our offer of immediate humanitarian assistance   Hagel said   We in Louisiana understand the wrath of a catastrophic natural disaster   Landrieu said   Countries all over the world came to our aid in 2005  and we now have the moral responsibility to get aid to Burma as quickly and efficiently as we can to help the suffering survivors  The military junta must back down and let the international community bring critical resources to the Burmese people    From my time with the American Red Cross  I know first hand how important the humanitarian response is to those who are suffering   There is much to be done in the wake of Cyclone Nargis and time is of the essence   Aid to the people must not be hindered  and I urge the military junta to let the United States help   said Dole                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this
