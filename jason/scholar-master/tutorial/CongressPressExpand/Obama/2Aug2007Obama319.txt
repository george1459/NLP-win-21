   Obama Calls for the Expansion of Children   s Health Insurance   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls for the Expansion of Children   s Health Insurance Tuesday  July 31  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today spoke on the Senate floor to call for the expansion of the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP    As more Americans lose their health insurance everyday  CHIP has provided 6 million uninsured children with the health care they need  and encouraged states like Illinois to build on its success and expand health coverage even further   The reauthorization bill before the Senate would expand coverage to reach an additional 3 2 million children  Obama   s remarks  as prepared for delivery  are below     As I   ve traveled across this country over the last few years  there are fewer issues that show a greater disconnect between what the American people want and the way Washington works than health care          Every year people put it at the very top of their list of concerns   Every year more people lose their insurance  or watch their premiums skyrocket  or open up medical bills that they just can   t pay          And yet  whenever the issue actually comes up in Washington  they watch health care debates play out that are filled with half truths and scare tactics   They see insurance companies run ads telling folks they   ll lose their doctor or wait forever if universal health care is passed          They watch the industry spend billions on lobbyists who use undue influence to block much needed reform   And at the end of the day  nothing gets done  and we move on to fight about something else          To most Americans  we seem completely disconnected from the reality that they   re living every day   Especially when we have a President who actually said     I mean  people have access to health care in America   After all  you just go to an emergency room             That   s what passes for universal health care in the greatest  wealthiest country on Earth     overcrowded  understaffed Emergency Rooms that raise everyone   s premiums and cost taxpayers more money          It   s shameful   And what   s even more shameful is that nine million of the Americans who are forced to wait in Emergency Rooms when they get sick     who have no health insurance at all     are children          Children who did not choose where they were born or how much money their parents have   Children whose development depends on the care and nourishment they receive in those early years   Children who any parent  anywhere  should want to protect at any cost          Now  we can shade the truth and pretend there are only one million uninsured like the President says   We can make excuses for this neglect or we can just ignore it altogether  but as long as there are nine million children in the United States of America with no health insurance  it is a betrayal of the ideals we hold as Americans          It   s not who we are  and today is our chance to prove it          We know that CHIP works   Because of CHIP  6 million children who   d otherwise be uninsured have health care today   Because of CHIP  millions of children are protected when their parents lose their health care          Because of CHIP  individual states like my home state of Illinois are building on its success to expand health coverage even further   And because of CHIP  millions of children with asthma  traumatic injuries  and mental health conditions  are able to see a doctor and get the treatment they need           Even though the uninsured rate among low income children fell by more than one third in the years after CHIP was enacted  the trend reversed two years ago   And since then  we   ve seen growing numbers of uninsured children          Uninsured children are twice as likely as insured children to miss out on needed medical care  including doctor visits and checkups          One quarter of uninsured children don   t get any medical care at all   And those who do  get lower quality care   Even with the same illnesses and conditions  whether it   s an ear infection or appendicitis  studies have found that uninsured children get different treatment  and often suffer more as a result   One study even found that uninsured children who are admitted to a hospital with injuries are twice as likely to die there as children who do have insurance          And to put this problem in the larger context  we know that when a child gets sick and can   t get treated     or receives inadequate treatment     he misses more days of school   And when he misses more school days  he begins to do worse relative to his peers   And that can have long term consequences on his chances in life   That   s not something I   d want for either of my two young daughters or for any other American child         So let   s get serious and solve this problem   Let   s reauthorize CHIP   Let   s make sure that the 6 million children who are now covered through the program continue to be covered     and let   s extend coverage to an additional 3 2 million uninsured children         But we also know that the question of children   s health care is tied to the larger question of universal care in this country  Because we know that when we cover parents  we also cover children   And that   s something we   ve seen in Illinois   When I was a State Senator  I was able to help extend health care coverage to an additional 150 000 parents and their children   So if we   re serious about covering every child  we have to cover every parent as well          The American people have been waiting for us to act on health care for far too long   And starting by covering more children should not be a difficult issue to agree on
