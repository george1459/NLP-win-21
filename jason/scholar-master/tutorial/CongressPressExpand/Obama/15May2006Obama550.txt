   Obama Amendment to End No bid Contracts for Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction Passes Senate   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Amendment to End No bid Contracts for Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction Passes Senate Thursday  May  4  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  May 4  2006  Obama Amendment to End No bid Contracts for Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction Passes Senate   WASHINGTON   Legislation requiring competitive bidding for Federal contracts for Gulf Coast reconstruction proposed by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  passed the Senate today by a vote of 78 to 20    Immediately after the hurricane  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  awarded four  100 million no bid contracts to four large companies without full and open competition  Last year  Obama and Senator Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  met with Acting FEMA Director David Paulison and received assurances from him that all no bid contracts would be re bid  In March  FEMA announced that the contracts would not be re bid despite Paulison s previous assurance     The total amount of federal funding for hurricane recovery will now exceed  100 billion  and it s safe to say that more money will be needed in the months and years to come   said Obama   But in order to make good on the President s pledge to rebuild the Gulf Coast  we need to do more  We need to pledge to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars  Unfortunately  we haven t done a very good job so far of delivering on this pledge     Obama s legislation requires that all Federal contracts in excess of  500 000 paid for with funds from the  27 billion allocated to Gulf Coast reconstruction in the emergency supplemental bill be competitively bid    Just two weeks ago  a federal audit found that the Army Corps of Engineers missed an opportunity to negotiate a lower price on a  40 million contract for portable classrooms in Mississippi  Instead  a no bid and overpriced contract was awarded to an out of state firm     I ve often heard it said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again  and expecting different results   Obama said   Frankly  what we re doing with Katrina funding borders on insanity   we in Congress just keep trusting FEMA to enter into competitive contracts even though there s no evidence that it has any intention of doing so  The American people deserve the benefits of competition on government contracts  Before we spend another dollar in the Gulf Coast  let s make sure that we have some transparency and accountability systems in place to ensure that federal money is helping those people most in need  instead of lining the pockets of a contractor     In addition to Senator Coburn  the amendment was also cosponsored by Senators Mary Landrieu  D LA   Ted Kennedy  D MA   and Hillary Clinton  D NY
