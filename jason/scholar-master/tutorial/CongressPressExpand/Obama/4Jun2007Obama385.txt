   Obama Calls for Hearing on Bill to Give Shareholders Vote on Executive Pay   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls for Hearing on Bill to Give Shareholders Vote on Executive Pay Wednesday  May 30  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt       Legislation would boost transparency  spur public debate over rising executive compensation WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee to request that they hold a hearing on the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act  a bill he sponsored that would give shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation and spur both increased transparency and public debate over pay packages   The legislation passed the House by a wide margin in April   The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby  As you may know  in April  I introduced the   which is the companion to a bill that passed the House of Representatives by a 269 134 vote  Since introduction  Senators Harkin  Durbin  Brown  Kerry  and Levin have joined as cosponsors   The legislation was referred to your committee  and I am writing to respectfully request that you hold a hearing on the issue of executive compensation packages  and specifically  the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act  S  1181 would require a nonbinding shareholder vote on executive compensation packages   I believe public discussion and debate over executive compensation packages would force corporate boards to think twice before signing over millions of dollars to CEOs   Certainly  many CEOs are ably steering their firms and deserve their paychecks   But the rate at which executive pay has grown  as compared to stagnating wages among American workers  is rightfully frustrating shareholders and employees alike  especially given the lackluster performance of many of the companies paying these high salaries   In 2005  the average CEO in the United States earned 262 times the pay of the average worker   Put another way  a CEO earned more in one workday than an average worker earned in a year   In 2005  the average CEO of a Standard   Poor   s 500 company received a 16  increase in CEO pay over 2004   S 1181 neither caps nor limits CEO pay but merely requires that firms discuss and debate pay packages for CEOs on a case by case basis with their shareholders   If a board of directors disagrees with the nonbinding vote of shareholders  the board can still go forward with the pay package   But at the very least  shareholders would have had the opportunity to voice their opinions about whether the pay package is appropriate   Thank you for your consideration and for your leadership in this area   I look forward to working with you on this and other legislation important to America   s economy     Sincerely      Barack Obama   United States Senator
