   Obama Statement on Veterans    Affairs Committee Hearing on Marion VA Hospital   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Statement on Veterans    Affairs Committee Hearing on Marion VA Hospital Tuesday  November  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  Contact  Amy Brundage  202 615 9467 WASHINGTON  DC    Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  submitted the following statement for the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee hearing on  Hiring Practices and Quality Control in VA Medical Facilities   He specifically addressed the issue at the Marion  Illinois VA Medical Center  which saw an increased number of patient deaths over the last months and was found to have employed a surgeon who had been barred from practicing in another state  Obama  along with Senator Dick Durbin  has repeatedly pressed the VA for information on the situation in Marion  The senators sent a letter to Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gordon Mansfield asking additional questions that were raised by the VA   s response  in regard to the unexpected deaths  other patient safety events and the credentialing process for VA doctors   Previously  the senators wrote outgoing Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson asking specific questions about the VA s response to the increase in deaths at the center   They also asked why Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  and asked about the background check performed before he was hired   This followed a previous letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation   Obama has also joined Durbin in calling on the U S  Attorney s office to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing at the Marion VA   Below is Senator Obama s statement to the Committee  which is submitted for the hearing record   Senator Durbin and I have worked to get to the bottom of what went wrong at the Marion facility     and many questions still remain   We will keep fighting for answers  not only for our veterans and those families who have lost a loved one  but for all who have been affected by this loss   That is part of keeping our sacred trust to these true American heroes     While some may argue that the problems at Marion were isolated  I have serious concerns that medical errors  including fatal errors  may have occurred because of more systemic failings in the VA s quality safeguards   GAO testimony about weak internal controls over privileging and physicians practicing with expired privileges in at least one VA facility strongly suggest that this problem may be more widespread   We have asked important questions about the VA s medical credentialing and privileging process  and I hope that Dr  Cross  the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health  can provide evidence today as to whether the VA views its current process as adequate   If not  he owes us answers about what he is doing today to improve the process   We also need to address the VA s quality measurement tracking system   The data analysis that flagged the spike in unexpected deaths at the Marion facility     which was part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program  NSQIP      triggered action almost six months after the period in which that death rate was observed    When we are talking about the quality of care and safety of our veterans  we cannot wait six months to be alerted to and start investigating a tragedy like this one   We must have safeguards that would flag any problems much more quickly and accurately    Furthermore  we still have not yet been able to confirm how many of the deaths from April     September 2007 were unexpected at the Marion VA  and I urge Dr  Cross to provide that answer today   This is an important question because doctors who have since been dismissed were still authorized to operate during this time period   Last week  allegations of serious misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing were presented to my office by a group of current and former VA employees   These allegations must be thoroughly investigated  not only by the Office of the Inspector General  but by the U S  Attorney s Office   If true  they reinforce the failure in oversight from the VA Health Administration of facilities across the country   When VA employees seek to report a medical error or a problem with the management  they must have protected avenues to do so   The majority of VA health staff perform their jobs with exceptional competence and compassion on a daily basis   They do not have an easy job   And they are the first to agree that our veterans deserve world class medical care   So today  the VA must show us how they will put air tight quality controls in place to anticipate and catch problems before they turn into tragedies                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
