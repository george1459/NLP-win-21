                 Harkin  Hagel  Obama Take Action to Prevent Suicide Among Active Duty Soldiers Thursday  January 31  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Jennifer Mullin  Harkin    Jordan Stark  Hagel   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Washington Post reports today on record number of soldier suicides last year   highest rate since 1990 Washington  D C    As news reports reveal growing numbers of suicide among soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Iraq  U S  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced major legislation aimed at preventing suicide among active duty members of the military  The Senators  bill  the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act  would direct the Department of Defense  DoD  to create a comprehensive suicide prevention program including annual training for soldiers  improved instruction for field medics and post deployment assistance  The legislation authorizes six million dollars for implementation of the programs  A companion measure will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Leonard Boswell  D IA   Today s Washington Post reported that Army statistics show that 121 soldiers committee suicide last year   a 20 percent increase from 2006  This is the highest rate of Army suicides recorded since the Army started collecting this data in 1980  The Post also reported that last year about 2 100 soldiers  injured themselves or attempted suicide  compared with about 350 in 2002    These startling statistics should serve as a wakeup call that suicide among soldiers and veterans is more than a problem  it is an epidemic   said Senator Harkin   Thankfully  our push to provide America s veterans with a suicide prevention program was heard last year  when the President signed the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act into law  But there is more work ahead   especially in serving our active duty military personnel  We can and must act quickly to save our soldiers who are so bravely fighting for our country     Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there has been a significant increase in suicides among active duty soldiers   This is a reality our country must face as we are engaged in two conflicts   This legislation will enhance and strengthen the Defense Department s suicide prevention programs for all active duty military personnel   It is critical for our service members to be provided with the necessary mental health services they deserve   There can be no higher priority for America than our soldiers and their families   said Senator Hagel   Our nation s heroes deserve our greatest support and commitment  and we must immediately address the tragic increase in suicide rates among our active duty service members   said Senator Obama   The men and women who serve our country should expect nothing less than world class medical care  treatment  rehabilitation  and counseling services   Suicide can be prevented  and we must do everything we can to help those who are suffering   This bill will help ensure there are comprehensive suicide prevention programs throughout the military  and I commend Senator Harkin s leadership on this needed legislation   Specifically  the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act will   Conduct a service wide mental health campaign to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues  encourage people to seek help when needed  and increase awareness that mental health is essential to overall health and that treatments can promote recovery from mental illness   The campaign should raise awareness about assistance for substance abuse issues  as well as relationship and financial difficulties   An outreach campaign should also focus health professionals both on and off military installations to raise awareness of the health needs of returning military personnel    Implement annual suicide prevention training of all active duty  Reserve  and National Guard members and involve military leadership in outreach efforts by incorporating suicide prevention training in officer and senior enlisted training courses    Strengthen basic lifesaver training and training for military medics and medical personnel to incorporate recognition of risk factors for suicide  identification of signs and symptoms of mental health issues  and protocols for responding to crisis situations involving members of the Armed Forces who may be at high risk for suicide     Utilize crisis response teams within units to prevent and respond to traumatic events   Such teams will consist of key personnel such as medical staff  chaplains  family support staff  and peers      Provide post deployment follow up and assistance for family members and peers of members of the Armed Services on mental health problems  substance use  and financial and relationship difficulties  including information on resources to address these issues       Provides resources to the Department of Defense to examine innovative and effective strategies to recruit qualified uniformed mental health professionals    Provides resources to the Department of Defense to examine innovative and effective ways to fight the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment    Late last year  Harkin s push for the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to provide a comprehensive suicide prevention program for returning soldiers became a reality through the enactment of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Action   named after Joshua Omvig  a soldier from Grundy Center who took his own life after returning from Iraq  Harkin s legislation directs the VA to integrate mental health services into veterans  primary care  and step up counseling and other mental health services for returning war veterans                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60
