the first day of the new Congress  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph R  Biden Jr   D DE  and Byron L  Dorgan  D ND  introduced legislation that will increase American drivers  access to ethanol at fuel pumps  Currently  the United States imports more than 60 percent of its oil  and our consumption continues to increase   further subjecting consumers to the whims of the world oil market  Over sixty percent of the world s oil reserves are held in the Middle East  handcuffing our foreign policy    American drivers can help reverse our oil dependence by filling up with ethanol blends like E85  85  ethanol  15  gas  or biodiesel  Increasing the use of ethanol will reduce our oil consumption and give us an environmentally friendly  domestically produced source of fuel   Today  Sens  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  Dorgan and Obama offered legislation  titled the BioFuels Security Act  to increase renewable fuels use through higher renewable fuels standards  RFS   greater availability of ethanol pumps and increased production of cars equipped to run on alternative fuel sources   The Renewable Fuels Standard is one of the most significant steps taken by Congress to increase ethanol production and decrease our nation s dangerous dependence on foreign oil   Senator Obama said   We should build off this success by increasing ethanol production  consumer access to renewable fuels  and the production of cars and trucks that can use them  It s time for Congress to realize what farmers in America s heartland have known all along   that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel  but what we ve been lacking is the political will       For too long  we ve depended on importing oil to meet our energy needs   Senator Harkin said   This legislation lays the roadmap to a long term ramp up in domestically produced renewable fuels  I believe if we are to attain national and economic security for our nation  we can and we must achieve these aggressive goals       I am pleased to join Senator Tom Harkin in re introducing the Biofuels Security Act in the 110th Congress  Our nation must take seriously our future energy security  and I am hopeful that this Congress will consider the merits of this aggressive  yet prudent  bi partisan legislation   Senator Lugar said     If it was not clear before  it is now   domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Biden   For our own security   both nationally and globally    we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with increased use of alternative  home grown fuels   We have no choice but to get smarter with our energy policy      We must work towards requiring more use of ethanol and significant long term investment in renewable fuels to lead to a decrease of our nation s dependence on foreign sources of oil   said Senator Dorgan   This increase in ethanol production will expand job growth in the U S      The Renewable Fuels Standard is one of the most significant steps taken by Congress to increase ethanol production and decrease our nation s dangerous dependence on foreign oil   Senator Obama said   We should build off this success by increasing ethanol production  consumer access to renewable fuels  and the production of cars and trucks that can use them  It s time for Congress to realize what farmers in America s heartland have known all along   that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel  but what we ve been lacking is the political will     Specifically  the bill  Proposes a new renewable fuels standard  RFS  that calls for 60 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be included in the United States motor vehicle fuel supply annually by the year 2030 by boosting ethanol and biodiesel production to 30 billion gallons annually by 2020  and then doubling that quantity over the following ten years to 60 billion gallons by 2030   Calls for increasing the number of gasoline stations that carry blends of 85  ethanol  E85   The bill would require large oil companies to install E85 pumps at their stations  increasing by five percentage points annually over the next 10 years  resulting in approximately 50  percent of all major brand gasoline stations nationwide having E85 pumps available within a decade   Directs automakers to gradually increase flex fuel vehicle  FFV  production  increasing in ten percentage point increments annually  until nearly all vehicles sold in the U S  are FFV s within 10 years  Currently  flex fuel vehicles    those able to use both regular gasoline and blends of up to 85 percent ethanol  E85    make up only about two percent of vehicles on the road
