   Obama Demands Answers on Blackwater Immunity Deal   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Obama Demands Answers on Blackwater Immunity Deal Tuesday  October 30  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                               Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC   Today  United States Senator Barack Obama  D IL  sent the following letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice demanding answers on reports that State Department officials offered Blackwater guards immunity from prosecution  which may hinder a criminal investigation into the September shooting that killed at least 17 Iraqis    Obama has introduced legislation in the Senate to make private security contractors in Iraq subject to federal criminal law  this bill has already passed the House  Obama has also called for the head of Blackwater to testify before the Senate  In February  Obama introduced comprehensive legislation to increase oversight on private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  part of his legislation requiring reporting to Congress on the role of contractors passed the Senate last month     Below is a copy of the letter  Dear Secretary Rice  I am deeply troubled by news reports that the State Department promised guards employed by Blackwater USA immunity from prosecution as part of the Department s initial investigation into the September 16 shooting of 17 Iraqi civilians   The seriousness of this incident   and its effect on the American military s reputation in Iraq   necessitates the prosecution of the appropriate Blackwater personnel if they are found to have committed crimes   However  a full investigation and prosecution will be difficult when all of the Blackwater guards   both in the vehicle convoy involved in the shooting and the helicopters above   were apparently given immunity by investigators from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security  an arm of the State Department   According to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said   Once you give immunity  you can t take it away    Although this matter has now been turned over from the State Department to the FBI  prosecutors will have to prove that any evidence they use in bringing charges against Blackwater guards was uncovered independently without using the guards  statements to Bureau of Diplomatic Security investigators   As any prosecutor knows  this is not impossible  but it is extremely difficult   Because the decision to give immunity to Blackwater guards was a serious one and may potentially jeopardize any prosecution of those involved  I ask that you respond to the following questions   1  Were you aware of the decision to provide immunity to Blackwater guards   If not  who made this decision  2  Was the FBI or the Justice Department consulted before immunity was provided to Blackwater guards   3  Do you agree with the decision to provide immunity to Blackwater guards  I ask you to provide responses to these questions by November 6  2007   Thank you  Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator                               Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
