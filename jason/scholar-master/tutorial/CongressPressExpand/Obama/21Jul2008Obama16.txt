                                  Appropriations Committee Approves Obama  Hagel  Durbin Request for Additional Support for IAEA Monday  July 21  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT Michael Ortiz  Obama   Jordan Stark  Hagel   or Max Gleischman  Durbin   16 million increase would bolster IAEA s efforts to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today applauded the Senate Appropriations Committee for agreeing to increase support for the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  by  16 million  In March  the senators called for an increase of  10 million for the IAEA to improve its ability to keep nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands by bolstering its analytic capability and its efforts to help countries to secure nuclear material  An increase in support for the IAEA is one of a broad set of measures called for in a bill introduced last year by Obama and Hagel to sustain U S  leadership in a cooperative global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism  reduce global nuclear arsenals  and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology   Keeping nuclear weapons and material out of the hands of terrorists and rogue states is a vital national security priority   said Senator Obama   We need to build and sustain a truly global effort  including providing ample resources for the world s nuclear watchdog agency  to ensure that stockpiles of nuclear material are secure and to prevent additional countries from acquiring nuclear weapons   I applaud the Senate Appropriations Committee for its decision to provide additional support to the IAEA to help keep the world s most dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands    It is in every nation s interest to strengthen the IAEA s capability to promote nuclear nonproliferation   These additional funds will expand and accelerate the IAEA s efforts to assist countries with securing nuclear materials while helping upgrade technical analysis of samples obtained during inspections   Sustained engagement with our international partners on nuclear nonproliferation will be required to address one of the great challenges of the 21st century   said U S  Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE    Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is vital to our national security and global stability   Durbin said   These funds will ensure that the agency charged with checking the spread of nuclear weapons and weapon components  the International Atomic Energy Agency  has the tools and resources to continue this important work  It s not just in our nation s best interest that IAEA is able to fulfill its mission   it s a global imperative   The text of the March 28  2008 letter is below  March 28  2008 The Honorable Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Subcommittee on  State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs  Senate Committee on Appropriations  Washington  DC  20510 The Honorable Judd Gregg  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on  State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs  Senate Committee on Appropriations   Washington  DC  20510 Dear Mr  Chairman and Senator Gregg  We respectfully request that you increase the FY2009 budget for Nonproliferation  Anti terrorism  Demining and Related Programs  NADR  to provide an additional  10 million for voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  to improve its ability to keep nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands by bolstering its analytic capability and its efforts to help countries to secure nuclear material   We know Al Qaeda has made it a goal to acquire a nuclear weapon  If a sophisticated terrorist group obtained the right amount of plutonium or highly enriched uranium  it could potentially construct a crude nuclear device that could destroy the heart of any major city in the United States  While significant progress has been made in securing nuclear materials  there are still large stockpiles that remain vulnerable to theft  The IAEA plays an important role in keeping nuclear materials out of the wrong hands by providing international guidelines for improving security and assisting countries with implementation of these guidelines  Yet the IAEA s efforts in this area are chronically constrained by a small budget and an undersized staff  Increasing the voluntary contribution for nuclear security by  5 million in FY2009 would enable the IAEA to expand and accelerate its critical efforts to help secure nuclear materials  The IAEA also plays a key role in international nonproliferation efforts by conducting inspections of nuclear facilities to ensure that nuclear material is not being diverted for military purposes  The other  5 million of the additional funding should be used to strengthen the capabilities of the IAEA s Safeguards Analytical Laboratory  which provides technical analysis of samples obtained during inspections  The laboratory s infrastructure is aging and the additional funding would play an important role in upgrading the laboratory so it can meet future requirements  We believe that the additional funding for the IAEA represents a sound investment in enhancing our national security  The U S  contribution to the IAEA was included in the highest rating category for effectiveness in a review of government programs conducted by the U S  Office of Management and Budget due to substantial progress in achieving sound long term goals  Thank you for your consideration of this request  Sincerely  Barack Obama                                                                           Chuck Hagel  Richard Durbin                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
