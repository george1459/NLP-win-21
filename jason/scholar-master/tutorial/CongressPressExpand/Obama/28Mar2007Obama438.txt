   Obama Opposes Effort to Keep U S  Troops in Iraq Indefinitely   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Opposes Effort to Keep U S  Troops in Iraq Indefinitely Tuesday  March 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Announces his opposition to amendment removing redeployment dates from supplemental  WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on an amendment that would remove the deadlines for redeploying U S  troops from Iraq from the supplemental appropriations bill   Obama is the sponsor of the Iraq De escalation Act  which sets March 31  2008 as the target date for redeploying U S  combat brigades from Iraq  the same target date as a provision in the supplemental   Senator Obama   s statement  submitted for the record  is below    We gather on another occasion to bring the Iraq War to its fateful end   While this effort may fall short again  we will continue to try to do what is in the national security of our country   The Iraq War should never have been authorized   I was proud to say so in 2002  but I am even more proud of the plan I have offered that calls for combat to begin redeploying on May 1st with the goal of all combat troops out of Iraq by March 2008   We also must make sure that we   re not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in  and that   s why this withdrawal should be gradual  and keep some U S  troops in the region to prevent a wider war in the region and go after Al Qaeda and other terrorists   Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people   But the American people have been extraordinarily resolved   They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah  They have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort     money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation   No  it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos  but a failure of strategy     a strategy that has only strengthened Iran   s strategic position  increased threats posed by terrorist organizations  reduced U S  credibility and influence around the world  and placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in the region in greater peril   Iraq has been a failure of strategy and that strategy must change   It is time to bring a responsible end to this conflict because there is no military solution to this war   Before we send our best off to battle in the future  we must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow   We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy   We must not embark on war based on untested theories  political agendas or wishful thinking that have little basis in fact or reality   We must focus our efforts on the threats we know exist  and we must evaluate those threats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political reasons again   We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense   It is a choice we sometimes have to make  but one that must be made rarely and always reluctantly   We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war   Iraq was not just a failure of conception  but a failure of execution  and so when a conflict does arise that requires our involvement  we must try to understand that country   s history  its politics  its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil   We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does automatically create a democracy   Real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force  and a legitimate government  and ensuring that people have food  and water  and electricity  and basic services   And we must be honest about how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people themselves  And finally  we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women to war  we make sure we   ve given them the training they need  and the equipment that will keep them safe  and a mission they can accomplish   And when our troops come home  it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they come home to the services  and the benefits  and the care they deserve  The cause to defend our country and our interests around the world will never end   It will be one of country   s constant threads through the ages  It is our sacred trust to ensure that those moments  those times of great struggle  are the right ones   And when they are not  we must continue to try and end those conflicts for the sake of our country our service men and women and the ideals we hold dear   For these reasons  I strongly support the provision in the supplemental bill that calls for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 31  2008  and I will oppose any efforts to strip that provision from the bill
