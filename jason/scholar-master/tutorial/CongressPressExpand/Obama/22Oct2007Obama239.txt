   Obama Statement on the Appointment of Dr  Susan Orr as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at HHS   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Statement on the Appointment of Dr  Susan Orr as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at HHS Monday  October 22  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Amy Brundage  Obama     I have serious concerns about the Bush Administration s appointment of Dr  Susan Orr to oversee family planning programs and Title X funding at the Department of Health and Human Services  Her troubling history of opposing federal funding for these programs threatens the right of women and families to access these important resources  Family planning programs serve millions of low income Americans annually and provide affordable and accessible reproductive health services  The American people deserve to have a qualified public health expert overseeing and upholding these programs  Dr  Orr s appointment shows that even when it comes to public health  this Administration will put its own interests above the people s interests   I strongly oppose her appointment
