                      Obama Criticizes VA Decision to Review 72 000 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Cases Wednesday  August 10  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 10  2005  Obama Criticizes VA Decision to Review 72 000 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Cases VA Review Only Includes Vets Awarded Full Benefits  not Those Denied   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Veterans  Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today criticized the VA s decision to review more than 70 000 cases where veterans were awarded full benefits for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  cases  while not reviewing any cases where veterans may have been denied benefits they earned     In order to truly create fairness in the claims system  the VA should concentrate its efforts on reviewing denials of PTSD claims   said Obama   Without assessing why some PTSD claims are denied  it will be impossible to fully understand how the VA s PTSD rating system can be improved     According to recent news reports  the VA will review 72 000 cases in which the maximum amount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded because of the VA s belief that 2 5  of these cases are  potentially fraudulent   Obama said this review is long and stressful  and that veterans should not be forced to unnecessarily prove their cases again     The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time consuming   said Obama   It requires the compilation of medical records  military service records  and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person s combat exposure  I cannot fathom why VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally painful process for a second time     Previously  the VA considered adopting a policy that required any new case where a veteran is awarded service connected PTSD benefits to be reviewed by two raters  Senator Obama raised his objections with this policy in a letter dated June 21  2005  The policy was later discarded  Obama said the VA should create uniform standards for evaluating PTSD claims     The VA   and our nation s veterans   would be better served by creating nationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims   said Obama   As the Inspector General s report underscored  PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to significant variation  The variation in PTSD ratings across the country may well be the result of a lack of training or standardized practices on the part of the VA  instead of fraud on the part of our nation s veterans      In December  Senator Obama learned that Illinois veterans have received disproportionately less disability pay  on average  than veterans in 49 of the 52 states and territories for the past two decades  Obama asked the VA to issue a report detailing how this disparity occurred  which found that  variance in 100 percent PTSD cases is a primary factor contributing to the variance in average annual compensation by state   For example  New Mexico has the highest payment average of  12 004  and 12 6 percent of its veterans are in this group  Illinois has the lowest average payment of  6 961 and only 2 8 percent of its compensation recipients are rated 100 percent for PTSD     The Senate VA committee recently passed the Veterans  Benefits Improvement Act of 2005  which included an amendment offered by Senator Obama to require the VA to standardize the assessment of PTSD claims     August 10  2005   The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20420   Dear Secretary Nicholson                I am writing to express my serious concerns about recent news reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  is reviewing 72 000 post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  cases between 1999 and 2004 in which veterans received the maximum amount of disability benefits   This appears to be yet another attempt by the Bush Administration to put roadblocks in front of veterans who are trying to obtain the benefits they earned and deserve                I first raised this issue with you in a letter dated June 21  2005   In that letter  I strongly objected to a VA proposal to require a concurring second signature for PTSD cases in which benefits were granted   I was concerned that the VA had no similar plans to examine whether veterans were being unfairly denied PTSD claims and was only interested in determining whether some veterans were getting too much money   While I recognize the budgetary crisis that the VA is facing  it is wrong for the VA to ignore the possibility that many veterans have been unjustly denied their earned benefits                      In your response to my letter dated July 6  2005  you indicated that VA would not pursue the proposed second signature policy   I was pleased with the change in policy  but I am disturbed that the VA has now chosen to ignore my initial concerns                 According to an August 9  2005  article in Salon  the VA will review 72 000 cases in which the maximum amount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded because of VA s belief that 2 5  of these cases are  potentially fraudulent     It is inherently unfair to review only cases in which PTSD benefits were granted while ignoring cases in which benefits were denied                 Equally troubling is the message that such a mandatory review of PTSD claims sends to the brave men and women who defended this country   Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy with the singular goal of denying services and benefits to veterans   This recent decision to reopen granted PTSD claims merely serves to promote that impression   It is unconscionable for our government to put the onus on law abiding veterans to affirmatively demonstrate that they are not engaging in fraud   The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time consuming   It requires the compilation of medical records  military service records  and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person s combat exposure   I cannot fathom why VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally painful process for a second time       The VA   and our nation s veterans   would be better served by creating nationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims   As the Inspector General s report underscored  PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to significant variation   The variation in PTSD ratings across the country may well be the result of a lack of training or standardized practices on the part of the VA  instead of fraud on the part of our nation s veterans     In order to truly create fairness in the claims system  the VA should concentrate its efforts on reviewing denials of PTSD claims   Without assessing why some PTSD claims are denied  it will be impossible to fully understand how the VA s PTSD rating system can be improved   In any event  any analysis of PTSD claims should not require veterans to readjudicate their claims   The veterans  disability benefits process is already long and arduous   Forcing our nation s veterans to renavigate the system is not only impractical  but it is unfair    I call on you once again to disavow VA s proposal to reopen claims of veterans who have received PTSD disability benefits    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
