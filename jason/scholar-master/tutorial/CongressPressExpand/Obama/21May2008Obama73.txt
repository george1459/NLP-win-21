   Obama and Honda Introduce STEM Act to Improve Science and Technology Education in Our Nation s Schools   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama and Honda Introduce STEM Act to Improve Science and Technology Education in Our Nation s Schools Wednesday  May 21  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Jos   Dante Parra  Honda  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Bill will strengthen federal agency education programs in the STEM fields WASHINGTON  D C    Rep  Mike Honda and Sen  Barack Obama today introduced a bipartisan bill in their respective chambers that will make America s students and future labor force more competitive in science related fields  The bill was introduced at a time when other countries are gaining ground on America in science and technology fields  Obama  D IL  and Honda  D CA  said this bill will help develop a coordinated strategy in the teaching of science  technology  engineering and math education  the fields collectively known as STEM  The  Enhancing Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics Education Act of 2008   H R  6104  will create mechanisms for federal agencies and the states to coordinate STEM education strategies   We need to focus our efforts in teaching the scientists and engineers of tomorrow   said Honda  a former science teacher and educator of more than 30 years   Federal agencies unfortunately are not communicating among themselves  Current federal efforts in STEM education are neither coordinated  nor coherent  nor cooperative  This bill will create the mechanisms and venue for cooperative relationships to develop    We must ensure our nation remains a global leader in scientific advancement and technological innovation  and that begins with strengthening America s schools   said Obama    Our students deserve the education and skills they need to compete in today s global economy and to understand the increasingly complex issues that face our democracy  and we must do everything we can to provide them with the resources and curriculum they need to succeed   This critical legislation will help students develop critical thinking and effective problem solving skills in science  technology  engineering and mathematics by coordinating federal STEM education efforts  consolidating federal education initiatives  and supporting states in collaboratively organizing their efforts   I am proud to introduce this legislation with Congressman Honda  and look forward to moving it forward in Congress    Among the bill s original co sponsors are Rep  George Miller  chairman of the House Committee on Labor and Education  Rep  Vernon Ehlers  R MI   and Rep  Rush Holt  D NJ    In 2006  the federal government sponsored 105 STEM education programs through 15 different federal agencies at a cost of  3 12 billion  Yet the following year  American students did poorly in a test offered world wide that measures student proficiency in understanding and applying science  Microsoft s Bill Gates summarized the concerns when he said   When I compare our high schools with what I see when I m traveling abroad  I m terrified for our workforce of tomorrow   Honda s and Obama s bill would   Reorganize the President s Office of Science and Technology Policy  OSTP   OSTP has a STEM subcommittee that has remained largely dormant over the past few years  The bill would raise that subcommittee to a committee level  giving it a mandate to work proactively at designing coherent STEM strategies  Create an Office of STEM at the U S  Department of Education at the assistant secretary level  This office will coordinate STEM education initiatives among all federal agencies and have a seat at the OSTP STEM Committee  Institute a voluntary Consortium on STEM education  The Consortium would be integrated by no less than five states representing at least five of the nation s nine geographical regions  Its mission is to develop common content standards for K 12 STEM education  engineered at the state and local levels  Create the National STEM Education Research Repository  This would be a clearing house for educators to research the latest innovations in STEM  This will break the silos that keep creative programs from being replicated    Our nation s competitiveness in the global economy depends largely on our ability to graduate students who excel in the fields of science  technology  engineering and math   Ehlers said   We must do all that we can as a nation to prepare students at every grade level so that they have a genuine interest and demonstrated skills in these fields  The jobs of tomorrow will require STEM education skills and our next generation of innovators will need them to succeed   For educators  this bill promises to create tools and make available resources that are now scattered and isolated among federal agencies and the states   The Enhancing Science  Technology  Engineering  and Math Education Act of 2008 will coordinate and enhance STEM education programs at the federal level and empower states to better address the critical needs in their STEM education systems   said Gerald Wheeler  Executive Director of the National Science Teachers Association   We are pleased to support this legislation    As the American economy attempts to recover from a deep economic downturn  losing sight of long term strategies to manage the economy can be risky  said Rep  Rush Holt    Scientists and educators should not be the only ones concerned about STEM education  Those who care about our long term economic health and the ability of future generations to compete in a new global economy should be concerned   Holt said   This legislation is part of our strategy to get STEM education back on track at a time when we can no longer afford to lose ground to our competitors                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
