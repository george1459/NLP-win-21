   Key Report Highlights Advantages of Insuring Adults   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Key Report Highlights Advantages of Insuring Adults Wednesday  May 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jude McCartin  Bingaman  202 224 1804 WASHINGTON     A dozen Senators today said they would fight to ensure states are allowed to keep the flexibility to cover adults through the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  when that program is reauthorized later this year   Citing a report by the respected Kaiser Family Foundation  the Senators pointed out that SCHIP coverage of parents leads to improved healthcare coverage of children   It also plays an important role in filling a coverage gap for adults and pregnant women who otherwise would not have access to insurance    Eleven states have received waivers to cover adults through SCHIP and or Medicaid  Minnesota  Rhode Island  Arizona  Illinois  New Jersey  Wisconsin  Arkansas  Idaho  Nevada  New Mexico and Oregon    Senator Barack Obama     SCHIP   s expansion to cover Illinois parents has allowed 55 000 more children to gain access to health care coverage   We know what works in Illinois  and we must guarantee continued state flexibility as we reauthorize SCHIP to ensure families can keep their health insurance coverage   Repealing adult coverage could cause over 200 000 Illinois parents to lose their coverage and have a ripple effect on coverage for children    Senator Jeff Bingaman     More than 45 million Americans already lack health insurance   Any actions we take in re writing SCHIP should reduce that number  not add to it   SCHIP has always been about flexibility  and it would be a mistake for the federal government to tell my state it can   t cover adults     Bingaman is a member of the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   Senator Richard Durbin     When parents are covered  they are more likely to enroll their children in a health insurance plan   Illinois is one of eleven states that offer parents health coverage under SCHIP  and our state has seen an increase in the number of children covered   Allowing other states to do what Illinois has done is one of the best ways to ensure we provide quality health care to the nine million uninsured children in America      Senator Russ Feingold     SCHIP is critical to thousands of adults enrolled in BadgerCare  Wisconsin   s program to provide health care coverage for uninsured families   Eliminating adult coverage would hurt tens of thousands of expectant mothers and parents of children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP      Senator Amy Klobuchar     This is yet another example of states leading the way on crucial issues and the federal government playing catch up  States shouldn   t be penalized for successfully lowering the number of uninsured children and adults and the SCHIP Reauthorization bill should maintain the state   s flexibility to expand coverage to uninsured people      Senator Herb Kohl     Wisconsin   s program  BadgerCare  has used the SCHIP funds to extend coverage to hundreds of thousands of children and parents since 1997  Currently  our state   s program serves over 66 000 individuals and has won praise from policy makers and beneficiaries alike for its efficiency and ease of use  That is why we need to work in a bipartisan matter to reauthorize SCHIP  before it expires at the end of September      Senator Blanche Lincoln  a member of the Senate Finance Committee     Along with Medicaid  SCHIP has served an invaluable role in reducing the ranks of our nation   s uninsured   While covering the millions of children who remain uninsured should be our top priority  we also have to recognize that state flexibility in covering adult populations can be very beneficial   For example  expanding SCHIP coverage to pregnant women can significantly improve the health of hundreds of thousands of infants born each year  and expanding coverage to parents not only serves to cover additional insured individuals  but also increases the likelihood that they will take the steps necessary to enroll their children      Senator Robert Menendez     I have seen ample evidence in my home state of New Jersey of the importance of SCHIP coverage     not only for some of our neediest children  but for their parents as well  As coverage for parents increases  so does coverage for children  We will continue to fight in the Senate to maintain SCHIP coverage for adults so that many in our country who need health care the most are able to get it      Senator Mark Pryor    Federal dollars from SCHIP can help bridge critical health care services to low income workers   Arkansas has made an important effort to improve access to health care for working adults  and I want to make sure my state continues to have the flexibility to address the problem of the uninsured      Senator Harry Reid     All the evidence demonstrates that through covering parents  we are better able to reach the children who are eligible but not enrolled in the program   It is a sad fact that there are currently 6 million children who are not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid even though they are eligible for one of those programs   Reaching out to parents helps us reach and cover those children      Senator Ken Salazar        Right now  Colorado   s CHIP program  CHP   not only covers more than 50 000 kids  but also provides 1 300 pregnant women with pre natal care that promotes the health and well being of infants and saves scarce resources by preventing premature births as well as infant and childhood illnesses and disabilities  This is a good example of the kind of flexibility that states can pursue under CHIP    My staff and I recently held meetings across Colorado with local health care professionals on the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  they all agree that SCHIP and programs like it are largely successful in helping cover children  and we need to build on these successes with insight and ideas from other states       Senator Sheldon Whitehouse     Thousands of Rhode Islanders have health insurance thanks to RIteCare and the federal SCHIP funds that support it   With tens of millions of Americans lacking health coverage  it doesn   t make sense to deny these families the care they depend on as they   re struggling to stay afloat    I applaud Senator Jack Reed   s strong leadership on this issue and will be proud to join him to fight to ensure this program has the flexibility it needs     Whitehouse is a cosponsor of legislation offered by Senators John Rockefeller  D W V   and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  that would support SCHIP   s flexibility in offering coverage to adults
