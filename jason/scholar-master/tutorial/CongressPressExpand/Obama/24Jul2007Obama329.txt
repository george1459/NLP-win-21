   Obama Statement on the Increase in the Minimum Wage   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on the Increase in the Minimum Wage Tuesday  July 24  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on today   s increase in the federal minimum wage     Today  America   s lowest paid workers will receive their first raise in ten years   This increase was long overdue   We stood up to corporate special interests that wanted to deny hard working Americans the basic dignity of a small increase in pay   Americans are rightly cynical about a Congress that fails to increase pay at the bottom of the wage ladder even as it raises its own pay and cuts taxes for the wealthy          I will work to make sure Washington represents the national interest instead of the special interests  Collective bargaining and the right to organize should be guaranteed for every working American  And we must tie future increases in the minimum wage to inflation so that it grows along with the costs those workers face  We need to make the minimum wage a living wage that helps American families not just survive  but succeed
