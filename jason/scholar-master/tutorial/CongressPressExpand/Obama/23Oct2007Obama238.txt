   Obama  FCC Policies Must Encourage Media Ownership Diversity   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  FCC Policies Must Encourage Media Ownership Diversity Monday  October 22  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 FCC Rule Changes Must First Assess and Address Minority Media Ownership WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Federal Communications Commission  FCC  Chairman Kevin J  Martin  calling on him to launch an independent review panel to develop proposals to further promote media ownership diversity   According to press accounts  following an insufficient 30 day review  the FCC intends to modify existing ownership rules by allowing greater media market consolidation   This would allow large media outlets to become larger  potentially cutting out small business  women and minority owned firms   Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play an important role in the African American and Latino communities and help bring minority issues to the forefront of our national dialogue   However  the Commission has failed to recognize the vital role these outlets play in our democracy and has not done enough to further the goals of diversity in the media  In the letter  Obama also asks for the FCC to reconsider the Chairman   s proposed consolidation timeline and start a public review of any specific proposed rule modifications   He also asks Martin to complete a study of the responsibilities that broadcasters have to the communities in which they operate   Obama and Senator John Kerry have previously written to Kevin Martin asking him to address the issue of minority media ownership  and the impact that new rules would have on opportunities for minority  small business  and women owned firms   The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Martin    I am writing regarding your proposal to move forward aggressively with modifications to existing media ownership rules   According to press accounts  you intend to present specific changes to existing rules in November with a Commission vote on that proposal     whatever it may be     on December 18  2007   I believe both the proposed timeline and process are irresponsible    Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play a critical role in the African American and Latino communities and bring minority issues to the forefront of our national discussion   However  the Commission has failed to further the goals of diversity in the media and promote localism  and as a result  it is in no position to justify allowing for increased consolidation of the market   Moreover  30 days of public review of a specific proposed change is insufficient to assess the effect that change would have on the media marketplace or the rationale on which any such proposal is based   While the FCC did commission two studies on minority ownership in the round of 10 studies it ordered at the beginning of 2007  both suffered from the same problem     inadequate data from which to make determinations on the status of minority media ownership or the causes for that status and ways to increase representation    It is time to put together an independent panel  as Commissioner Adelstein has recommended  to issue a specific proposal for furthering the goal of diversity in media ownership   I object to the agency moving forward to allow greater consolidation in the media market without first fully understanding how that would limit opportunities for minority  small business  and women owned firms  I also object to the Commission   s propensity to vet proposals through leaks to the press and lobbyists   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  issued a report in September 2007 titled     The FCC Should Take Steps to Ensure Equal Access to Rulemaking Information      In that report  GAO found that      Situations where some  but not all  stakeholders know what the FCC is considering for an upcoming vote undermine fairness and transparency of the process and constitute a violation of the FCC   s rules      The report went on to state      This imbalance of information is not the intended result of the Communications Act and it runs contrary to the principles of transparency and equal opportunity for participation established by law and to the FCC   s own rules that govern rulemaking     In the wake of that report  I find it disturbing that  according to the New York Times  the Commission is considering repealing the newspaper and television cross ownership rules   It is unclear what your intent is on the rest of the media ownership regulations   Repealing the cross ownership rules and retaining the rest of our existing regulations is not a proposal that has been put out for public comment  the proper process for vetting it is not in closed door meetings with lobbyists or in selective leaks to the New York Times    Although such a proposal may pass the muster of a federal court  Congress and the public have the right to review any specific proposal and decide whether or not it constitutes sound policy   And the Commission has the responsibility to defend any new proposal in public discourse and debate    This is not the first time I have communicated with the agency on this matter   Senator Kerry and I wrote to you on July 20  2006  stating that the Commission needed to address and complete a proceeding on issues of minority and small business media ownership before taking up the wider media ownership rules   Our request echoed an amendment adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee in June 2006   And last month  at an FCC hearing on media ownership held in Chicago  I requested that the FCC put out any specific changes that would be voted on in a new notice of proposed rulemaking so that the American people have an opportunity to review it    In closing  I ask you to reconsider your proposed timeline  put out any specific change to the rules for public comment and review  move to establish an independent panel on minority and small business media ownership  and complete a proceeding on the responsibilities that broadcasters have to the communities in which they operate  Sincerely    Senator Barack Obama
