    Obama Demands VA Immediately Investigate Drug Testing on Veterans Tuesday  June 17  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary James Peake  calling on him to immediately investigate reports that the VA failed to notify veterans about severe side effects from drug testing after the FDA issued a serious warning last November   According to a Washington Times ABC News investigation  more than 1 000 veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  participated in a study to examine ways to end smoking   143 of the study participants took the anti smoking drug Chantix  which the FDA found lead to side effects  including hallucinations  suicide attempts  and psychotic behavior   Study participants were not notified about the FDA warning until three months later  and were not warned about the drug s most severe side effect   suicide    In the letter Obama calls on Peake to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the process by which VA conducts clinical trials and to take immediate corrective action to address the problems that were first identified by GAO eight years ago     The text of the letter is below     Dear Secretary Peake  I was very concerned to read this morning s Washington Times and learn that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  has yet again failed to take appropriate steps to safeguard the health and well being of veterans participating in drug trials  According to a Washington Times ABC News investigation  the VA took three months to notify patients about severe side effects from the anti smoking drug Chantix   Almost 1 000 veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  were paid  30 a month to participate in a study examining ways to end smoking   A total of 143 of the study participants took the anti smoking drug Chantix  Last November  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  issued an alert regarding reports that Chantix led to hallucinations  suicide attempts  and psychotic behavior   Even though almost 40 suicides and more than 400 examples of suicidal behavior were eventually attributed to Chantix nationwide  the VA waited three months after the FDA advisory to alert its study participants about the mental health risks of the drug   And when the VA did finally notify study participants  it failed to mention the most serious side effects of suicide and suicidal thoughts   According to the Washington Times ABC News investigation  21 veterans have reported adverse effects from Chantix   In addition to Chantix  the VA is testing other drugs on veterans with PTSD that carry warnings of suicidal side effects  I understand that clinical research is a vital mission of the VA   Clinical research is not only a source of new treatments for veterans but also a way to recruit and retain the nation s best doctors   However  as I am sure you would agree  the VA has a special responsibility to maintain the most rigorous standards when conducting research on such a vulnerable population   These trials should only be conducted when VA fully informs patients of the risks of the drugs they are taking  and adequately monitors the patients for side effects   These requirements are especially important when dealing with vulnerable patients such as veterans suffering from PTSD  Unfortunately  the lack of protections for participants in clinical trials is a longstanding problem at VA   Following the suspension of all research at the Veterans Affairs of Greater Los Angeles Health Care System in 1999  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified numerous problems in the way that human research subjects were treated at VA facilities  including  failures to provide adequate information to subjects before they participated in research     In a follow up investigation in June 2003  GAO found that  VA has not taken sufficient action to strengthen protections for human subjects since we made our recommendations nearly 3 years ago  and that  VA has not established a mechanism for handling adverse event reports to ensure that  Institutional Review Boards  have the information they need to safeguard the rights and welfare of human research participants   It is outrageous and unacceptable that our government would irresponsibly endanger veterans who have already sacrificed so much for our country   Our veterans   particularly those suffering from mental health injuries   should have the very best health care and support in the world   They should never be needlessly exposed to drugs without proper notification of the dangers involved or effective monitoring of the side effects      It is distressing that our government could once again let down our veterans and their families who have given so much to their country   It is time to demand accountability and to ensure that this kind of breach of trust never takes place again   Accordingly  I call on you to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the process by which VA conducts clinical trials and to take immediate corrective action to address the problems that were first identified by GAO eight years ago    I ask that you notify my office by Friday  June 20  2008  as to whether you will order such an investigation   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
