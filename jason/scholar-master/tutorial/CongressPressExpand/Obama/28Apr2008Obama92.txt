   Durbin   Obama Ask for Meeting With DOJ Officials to Discuss the Inclusion of Chicago in Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Durbin   Obama Ask for Meeting With DOJ Officials to Discuss the Inclusion of Chicago in Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative Monday  April 28  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Recent spike in violent crime warrants additional federal resources WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked for a meeting with Justice Department officials and Illinois Congressional Delegation members to discuss including the Chicago metropolitan area in the Department of Justice  DOJ  s Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative   a program created in 2006 to enhance gang prevention  enforcement  and anti recidivism efforts   The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative has so far provided ten metropolitan regions with  2 5 million each for anti gang efforts   Chicago is home to some of the largest and most violent gangs in the country  but has been left out of one of the most highly touted federal anti gang initiatives   said Durbin    We are asking the Justice Department to make combating gang violence in Chicago a top priority this summer and in the future      With as many as 40 gang related shootings in the past week alone and so many tragic deaths this year  the violence in our neighborhoods and schools is heartbreaking and has got to stop   said Obama    Chicago has experienced some of the highest rates of gang violence in the country  and combating it must be a top priority for the Department of Justice s anti gang initiative and for the federal government   We also know that we must involve the entire community   from our schools and churches to teachers and parents   it makes a difference and it saves lives   Senator Durbin and I are committed to working with Mayor Daley and Chicago s dedicated law enforcement personnel to ensure the city has the resources it needs to protect our families and keep our children safe   Since April 18  at least 48 shootings have taken place in the Chicago area resulting in at least 15 deaths   Law enforcement officials have expressed concern that as the weather warms  gang violence will remain elevated    In April 2006  DOJ released the results of its latest National Youth Gang Center survey  which indicated that over half of all homicides in Chicago were considered to be gang related   Los Angeles was the only other city in which gang activity accounted for such a high percentage of the city s homicides   The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative is a key component of DOJ s anti gang strategy and is designed to support law enforcement combating violent gang crime  while also promoting prevention efforts that discourage gang involvement  The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative complements existing Department of Justice programs to combat gangs and reduce gun related crime throughout the country      text of letter below and attached  April 28  2008 The Honorable Michael Mukasey  Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney General Mukasey  We urge you to take immediate steps to focus additional resources of the Department of Justice on combating gang violence in the Chicago metropolitan area   The past 10 days have witnessed a spike in violent crimes in Chicago  with at least 48 shootings resulting in at least 15 deaths   Also  this school year 24 children in the Chicago area have been killed by gunfire   Much of this violence is attributable to gang activity  and gang violence in the region is expected to remain at an elevated level in the coming warm weather months   Reducing this level of violence will require an enhanced commitment from the Department of Justice in conjunction with state and local law enforcement and gang prevention organizations   We strongly urge the Department of Justice to make the reduction of gang violence in the Chicago area a top priority of the Department s anti gang efforts   We also request a meeting with you and appropriate Department of Justice officials  along with members of the Illinois congressional delegation  to discuss this issue   While Chicago area law enforcement agencies are working hard to head off a surge in gang violence  targeted assistance from the Department of Justice would greatly boost their gang prevention and enforcement efforts   For example  a key part of the Department of Justice s anti gang strategy is the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative  which was created in 2006   The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative has so far provided ten metropolitan regions with  2 5 million each in order to enhance gang prevention  enforcement  and anti recidivism efforts in those areas   In January  you testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that  focused enforcement efforts under the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative are showing strong early results    However  Chicago is not one of the regions selected for participation in the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative   Given the severity of the gang problem in the Chicago area and the existence of established infrastructure to support enhanced prevention  enforcement and anti recidivism efforts in Chicago  the inclusion of Chicago in the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative appears both appropriate and justified   We urge you to include Chicago in this Initiative  Also  after your January testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Senator Durbin asked you in writing to provide information on the Department of Justice s current efforts to address gang violence in the Chicago region   You have not yet responded   Before our meeting  please provide this information in writing     Ridding our communities of gang violence will require a sustained  cooperative effort involving effective prevention strategies  active enforcement  close coordination between local  state and federal governments  and a renewed focus on addressing the underlying factors that contribute to gang behavior   The Department of Justice plays a vital part in these efforts  and the Department s urgent attention is needed now in the Chicago metropolitan region   We look forward to working with you to address this challenge    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin                                                U S  Senator  Barack Obama  U S  Senator                                                       cc  Mark Filip
