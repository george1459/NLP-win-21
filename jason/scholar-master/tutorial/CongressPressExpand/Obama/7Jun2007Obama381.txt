   Obama Statement on the Senate   s Failure to Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on the Senate   s Failure to Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform Thursday  June  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt       WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement following the Senate vote on immigration reform       I am very disappointed by our failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform  This crisis demands that we take action   Holes remain in our borders   Millions of undocumented immigrants persist in the shadows  And the marches will continue across the nation until we muster the political will to pass comprehensive reform that protects our security  bolsters our economy  and preserves America s tradition as a nation of immigrants who are welcomed as long as they work hard and play by the rules          The bill in the Senate was imperfect   The guestworker program and the points system devaluing family reunification were flawed  and more needed to be done to ensure that we have a workable system for verifying who is eligible to work in this country   But the bill did contain important elements  such as stronger border control and a path to citizenship for 12 million undocumented immigrants     proposals that the majority of Americans support and the execution of which the country can ill afford to postpone          For the past two weeks  I have worked with my colleagues to fix the problems in this bill   And  I believe that we could have reached agreement in the Senate and sent the bill to the House for further improvements   Unfortunately  after repeated efforts  it is clear that this debate would not reach resolution here today   I remain hopeful  however  that the Senate will revisit this issue in the near future because we have a responsibility to fix our broken immigration system
