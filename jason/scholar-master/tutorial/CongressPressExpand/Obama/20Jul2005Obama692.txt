   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Anti Lynching Apology Resolution   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Anti Lynching Apology Resolution Tuesday  June 14  2005  Statement of Senator Barack Obama  Anti Lynching Apology Resolution  Monday  June 13th  2005  Remarks as delivered Mr  OBAMA  Mr  President  I rise in strong support of this resolution  Before I make any further remarks  I would like to recognize Doria D  Johnson  and thank her for coming  She is from Evanston  IL  Ms  Johnson is the great  great granddaughter of Anthony Crawford  a South Carolina farmer who was lynched nearly 100 years ago for the crime of being a successful Black farmer  I am sure that this day has special meaning for her  and for the other family members of those who were impacted by these great tragedies of the past  I thank her and others for being here today   Since America s darkest days of Jim Crow  separate but equal  fire hoses  church bombings  cross burnings and lynchings  the people of this great Nation have found the courage  on occasion  to speak up and speak out so that we can right this country s wrongs  and walk together down that long road of transformation that continues to perfect our Union  It is a transformation that brought us the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act  a transformation that led to the first Black Member of Congress  and the first Black and White children holding hands in the same playground and the same school  a transformation without which I would not be standing here speaking today  But I am  And I am proud because  thanks to this resolution  we are taking another step in acknowledging a dark corner of our history  We are taking a step that allows us  after looking at the 4 700 deaths from lynchings  the hate that was behind those deaths  and this Chamber s refusal to try and stop them  to finally say that we were wrong   There is a power in acknowledging error and mistake  It is a power that potentially transforms not only those who were impacted directly by the lynchings  but also those who are the progeny of the perpetrators of these crimes  There is a piercing photographic exhibit in Chicago right now that displays some of the lynchings that occurred across the country over the past two centuries  These photographs show that what is often most powerful is not the gruesome aspects of the lynching itself  nor the terrible rending of the body that took place  No  what is most horrific  what is most disturbing to the soul is the photographs in which you see young little White girls or young little White boys with their parents on an outing  looking at the degradation of another human being  One wonders not only what the lynching did to the family member of those who were lynched  but also what the effect was on the sensibilities of those young people who stood there  watching   Now that we are finally acknowledging this injustice  we have an opportunity to reflect on the cruelties that inhabit all of us  We can now take the time to teach our children to treat people who look different than us with the same respect that we would expect for ourselves  So it is fitting  it is proper  and it is right that we are doing what we are doing today   However  I do hope  as we commemorate this past injustice  that this Chamber also spends some time doing something concrete and tangible to heal the long shadow of slavery and the legacy of racial discrimination  so that 100 years from now we can look back and be proud  and not have to apologize once again  That means completing the unfinished work of the civil rights movement  and closing the gap that still exists in health care  education  and income  There are more ways to perpetrate violence than simply a lynching   There is the violence that we subject young children to when they do not have any opportunity or hope  when they stand on street corners not thinking much of themselves  not thinking that their lives are worth living  That is a form of violence that this Chamber could do something about   As we are spending time apologizing today for these past failures of the Senate to act  we should also spend some time debating the extension of the Voting Rights Act and the best way to extend health care coverage to over 45 million uninsured Americans  We should be considering how we can make certain that college is affordable for young African American children  the great  great grandchildren or the great  great  great grandchildren of those who have been wronged  These are the ways we can finally ensure that the blessings of opportunity reach every single American  and finally claim a victory in the long struggle for civil rights   Today is a step in the right direction  Today s actions give us an opportunity to heal and to move forward  But for those who still harbor anger in their hearts  who still wonder how to move on from such terrible violence  it is worth reflecting for a moment on one remarkable individual  Mamie Till Mobley   Mamie Till Mobley s child Emmett was only 14 years old when they found him in the Mississippi River  beaten and bloodied beyond recognition  After Ms  Mobley saw her child  her baby  unrecognizable  his face so badly beaten it barely looked human  someone suggested that she should have a closed casket at his funeral  She said  No  we are going to have an open casket  and everybody is going to witness what they did to my child   The courage displayed by this mother galvanized the civil rights movement in the North and in the South  And  despite the immensity of the pain she felt  Mamie Till Mobley has repeatedly said  I never wasted a day hating  Imagine that  She never wasted a day hating  not one day   I rise today  thanking God that the United States Congress  the representatives of the American people and our highest ideals  will not waste one more day without issuing the apology that will continue to help us march down the path of transformation that Mamie Till Mobley has been on her whole life  and that the people in attendance in the gallery have been on for generations   I am grateful for this tribute  and I am looking forward to joining hands with my colleagues and the American people to make sure that when our children and grandchildren look back at our actions in this Chamber  we do not have something to apologize for   I yield the floor
