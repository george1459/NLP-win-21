   Obama  Akaka  Tester Seek Information on Apparent Failure to Investigate Rape Allegations Against Halliburton KBR Employees in Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama  Akaka  Tester Seek Information on Apparent Failure to Investigate Rape Allegations Against Halliburton KBR Employees in Iraq Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jesse Broder Van Dyke  Akaka   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Aaron Murphy  Tester    Washington  DC     U S  Senators Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Barack Obama  D IL   and Jon Tester  D MT  today sent letters to the Attorney General  and the Inspector Generals of the Defense and State Departments  seeking information about their apparent failure to investigate allegations made by former Halliburton KBR administrative assistant Jamie Leigh Jones that she was drugged and raped by several co workers while employed at Camp Hope in Baghdad  Iraq     The alleged assault occurred in July 2005  three days after KBR had transferred Ms  Jones to work in Iraq   Ms  Jones was treated at a U S  Army Hospital in Iraq after reporting that she was raped   According to recent news reports  no criminal charges have been filed in the matter and reporters have been unable to confirm that any federal agency is investigating       With tens of thousands of American contractors operating in Iraq  we will not tolerate abuse and misconduct  and these contractors must be held accountable to American criminal law     said Senator Obama      I first introduced legislation nearly 10 months ago to hold contractors accountable  and I will continue to work to develop a solution that closes the legal loopholes  protects our troops and civilians  and promotes America   s values     Senator Akaka said     It has been more than two years since Ms  Jones reported that she was drugged and raped   Ms  Jones    allegations are extremely disturbing  yet it seems that KBR  the Defense Department  and the State Department may have ignored the matter rather than seeking the truth   Some media accounts have suggested that security contractors have blanket legal immunity for what they do in Iraq   That is untrue   But the existing legal loopholes for U S  government contractors working abroad     and the widespread perception that these contractors operate completely free of legal constraints     must be addressed   Congress should make this an urgent priority     Akaka noted that jurisdiction for any future criminal charges brought in the case could come under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 or section 804 of the USA PATRIOT Act      We must ensure that security contractors are subject to real oversight   I will push for a full  fair  and transparent investigation of Jamie Leigh Jones    allegations  and I will continue to support legislation to ensure that security contractors are held to high standards     Akaka stated       I don   t care if it   s in rural Montana  inner city Washington  or military bases in Baghdad   no one is above the law     Senator Tester said      We   ve got some serious questions about this case and it   s not acceptable to sit around waiting for answers     Senator Akaka is Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management  the Federal Workforce  and the District of Columbia  as well as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness   Senators Obama and Tester are members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  A copy of the letter sent to the Attorney General appears below  Similar letters were also sent to Howard J  Krongard
