   Obama to Vote No on the Nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama to Vote No on the Nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court Tuesday  January 24  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  January 24  2006  Obama to Vote No on the Nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr  to the United States Supreme Court     While I certainly believe that Judge Samuel Alito has the training and the qualifications necessary to serve as a Supreme Court Justice  after a careful review of his record  I simply cannot vote for his nomination     The Judicial Branch of our government is a place where any American citizen can stand equal before the eyes of the law   Yet  in examining Judge Alito s many decisions  I have seen extraordinarily consistent support for the powerful against the powerless  for the employer against the employee  for the President against the Congress and the Judiciary  and for an overreaching federal government against individual rights and liberties      By ruling this way so many times over a course of so many years  Judge Alito simply does not inspire confidence that he will serve as an independent voice on the U S  Supreme Court      I do hope that if he is confirmed  he proves me wrong   I hope that he will uphold the best traditions of the Supreme Court as a bastion of equality and justice on behalf of every American citizen
