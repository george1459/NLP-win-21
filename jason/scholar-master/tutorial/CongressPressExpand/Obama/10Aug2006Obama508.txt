   Obama Introduces Bill to Help Tap Power of Genomics to Find Cures   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Introduces Bill to Help Tap Power of Genomics to Find Cures Wednesday  August  9  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 9  2006   Obama Introduces Bill to Help Tap Power of Genomics to Find Cures WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Wednesday announced that he has introduced legislation that will help scientists tap the power of genomics to find treatments for diseases that afflict millions of Americans each year  Obama said the bill would greatly increase funding for research  eliminate regulatory obstacles and create incentives to accelerate private sector innovation  Ever since James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of human DNA in 1953  our understanding of the structure and function of genes  commonly referred to as genomics  has grown exponentially  In 2003  the National Human Genome Research Institute and Department of Energy announced that they had successfully decoded the 3 billion base pairs of human DNA  raising the hope of a medical revolution  But despite significant scientific advances  very few genomic based tests or treatments have reached consumers  Senator Obama s legislation  the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act  will work to overcome scientific barriers  adverse market pressures and regulatory obstacles that have stood in the way of better health care   For more than a decade  we have been on the verge of a new era in medicine  but scientific hurdles  adverse market pressures and outdated regulations have blocked progress   Obama said   This bill will help jumpstart innovation and clear the obstacles that have stood in the way of saving lives    Scientists are only beginning to understand how our genetic makeup affects our propensity for disease or how we will respond to medicine  Today  the typical  blockbuster  drug is effective in only 40 to 60 percent of patients prescribed them  Meanwhile  serious adverse drug reactions impact 2 2 million people and kill an estimated 100 000 people per year in this country   Genomics could eventually help predict which Americans will get sick  diagnose illness earlier  and screen patients to determine which drugs will be effective and safe  Doctors may eventually apply this science to personalize drug treatment to an individual patient s genetic makeup  significantly improving health care outcomes and quality  Drug manufacturers  meanwhile  will be able to better anticipate which new medicines will work  speeding up drug discovery   Senator Obama s legislation seeks to spur innovation by allocating  150 million for research in genomics  It also provides a 100 percent tax credit for private research to develop of companion diagnostic tests that can improve the effectiveness or safety of certain drugs  The bill would modernize the Food and Drug Administration s outdated process for reviewing genomic tests   The legislation also would help develop a system to collect  evaluate and synthesize genomic data from around the nation  providing researchers with an invaluable resource   It would also establish an interagency task force to accelerate the use of this research and would encourage the recruitment and retention of health professionals in the field of genomics   Genomics holds the promise of revolutionary advances in medicine   Obama said   Hopefully Congress will soon realize the enormous potential of genomics and pass this legislation to support it
