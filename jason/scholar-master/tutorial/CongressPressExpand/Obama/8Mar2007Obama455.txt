   Obama Bill Would Make Election Fraud and Voter Intimidation Publishable by Law   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Bill Would Make Election Fraud and Voter Intimidation Publishable by Law Wednesday  March  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  202  228 5511 U S  Senator Barack Obama testified today before the House Judiciary Committee on deceptive practices in elections  Obama sponsored the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act  which would make election fraud and voter intimidation punishable by law  and the Voter Advocate and Democracy Index Act  which would require states to report on their election performance  His testimony is below   I was pleased to introduce the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act in the Senate  along with my colleague Senator Charles Schumer  and others such as Senator Kennedy and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Patrick Leahy  and I am honored that my colleagues in the House  including Chairman Conyers  Congressman Emanuel  Congressmen Becerra  Honda  and Ellison  introduced companion legislation last week   It   s hard to imagine that we even need a bill like this   But  unfortunately  there are people who will stop at nothing to try to deceive voters and keep them away from the polls   What   s worse  these practices often target and exploit vulnerable populations  such as minorities  the disabled  or the poor   We saw countless examples in this past election   Some of us remember the thousands of Latino voters in Orange County  California  who received letters warning them in Spanish that     if you are an immigrant  voting in a federal election is a crime that can result in incarceration       Or the voters in Maryland who received a    democratic sample ballot    featuring a Republican candidate for Governor and a Republican candidate for U S  Senator   Or the voters in Virginia who received calls from a so called    Virginia Elections Commission    informing them     falsely     that they were ineligible to vote   Or the voters who were told that they couldn   t vote if they had family members who had been convicted of a crime    Of course  these so called warnings have no basis in fact  and are made with only one goal in mind     to keep Americans away from the polls   We see these problems year after year and election and after election  and my hope is that this bill will finally stop these practices in time for the next election   The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act makes voter intimidation and deception punishable by law  and it contains strong penalties so that people who commit these crimes suffer more than just a slap on the wrist   The bill also seeks to address the real harm of these crimes    people who are prevented from voting by misinformation     by establishing a process for reaching out to these misinformed voters with accurate information so they can cast their votes in time   There are some issues in this country that are inherently difficult and political   Making sure that every American can cast a ballot shouldn   t be one of them   There is no place for politics in this debate     no room for those who feel that they can gain a partisan advantage by keeping people away from the polls   As the New York Times stated in its January 31st editorial on this issue     the bill     is an important step toward making elections more honest and fair  There is no reason it should not be passed by Congress unanimously      I ask that this editorial be placed into the record   It   s time to get this done in a bipartisan fashion  and I believe this bill can make it happen   I look forward to working with you  Chairman Conyers  and the other members of the Committee  as well as the many co sponsors of this bill  to pass this legislation this Congress
