   Obama Response to the President s State of the Union Address   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Response to the President s State of the Union Address Tuesday  January 23  2007  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 23  2007  Obama Response to the President s State of the Union Address    The President offered some serious proposals tonight on two issues   energy and health care   that we all agree must be addressed   I m glad he did and I think it s important to respond in a constructive way   But the last election proved that politics by slogan and poll tested sound bites aren t going to cut it with the American people anymore  and that s why the real test of leadership is not what the President said to Congress tonight  but how he works with Congress to find real solutions to the problems we face       The good news is that in the halls of Congress and across the nation  there is widespread support from both Democrats and Republicans on how to meet the major challenges facing America      Most Americans believe that escalation will not bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end  and that s why I ve proposed not just a troop cap  but a phased redeployment that will start bringing our troops home   Most Americans believe that energy independence will come from using more biofuels like ethanol and making cars that actually use less oil  which is why I proposed a bipartisan plan that would raise fuel economy standards for the first time in decades   Most Americans believe that the biggest domestic challenge facing the country is the high cost of health care  and that s why incremental plans that do nothing to bring down costs or guarantee coverage are simply no longer sufficient      The American people have been waiting for leadership commensurate to the challenges we face  and they ll be watching to see if bold rhetoric is followed by bold action in the months to come
