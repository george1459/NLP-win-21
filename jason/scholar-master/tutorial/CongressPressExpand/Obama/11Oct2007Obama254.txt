   Obama Calls for Investigation into Violations by Private Medicare Insurers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Calls for Investigation into Violations by Private Medicare Insurers Wednesday  October 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511  Requests additional oversight  answers from GAO   WASHINGTON  DC     Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to open an investigation into Medicare Advantage programs    Recent reports have exposed cases of private insurers exploiting America s seniors by denying access to needed health care services and medications  improperly denying claims  engaging in deceptive sales practices  and providing poor customer service    Below is the text of Senator Obama s letter    October 8  2007   The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office   441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548    Dear Mr  Walker    I am writing to request that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  immediately open an investigation into the exploitation of senior citizens by private insurers participating in the Medicare Advantage program     According to an analysis by the New York Times  tens of thousands of Medicare recipients have been the victims of deceptive sales practices by these private insurance companies  had claims improperly denied or denied without explanation  and received poor customer service in trying to get their questions answered   In some cases  the practices of these companies were found to have affected the health of patients by delaying access to urgently needed health care services and medications      Medicare has been a successful program for four decades  in part because it has been free of such practices   And if this is the price of introducing private insurers into the system  the cost for America and our senior citizens is too high    Among the examples of problems identified by these audits were    UnitedHealth and Humana denied claims without giving any explanation to beneficiaries   WellPoint had a backlog of 354 000 claims  its call center required an average of 27 minutes to answer phone calls from beneficiaries and 16 minutes to answer calls from providers  and more than half of the callers hung up without speaking to a customer service representative   Sierra Health Services stopped drug coverage for 2 300 beneficiaries with HIV AIDS when the company mistakenly thought that the beneficiaries had not paid their premiums   and  Humana had so many complaints about its marketing practices that it could not investigate all of them     Other news stories in recent months have detailed how insurance companies aggressively market private Medicare plans to seniors   in some cases even forging their signatures and providing false information   What is particularly egregious is that these private plans receive higher subsidies for services than under traditional Medicare   The Medicare Payment Admission Commission recently reported that on average the government pays 12 percent more to private Medicare plans than it costs to treat comparable beneficiaries through traditional Medicare   These excessive subsidies cost the government billions of dollars every year    Given the popularity of Medicare Advantage plans     enrollment has increased to 8 7 million from 5 3 million in 2003     it is important to ensure these companies are providing the services for which they are reimbursed   This year  the federal government will pay private insurers  76 3 billion for participating in the Medicare Advantage program   I am pleased that GAO has already started this oversight process as evidenced by a July 2007 report finding that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was not complying with a requirement that it audit the financial records of one third of participating companies      However  I believe that GAO needs to conduct additional oversight into how America  s senior citizens are treated by these private companies   Specifically  I believe that GAO should open an investigation into the following    The extent of deceptive practices in the marketing of Medicare Advantage programs   Whether beneficiaries are wrongly being denied needed health care services and medications   Whether the claims of beneficiaries are being improperly denied or denied without sufficient explanation  The speed with which appeals of claims denials are considered   Whether customer service representatives are responsive to the questions and concerns of beneficiaries  and  Whether additional safeguards are necessary to protect beneficiaries     Given the seriousness of this issue and its effect on America  s senior citizens  I appreciate your prompt attention to this request   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
