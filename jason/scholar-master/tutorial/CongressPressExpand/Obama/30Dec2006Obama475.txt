Standards Plan Echoes Senators  Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Fuel Economy Standards   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Lugar  R IN   and Joe Biden  D DE  today praised the Energy Security Leadership Council for recommending that the United States greatly reduce its dependence on foreign oil by enacting a proposal to increase fuel economy standards that is nearly identical to legislation they introduced in July  Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   Dick Durbin  D IL   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Chuck Schumer  D NY  are also cosponsors of the legislation    The Energy Security Leadership Council is an effort by a collection of prominent business leaders and retired senior military officers to build support for a comprehensive  long term policy to reduce U S  oil dependence and improve energy security  To read a copy of the report  visit this website  http   www secureenergy org     The true danger of America s dependence on foreign oil is best explained by enemies like Al Qaeda  who have said that oil      is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community    Obama said    It is clear that the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on earth is the oil we import and cannot live without  and that is why we must increase the fuel efficiency of our cars with technology we already have on the shelf       Leadership by private industry  the military  and across sectors and levels of government is an essential component in making meaningful progress   Lugar said   I m pleased that the Council and SAFE have made an important contribution to our ongoing policy debate   Increasing fuel economy is one facet of a comprehensive energy strategy that the United States must adopt in the interest of our national security      If it was not clear before  it is now  Domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Joseph R  Biden   For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks       The bipartisan legislation  the Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006  seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of approximately 1 mile per gallon each year  The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved    This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised    In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year    If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028    The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars
