people to work at improving our roads and our bridges and our public transportation so that Illinois can still be the crossroads of a 21st century America   said Obama   This bill will provide much needed and long overdue investments in transportation in Illinois     This transportation bill makes a significant investment in highways and transit infrastructure that is so important to communities across the state   said Durbin   Senator Obama helped write this bill and made sure Illinois received its fair share of highway and transit funds  I was pleased to work with him and our Illinois colleagues in the House to provide the funding needed for our roads  bridges  and transit systems     Under the transportation bill passed in 1998  Illinois received an average of  927 million each year  Under the current Senate bill  Illinois will receive an average of  1 236 billion a year  or  309 million more per year  Over the five year life of the bill  that is  1 545 billion more for Illinois  an increase of 33 34 percent more each year than under TEA 21    Under this bill  Illinois transit will receive  2 1 billion in formula funds  In the previous Transportation bill  Illinois received only  1 9 billion over six years  Over a comparable 6 year period  Illinois would receive  2 467 billion   128  over TEA 21 s level    Obama and Durbin said that for every  1 billion spent on transportation infrastructure  it is estimated that 24 000 new jobs are supported  By providing Illinois with  1 2 billion per year in transportation funding  this bill will support tens of thousands
