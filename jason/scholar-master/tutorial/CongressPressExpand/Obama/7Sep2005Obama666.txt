              Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic Tuesday  August  9  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 9  2005   Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O  Leavitt  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today asked the Bush administration to immediately begin creating a stockpile of avian flu vaccines and antivirals sufficient to protect 25 percent of the U S  population    It has been estimated that with no vaccine or antiviral drugs  93 million Americans would be infected with avian flu  and 164 000 would die   said Obama   However  if an effective vaccine is provided to 80 percent of individuals younger than 19 years of age  the estimated numbers decrease to 6 million total cases and 15 000 total deaths  A sufficient supply of antivirals could have the same protective effect     Recent news reports indicate that the avian flu vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur may be effective in preventing the disease  However  the vaccine was only proven to be effective when administered at a high dose  which means that the 2 million vaccines doses already acquired by the government would protect only about 450 000 Americans  Similarly  the current supply of the antiviral used to prevent and treat avian flu is grossly inadequate    The World Health Organization recommends that countries maintain a stockpile of antivirals capable of treating 25  of their population   said Obama   However  between the U S  government s current stockpile and its plan to order additional doses  there are only enough treatments for 2  of the U S  population  Roche  which manufactures the drug  has stated that it could supply 13 million more courses of treatment in 2006 and an additional 70 million in 2007  if ordered by the U S  government     We must accelerate efforts to produce an effective vaccine against avian flu and stockpile enough doses of vaccines and antivirals to prevent and treat avian flu     Full text of the letter below      August 9  2005    The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary of Health and Human Services  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Washington  DC  20510   Dear Secretary Leavitt    I am writing to urge the Bush Administration to take immediate action to prepare for and respond to a potential avian flu pandemic     Such a pandemic is becoming increasingly more likely given bird to human transmission of avian flu and the persistent and growing numbers of infected chickens and other birds around the world   The only remaining requirement for pandemic avian flu is efficient human to human transmission  and there is some concern that this may soon occur   Given the high mortality rate from avian flu among those who have contracted the virus thus far  the world would experience human suffering and death of cataclysmic proportions if immediate steps are not taken to prevent and mitigate its impact    Unlike previous pandemics  these early warnings about a potential avian flu pandemic have provided the United States with a small window of opportunity to prepare for this eventuality   In particular  we must accelerate efforts to produce an effective vaccine against avian flu and stockpile enough doses of antivirals to prevent and treat avian flu   It has been estimated that with no vaccine or antiviral drugs  93 million Americans would be infected with avian flu  and 164 000 would die   However  if an effective vaccine is provided to 80 percent of individuals younger than 19 years of age  the estimated numbers decrease to 6 million total cases and 15 000 total deaths   A sufficient supply of antivirals could have the same protective effect    I was encouraged by this week s announcement that the latest clinical trials of the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine against avian flu were successful   However  the vaccine was only effective when given in high doses  which means that the 2 million vaccine doses already acquired by the government would protect only about 450 000 Americans   I understand from news accounts yesterday that the U S  government is preparing to purchase additional doses from Sanofi            Similarly  the current supply of the antiviral oseltamavir is grossly inadequate to protect or treat the U S  population  let alone to assist efforts by our international partners    The World Health Organization recommends that countries maintain a stockpile of antivirals capable of treating 25  of their population   However  between the U S  government s current stockpile and its plan to order additional doses  there are only enough treatments for 2  of the U S  population   Roche  which manufactures the drug  has stated that it could supply 13 million more courses of treatment in 2006 and an additional 70 million in 2007  if ordered by the U S  government     But  vaccines and antivirals are not enough   More needs to be done to strengthen and expand our nation s public health infrastructure   Public health providers will play a pivotal role in training doctors and other health practitioners  delivering preventive and medical care  communicating with the public  and conducting continuous surveillance     Since any avian flu pandemic would likely begin abroad  the U S  should be working with international health organizations on assisting poor countries to purchase vaccines and antivirals and to develop a system for quickly distributing the drugs in the event of a pandemic    Over the past six months  I have pushed for   and the Senate has appropriated    35 million to assist in the fight against the avian flu   The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act  S  600   which could pass the Senate this fall  would require the establishment of an interagency task force to design and implement a comprehensive  international strategy to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   I also have introduced the AVIAN Act  S  969  which would improve domestic and international preparedness against a potential pandemic  including procuring vaccines and antivirals for a strategic national stockpile and studying the creation of an international fund to support pandemic control     To improve this country s preparedness for a potential avian flu pandemic  I urge the Administration to take a number of steps immediately    The U S  government should begin creating a national stockpile with sufficient doses of antivirals to protect 25  of the U S  population   If subsequent studies confirm the effectiveness of an avian flu vaccine  the U S  government should begin creating a national stockpile with sufficient vaccine doses to protect 25  of the U S  population   The U S  government should finalize its domestic preparedness plan to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   The U S  government should establish an interagency task force to design and implement a comprehensive  international strategy to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu  and  The U S  government should work with international health organizations to assist other countries in purchasing necessary vaccines and antivirals     Please notify me by August 23  2005  as to what  if any  steps the Administration is taking in these areas   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama              United States Senator
