                     Obama Says Disaster Evacuation Plans Must Account for Society   s Most Vulnerable Monday  September 12  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 12  2005  Obama Says Disaster Evacuation Plans Must Account for Society s Most Vulnerable    WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation that would require states to prepare disaster evacuation plans that account for the needs of society s most vulnerable members  including the poor  the disabled and the elderly    It is the duty of our government to keep all Americans safe in times of emergency  especially those in our society who are not always able to help themselves   said Obama   But in the days and weeks since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast  it has become overwhelmingly clear that this was not the case  The government did not adequately prepare to evacuate those who could not afford a car  did not adequately prepare to evacuate the elderly  and did not adequately prepare to evacuate those who were too sick to leave their beds     It has been widely reported that the Hurricane Katrina evacuation plan did not adequately account for the special needs of low income populations  Obama s bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to mandate that each state include plans for the evacuation of individuals with special needs during times of emergency  These people would include low income individuals and families  the elderly  the disabled  and those who cannot speak English  The plans must consider how these people would be evacuated out of the emergency area but also how the states would provide shelter  food  and water to these people once they are evacuated  Obama s bill would require that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security report each state s evacuation plan within one year after the legislation becomes law    What we saw in the Gulf Coast cannot be repeated   said Obama   We may not be able to control the wrath of Mother Nature  but we can control how we prepare for natural disasters     The bill is cosponsored by Senators Evan Bayh  D IN   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Jon Corzine  D NJ   Russ Feingold  D WI   Tom Harkin  D IA   Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Carl Levin  D MI     Obama was also joined by 18 other Senate Democrats in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asking that the Secretary ensure all evacuation plans include consideration for those in our society who are the most vulnerable  Please find full text of the letter below      September 9  2005    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Nebraska Avenue Center  NW  Washington  DC 20528  Dear Secretary Chertoff  One of the most striking aspects of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina is that the majority of stranded victims were our society s most vulnerable members   low income families  the elderly  the homeless  the disabled  or non English speaking individuals   Many did not own cars   Many believed themselves unable to flee the city  unable to forego the income from missed work  unable to incur the expenses of travel  food  and lodging   Some may have misunderstood the severity of the warnings  if they heard the warnings at all   Some may have needed help that was unavailable   Whatever the reason  they were not evacuated and we have seen the horrific results  It appears that certain assumptions were made in planning and preparing for the worst case scenario in New Orleans   After all  most of those who could afford to evacuate managed to do so   They drove out of town and checked into hotels or stayed with friends and family   But what about the thousands of people left behind because they had special needs  Our charge as public servants is to worry about all of the people   We are troubled that our emergency response and disaster plans were apparently inadequate for large segments of the Gulf Coast population   We wonder whether the plans in other regions are similarly inadequate   Perfect evacuation planning is obviously impractical  but greater advance preparation can ensure that the most vulnerable are not simply forgotten or ignored  We urge you to develop a process by which all emergency planning efforts address the unique challenges of evacuating and or delivering emergency services to people with special needs   Questions that the Department needs to address include  Is there a transportation strategy for those without private vehicles  or funds for alternative private travel  Is there a temporary relocation strategy for those who cannot afford hotels or who have no nearby relatives with whom to reside  Are there adequate stockpiles of food  water  and medicine accessible to low income and special needs communities  or plans for immediate delivery  Do emergency professionals have the training and equipment required to assist people with mental or physical disabilities  Is there a strategy for ensuring that the millions of unauthorized immigrants in the country participate in evacuations free from fear of incarceration or deportation  Is there an adequate communication strategy for those without sufficient English or reading ability  or for the visually and hearing impaired  Communities with special needs may be more challenging to accommodate  but they are every bit as important to protect and serve in the event of an emergency   And though we cannot condone unauthorized immigration  we cannot have this population evading law enforcement during a crisis  We request that you provide information to us on the steps that the Department and its subsidiary agencies are taking to ensure that emergency planning at all levels is improved in this important way  Thank you for your attention to this matter  Sincerely  U S  Senator Barack Obama
