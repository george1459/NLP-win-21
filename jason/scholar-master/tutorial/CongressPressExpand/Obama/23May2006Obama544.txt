Secretary  United States Department of Labor  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20210   Dear Secretary Chao    We are writing regarding the decision of Whirlpool  Inc  to close Maytag washer and dryer plants in Illinois and Arkansas   These plant closings will have a significant impact on thousands of our constituents  and we request the immediate assistance of the Department of Labor  DOL  in helping displaced Maytag workers get back on their feet    As you know  Whirlpool announced on May 10 that it would be closing laundry appliance plants in Illinois  Arkansas  and Iowa   The Illinois facility is located in Herrin and employs 1 000 people  the Arkansas facility is located in Searcy and employs 700 people   These plants form the backbone of their respective communities  and the loss of these 1 700 jobs will be felt deeply by families across each of our states    We understand that state officials and community leaders are attempting to stop or mitigate these plant closings   However  we want to make sure that if the closings go forward  the 1 700 individuals in Illinois and Arkansas who will lose their jobs will have immediate access to the full range of DOL programs and services     Specifically  we request that the Department immediately mobilize resources through the DOL Rapid Response program to begin working with state and local workforce development agencies and local One Stop Career Centers to help Maytag employees transition into new jobs   These workers will require   career counseling and job search assistance  information about unemployment insurance  opportunities for education and training  and information about their health benefits and pensions options   We understand that Rapid Response specialists have a unique ability to provide this training  and we request that these specialists be mobilized immediately to help displaced Maytag workers    Further  we understand that Illinois and Arkansas may apply for Department of Labor National Emergency Grants to expand their capacity to respond to this crisis   We fully support and urge the Department s approval of any such application  as these layoffs significantly exceed the minimum criteria for National Emergency Grant assistance      Finally  we expect that many of our dislocated constituents will apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance   Competition from foreign imports may have played a central role in the loss of these 1 700 jobs   We hope the Department will consider certifying these displaced workers as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance  which will help them return to suitable employment as quickly as possible    We appreciate your timely consideration of these requests   These plant closings will devastate our constituents in Herrin and Searcy  and 1 700 families are in urgent need of our government s assistance   We look forward to working with you to provide them with the help they require     Sincerely    Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   Senator Barack Obama  D IL   Senator Blanche Lincoln  D AR   Senator Mark Pryor  D AR
