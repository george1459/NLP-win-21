four day Downstate tour to hold town hall meetings in 12 different counties   Too often  politicians end up representing Washington to their constituents rather than representing their constituents in Washington   said Obama   These town hall meetings give me the opportunity to hear directly from people in Illinois about the issues affecting their lives and how I can help  It also gives me a chance to talk with them about the issues I ve been working on in the Senate  like reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil by increasing ethanol production  making sure Illinois veterans get the disability pay and health care they ve earned  or the transportation bill I helped write that brought 33 percent more federal funding for infrastructure to Illinois   During his trip  Obama will make several stops at gas stations that sell E85 fuel to promote ethanol use  On Monday  August 8  President Bush will sign the comprehensive Energy bill into law  This bill includes legislation Senator Obama wrote that will provide a 30  tax credit up to  30 000 for the construction of E85 ethanol pumps  Experts estimate this provision will triple of the number of fueling stations that offer E85 in the next year   Monday  August 15 9 00 AM CST        Union County town hall meeting with Senator Obama                                      Anna Veterans Home multi purpose room
