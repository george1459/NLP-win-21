   Obama  Bond Hail New Safeguards on Military Personality Disorder Discharges  Urge Further Action   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Bond Hail New Safeguards on Military Personality Disorder Discharges  Urge Further Action Monday  October  1  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                     Contact  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Shana Marchio  BOND    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Kit Bond  R MO  and Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  lauded the Senate   s inclusion of an amendment to limit the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges in the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill   This provision would add additional safeguards to discharge procedures and require a thorough review by the Government Accountability Office  GAO    According to recent reports  there have been some cases in which the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately used these procedures to discharge service members with service connected psychological injuries   Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time   This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Boxer  D CA   Lieberman  ID CT   McCaskill  D MO   Murray  D WA   Sanders  I VT  and Lincoln  D AR      With thousands of American service members suffering day in and day out from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing     said Senator Obama      It means that those who have served this country aren   t getting the care they need to heal from injuries like PTSD or brain injuries  This provision will add additional safeguards to the Department of Defense   s use of this discharge and mandate a comprehensive review of these policies   This is an important first step and I will continue to fight for additional safeguards as well as the establishment of an independent review board to examine questionable cases in which service members were forced to fight a second war at home   Given our service members    courage and sacrifice for our country  it is our moral obligation to ensure that they receive the care and benefits they deserve        Many of our troops are returning from combat with injuries invisible to the eye but debilitating to them and their families    Unfortunately  many of these injuries have been ignored or worse  dismissed  for too long     said Kit Bond      Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This provision will force the Pentagon to stop using this discharge until we can fix the problem   It is critical that we treat our troops    battle wounds     whether physical or mental        We have no greater obligation than to ensure that our troops receive the care and benefits they deserve for their service to our country     said Senator Lieberman     I applaud the inclusion of this bipartisan amendment in the Senate   s Defense Authorization bill because the Pentagon must take immediate action to ensure that troops are being accurately diagnosed during their service and at discharge for both physical and mental injuries  This amendment will provide DoD with necessary safeguards  and take a closer look at what may be improper discharges of service members with mental health conditions   I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and the Pentagon on resolving any inequities in the system because our soldiers can afford no less     Recent reports suggest that in some cases the Department of Defense  DOD  has improperly and inconsistently used these procedures to discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs   Those discharges can result in the loss of healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt   Army studies have found that up to 30 percent of soldiers coming home from Iraq have suffered from depression  anxiety or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  A recent study found that those who have served multiple tours are 50 percent more likely to suffer from acute combat stress  The military has discharged more than 22 500 service members with for a  pre existing  personality disorder over the past six years  There are indications that some of these brave warriors may instead be suffering from combat related injuries like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injuries   This amendment mandates temporary safeguards on personality disorder discharges  including a high level review of cases before service members can be discharged  as well as a GAO review of the Department of Defense   s current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis    On June 21  2007  Obama joined Senator Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  McCaskill and twenty four other Democratic and Republican senators who wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly
