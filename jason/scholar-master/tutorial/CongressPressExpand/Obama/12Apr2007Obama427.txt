   Obama Calls for Hearing on Election Fraud   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls for Hearing on Election Fraud Thursday  April 12  2007  Raises concerns about possible delays  altered reports WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to the heads of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration requesting a hearing on election fraud in response to a report in the New York Times that the Election Assistance Commission may be altering or delaying the release of reports for political reasons  The text of the letter is below    The Honorable Dianne Feinstein  Chairwoman                                  Committee on Rules and Administration       331 Hart Senate Office Building                      The Honorable Robert Bennett  Ranking Member  Committee on Rules and Administration  431 Dirksen Senate Office Building   Dear Chairwoman Feinstein and Ranking Member Bennett   I am writing to express my concerns regarding recent reports that the Election Assistance Commission  EAC  might be altering reports or delaying the release of reports for political reasons   I ask that the Committee on Rules and Administration conduct a hearing on this troubling issue   Specifically  an article in the New York Times  dated April 11  2007  indicates that the EAC may have unduly delayed the issuance of its report     Election Crimes   An Initial Review and Recommendations for Future Study     as well as altered the report to satisfy partisan demands   The original draft of the report  as written by expert researchers Job Serebrov and Tova Wang and based in part on interviews with a bipartisan group of election experts  indicates that there is strong agreement that there is little voter fraud occurring at the polling place on Election Day   However  the report  as released by the EAC in December 2006  indicates instead that there is    a great deal of debate on the pervasiveness of fraud      Moreover  the New York Times article indicates that the EAC also refused to release another report     Best Practices to Improve Voter Identification Requirements Pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002  Public Law 107 252      That report  which was dated June 28  2006  was only recently released    Its findings in part indicate that there might be a statistically significant correlation between increased voter identification requirements and reduced voter turnout    As you know  the EAC has been entrusted with an important mandate   The integrity of our electoral process is the foundation of our democracy  and the EAC has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of robust  trustworthy voting standards and systems   Unfortunately  this recent episode is just the latest example of a disturbing trend indicating that the EAC is not fulfilling its mandate under the Help America Vote Act   If this Commission falls prey to partisan politics  then it cannot fully execute its duties to the American people  I hope that the Committee on Rules and Administration will hold a hearing on these issues so that the Congress can learn more about the EAC   s recent activities   Thank you both for your consideration  Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator
