of Child care Facilities Contain Toxic Lead   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today said that they have introduced legislation that would help protect children from lead poisoning by requiring that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  The legislation would establish a  42 6 million grant program to help local communities pay to make these facilities safe    For decades  we ve known that lead is poisonous to young children  but 30 years after we banned lead from paint  millions of children are still at risk when they re in day care or at school   said Obama   This legislation will make sure that our kids are protected from lead  and that local communities have the funding they need to make sure these facilities are safe      It is critical that we remove lead hazards where our children live  learn and play   We know that lead poisoning can devastate our children s ability to learn  grow and develop and we need to eliminate these risks and hazards that continue to persist in child care facilities and schools  New York City and Rochester have been at the forefront of grassroots efforts to combat lead poisoning  and this bill would provide important resources and incentives to implement lead prevention programs nationwide   said Senator Clinton    According to the Centers for Disease Control  about 310 000 children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  with poor and minority children disproportionately at risk  The problem of lead contamination is especially great in the Midwest and Northeast where 40 percent of child care centers were built prior to 1960    Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels    Each year in New York State  an additional 10 000 children under the age of six are newly identified as having elevated blood lead levels  and over 200 000 children in New York have had documented lead poisoning between 1992 and 2004  Exposure to lead results in increased expenses each year for New York in the form of special education and other education expenses  medical care for lead poisoned children  and expenditures for delinquent youth and other needing special supervision  It is estimated that these increased expenses  as well as lost earnings  exceed  4 billion annually     The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act of 2006 requires all non home based child care facilities to be certified lead safe in five years   It establishes a five year   42 6 million grant program to help communities reduce lead exposure in day care centers  Head Start programs and kindergartens   It also establishes best practices for communities to test for and reduce lead hazards    Lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of exposure  but significant lead exposure can also come from tap water   Lead is rarely found in the source water used for public water supplies  but more commonly enters tap water as a result of corrosion of water lines  pipes  and household plumbing   Lead in drinking water can be a significant source of lead exposure  and can account for as much as 60 percent of the exposure for infants and children who consume formula and concentrated juices   Children suffer the greatest negative health impacts  since lead adversely impacts physical and mental development  decreased intelligence  behavioral problems  and can also lead to kidney damage  anemia  reproductive disorders  seizures  coma  and even death       Nearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care  An estimated 14 percent of licensed child care centers nationwide are contaminated with hazardous levels of lead based paint  according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development   A recent report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant  systemic problems with the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  monitors and regulates the levels of lead in our nation s drinking water including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make assessments and decisions  The GAO study found that few schools and child care facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead and no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results   Few states have comprehensive programs to detect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities     In June  in response to the GAO report  Senators Obama and Clinton joined with Senators Jim Jeffords  Joe Lieberman  Frank Lautenberg and Barbara Boxer in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson calling on the agency to come clean on its methods for testing nationwide lead levels in drinking water and to immediate implement the GAO report s recommendations  including updating EPA s 1994 guidance on lead in drinking water in schools and non residential buildings
