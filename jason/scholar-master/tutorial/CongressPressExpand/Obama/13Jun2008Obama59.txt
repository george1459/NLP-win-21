   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Crisis in Zimbabwe   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Crisis in Zimbabwe Friday  June 13  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Michael Ortiz I remain deeply concerned about the crisis in Zimbabwe  where the government of Robert Mugabe last week banned the operations of humanitarian agencies working across the country   The regime s latest attempt to hold on to power at any cost has already accelerated the suffering of millions of Zimbabwe s citizens  Food and other assistance from international agencies including UNICEF  CARE  and Oxfam are critical to the survival of millions of Zimbabweans who cannot afford basic foodstuffs due to skyrocketing inflation and the government s disastrous economic mismanagement   The United Nations estimates that two million people now face starvation in a country that was once a breadbasket serving all of southern Africa  In this man made humanitarian crisis  the most vulnerable citizens children and AIDS patients have been hit the hardest  Robert Mugabe s government has frequently used food as a political weapon and required citizens to prove their membership in his ZANU PF party in order to receive aid  The government is at it once again  denying food donated to Zimbabwe s citizens by the international community  including the United States  to punish the Zimbabwean people for voting peacefully for change   This egregious abuse is part of a broader campaign of intimidation and repression designed to manipulate the results of the June 27 presidential run off elections   Members of the opposition  civil society activists  independent journalists and foreign diplomats have all been targets of harassment and brutality in recent weeks  This week s arrest and detention of senior MDC leaders is the most recent example of the government s determination to hang on to power at any cost  Governing means acting in the best interests of a nation and its people   Robert Mugabe has abandoned this fundamental responsibility  and continues to jeopardize the future of Zimbabwe s children while undermining the economic progress that has been achieved in southern Africa   I am pleased that African leaders  including Archbishop Desmond Tutu  Kofi Annan  former heads of states  business leaders and some of the continent s best and brightest artists and activists have called for an end to the violence and the ban on humanitarian aid operations  Urgent action is required to prevent a further deterioration of this tragic situation  The United Nations  the African Union and the Southern African Development Community cannot afford to be spectators to this tragedy  Along with the United States and Africa s other partners  they must speak out against repression in Zimbabwe   They should also swiftly deploy observers for the June 27th run off and demand that the Government of Zimbabwe immediately lift the ban on NGO operations before millions more suffer as victims of this crisis                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
