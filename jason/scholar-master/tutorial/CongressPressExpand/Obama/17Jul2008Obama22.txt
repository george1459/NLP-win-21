United States Senate  Committee on Appropriations      123 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran  The recent and extraordinary tornadoes  storms  and flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries have left many communities devastated in our states  While our first responders  state  and local governments are continuing their heroic effort to provide assistance to our citizens in these areas  our communities are still suffering from the huge losses to homes  businesses  and infrastructure caused by these storms   All of our states face the arduous task of rebuilding  As our state and local governments have begun to calculate their various losses and needs  it is clear that the magnitude of this disaster will require action from the federal government beyond the Stafford Act  Every time a region of our country has been affected by a major disaster we have come together to make sure states do not face disasters alone   These tornadoes  storms  and flooding have affected nine states across the central United States  While each state has unique types of damage  we have joined together in an attempt to ensure that the entire region is able to receive the assistance needed to come out of these disasters stronger  We need to make sure that FEMA  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  HUD  Commerce  USDA  DOL  DHHS  DOT  and other federal agencies have the necessary resources to save businesses  homes and lives  A robust disaster relief package is necessary to fund the costs that these agencies will incur in the recovery process  Our states have provided the Committee with very initial estimates of funds that will be needed  beyond what FEMA and the Stafford Act will cover  to begin this process  The Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program is especially important in this regard   We believe this program should provide grants for home repair or replacement  small businesses  and community infrastructure   We urge you to continue to work with us as you consider an additional Supplemental Appropriations measure to ensure critical funding and relief reaches the areas devastated by this disaster   Thank you for your attention to this important matter       Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
