Contact  Ben LaBolt  202  228 5511 Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in over 20 Years WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Norm Coleman  R MN  today reintroduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil      Setting America on a course towards energy independence will bolster our security  insulate our economy  and keep our environment livable     said Senator Obama      Now that President Bush agrees it is time to raise fuel economy standards  Congress must act to decrease our gasoline consumption and invest in the alternative fuels of the future          Energy is fundamentally reshaping the power balance in the world  largely to the detriment of the United States   The hundreds of billions of dollars spent on oil imports each year weakens the U S  economy  enriches hostile regimes  and is used by some to support terrorism   It is incomprehensible that fuel economy has been stagnant when the costs of oil dependence are so high   The 110th Congress must reform fuel economy standards as part of a comprehensive energy strategy that is in the interest of U S  national security     said Senator Lugar  Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee       If it was not clear before  it is now   domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy     said Senator Joseph R  Biden  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee     For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can   t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks          Consumers are demanding fuel efficient vehicles and I believe American ingenuity is up to the task     Senator Smith said      The proper mix of fuel economy standards and tax incentives can help auto manufactures roll out a durable and safe car  truck  or SUV   This is also a national security issue   We can   t keep buying oil from countries that use the profits to shoot bullets back at us            I am pleased to join my colleagues in again cosponsoring legislation that will improve vehicle fuel economy     Senator Specter said      This legislation will help the United States reduce our dependence on foreign oil and act as a responsible environmental steward by reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions          Improving vehicle fuel efficiency is an important step in helping reduce our country   s dependency on foreign oil   It   s time to investigate serious ways to improve fuel efficiency  and I believe this bill is a great start     Senator Bingaman  chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  said       Our addiction to foreign oil is a threat to both our economic and national security     said Senator Coleman     It   s time we take the decisions about our energy supply out of the hands of foreign nations  By coupling a sensible fuel efficiency standard that will push technology to the marketplace with strong tax incentives  we can put American on the road to energy independence      America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  As oil prices have exceeded  70 a barrel in recent years and with total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it   s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 4 percent     roughly one mile per gallon     each year   The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   The Fuel Economy Reform Act reflects the recommended approach of the Energy Security Leadership Council   s 2006 report on how to secure America   s energy future   This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised     In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year   If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028   The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   This Congress provides a window of opportunity to achieve fuel economy reform   President Bush signaled his commitment to lowering oil consumption  in part through fuel economy reform  in this year   s State of the Union Address   In December 2006  the Energy Security Leadership Council noted the Fuel Economy Reform Act as their recommended approach to secure America   s energy future       We need to act now if we want to prevent an even greater energy crisis in the future     said Obama     This bipartisan  common sense approach will finally harness the technology we already have to save Americans money at the pump and save America from a dependence on the world   s most unstable  undemocratic regimes          The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 A New Approach to Increasing CAFE Standards  A New Approach   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the logjam on establishing greater vehicle fuel economy by establishing a targeted 4 percent increase each year in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards   a rate that the National Academy of Sciences has determined is possible   unless the experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is technologically unachievable  cannot maintain overall fleet safety  or is not cost effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   Higher CAFE Standards   If the 4 percent per year target is met for ten years after the continuous provision improvements go into effect  this bill will save 1 3 million barrels of oil per day and 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year   If gasoline is just  2 50 per gallon  consumers will save  50 billion at the pump in 2018 alone  By 2028  Americans will have saved a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline and cut global warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases    Flexibility for Manufacturers  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also provides fairness and flexibility to domestic auto makers by establishing different standards for different types of cars   Currently manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars   The bill creates further flexibility by giving NHTSA the authority to allow companies to earn credit for improving fuel efficiency beyond the CAFE standard in one type of car  and using those credits to meet goals for other vehicle models   Because technological advances may affect manufacturers over time  the bill instructs the Energy Department  Environmental Protection Agency  and National Academy of Sciences  to study ways to reform the regulatory structure of this approach in 2016    Incentives for Fuel Economy  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced technology vehicles  this legislation provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants   This will strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles   The bill would lift the current 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more Americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles   The Problem    America is Addicted to Foreign Oil   America   s 20 million barrel a day habit costs our economy  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually   We use 8 million barrels of oil each day on passenger vehicles   Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue   Oil recently has reached as high as  75 a barrel and  3 00 a gallon at the pump  during the next 20 years total US petroleum demand will increase 23 percent   CAFE   Initial Success Followed by 20 Years of Little Progress   In response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s  Congress enacted CAFE standards  the first ever requirements for gas mileage   NHTSA raised the average gas mileage of cars and trucks from just over 14 miles per gallon  mpg  in 1976 to 27 5 mpg for cars and 20 7 mpg for trucks by 1985   By enacting these standards  the country saves approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day  making it the most successful energy saving measure ever adopted   Unfortunately  since 1985 the NHTSA has been largely unable to increase standards   The CAFE standard for cars has remained frozen at 27 5 mpg for 20 years   The standard for trucks only increased by 2 mpg to 22 2 mpg for 2007   Over those 20 years  the auto industry has developed numerous innovations  which allowed fuel economy standards to rise to 45 miles per gallon in Japan   Congressional Deadlock   Since 1985  Congress has considered numerous bills to increase fuel efficiency  without significant gains in CAFE standards   Recently  there has been a logjam between those who want Congress to mandate specific increases in CAFE standards  and those who want the rate of improvement to be determined by NHTSA   This approach ensures a rate of improvement of 4 percent annually and allows NHTSA to adjust that rate
