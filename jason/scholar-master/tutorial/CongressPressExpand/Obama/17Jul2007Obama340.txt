Obama Statement on Visit of Polish President Lech Kaczynski Monday  July 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the visit of Polish President Lech Kaczynski to the United States       I welcome Polish President Lech Kaczynski to Washington   Recognizing the rich history of cooperation between our two countries  I am happy to say  Witam Serdecznie w Washingtonie  Welcome to Washington           The Polish President s visit reminds us that for the last 200 years America and Poland have been linked in the struggle for freedom   Today there is a strong legacy of sacrifice between the two nations     sacrifice for the cause of American and Polish freedom alike          As early as the Revolutionary War  Polish patriots like Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko fought alongside American patriots     from Germantown to Saratoga     to help win our country   s independence          During World War I  Ignacy Paderewski  an unparalleled musician  helped lead the fight for a free and independent Poland   He became Prime Minister after the war  only to be forced into exile by the Nazi Occupation   After he died in exile in the United States  America gave this great friend of freedom a place alongside our honored dead in Arlington National Cemetery  There he would rest  in the words of President Franklin Roosevelt     until Poland would be free             It was a moving sight when  in 1992  President George H  W  Bush escorted Paderewski s ashes home to Poland   No one will forget seeing thousands of Poles lining the streets over the miles from the airport to the city center  waiting to see the horse drawn carriage          It was the world   s good fortune that a Pole infused with this same dedication to freedom and the dignity of all people was elected Pope at such a critical time   Polish Americans were thrilled at the election of Karol Wojtyla as Pope  a man who kept the faith when faith was forbidden          At the same time  American Polonia   s dedication to freedom in their native Poland was vital in ensuring that Soviet totalitarianism would not succeed   Millions of personal packages were sent to friends and family back home  and each package was a message of hope in dark days     like the imposition of Martial Law in 1981     of the Soviet Union          The razing of the Iron Curtain provided opportunities to renew the linkage between Poland and America   Two centuries after the deaths of Pulaski and Kosciuszko  Poland and America became formal allies in NATO  institutionalizing the faith in freedom our countries have shared for centuries          Since joining NATO in 1997  Poland has become one of America   s most important strategic partners  dedicating troops and resources to our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq          We now have an opportunity to build on this long and deep relationship   Here is how we can      1  Renew the unity of purpose of the Transatlantic Relationship      The Bush Administration s policy of splitting Europe into    old    and    new    was not just wrong  it was counterproductive   Poland should not have to choose between its vital interest in closer integration with Europe and its alliance with the United States   America must repair its relationship with Europe as a whole  so that Poland and our other Central European allies are never put in that position again      2  Finish building a Europe whole and free      Poland has been a steadfast champion of liberty in the countries to its east   America and Poland should stand together to help Ukraine build a strong and stable democracy  and to help the people of Belarus regain their human rights   We also share an interest in working with Russia to meet common security threats and to encourage Russia   s integration into Western institutions   But we should also embrace  not abandon  those in Russia working to preserve their hard won liberty  and draw clear lines against Russia   s intimidation of its neighbors   21st Century Europe cannot be divided into 19th Century spheres of influence     3  Meet global challenges together       Not long ago  we looked to Poland as a country that needed American help in its own efforts to be free and secure  now we look to Poland as a critical partner in building a safer  freer world    We should work with Poland to secure more European troops  with stronger rules of engagement  to stabilize Afghanistan   And we should work together to send an unmistakable signal to Iran that its insistence in pursuing a nuclear weapons program is a profound mistake      4  Energize the alliance to confront new challenges      From Poland to the United States  we are facing a new kind of threat     in the form of energy insecurity and climate change   The North Atlantic community has always joined forces to confront and defeat new challenges  and we should be doing the same now by  among other things  sharing best practices on energy conservation  inviting India and China to join the International Energy Agency  and dedicating our significant resources to establishing a global cap and trade on greenhouse gas pollution      5  Prudently but decisively prepare for emerging threats      The Bush Administration has been developing plans to deploy interceptors and radar systems in Poland and the Czech Republic as part of a missile defense system designed to protect against the potential threat of Iranian nuclear armed missiles   If we can responsibly deploy missile defenses that would protect us and our allies we should     but only when the system works   We need to make sure any missile defense system would be effective before deployment   The Bush Administration has in the past exaggerated missile defense capabilities and rushed deployments for political purposes  The Bush Administration has also done a poor job of consulting its NATO allies about the deployment of a missile defense system that has major implications for all of them   We must not allow this issue to divide    new Europe    and    old Europe     as the Bush Administration tried to do over Iraq       6  Invite Poland to join the Visa Waiver Program      We should work to include countries like Poland that are members of both the EU and NATO into the Visa Waiver Program   Today   s visa regime reflects neither the current strategic relationship nor the close historic bonds between our peoples  and is out of date         These are important steps  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to implement them          It is wonderful to welcome the Polish President at a time in which America and Poland share the same freedom   Our two nations share a common legacy and destiny  and I am honored to welcome President Kaczynski to Washington
