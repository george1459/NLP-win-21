legislative action  restrict HHS funding if list not provided within one week WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael Leavitt to release the list of the 128    special focus  facilities  the list of worst performing nursing homes in the country  Recent press accounts have reported that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services refuses to make the list of underperforming nursing homes public  but has shared the information with lobbyists who represent the nursing home industry  Obama has requested HHS make this information public immediately and stop withholding this information from America   s seniors and their families   If Secretary Leavitt does not comply  Obama has promised to take legislative action  below is a copy of the letter  December 6  2007 The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC  20201 Dear Secretary Leavitt  I am writing to express my serious objections to the withholding of critical information about nursing home conditions from America   s senior citizens  An estimated 1 5 million residents live in approximately 16 000 nursing homes in the United States   This year  federal  state  and local governments will spend  82 billion on nursing home care  of which  56 5 billion will come from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid   All nursing homes that receive federal funding are subject to federal regulation and annual inspections   Under federal law  these inspections are a matter of public record and are made available to nursing home residents and their family members  and summaries of the inspection reports are posted on your department   s Nursing Home Compare website  www medicare gov NHCompare   These federal inspection and public disclosure requirements ensure that nursing home residents are receiving the high quality of care that they deserve   Given the importance of protecting one of our nation   s most vulnerable populations  I was disturbed to learn that your department is withholding information about some of the worst performing nursing homes in the country    According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has compiled a list of 128    special focus facilities        that are among the worst performing nursing homes in the country   These facilities are ones that have consistently been cited for serious violations of health and safety regulations     violations such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  pressure sores  serious neglect  and physical abuse   If these violations are not corrected  the facility could be subject to penalties and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs    However  of the 128 worst performing facilities  only 54 of these nursing homes have been publicly identified  one of these facilities is in my home state of Illinois  1   The remaining 74 facilities have not been disclosed to the public  even though this information would be invaluable not only to current residents of those facilities but also to potential residents and their family members   It is incomprehensible why the complete list of 128 facilities     which is determined on the basis of publicly available inspection reports     would not be made public  Although the names of the 128    special focus facilities        have not been made available to the public  press accounts suggest that the complete list has been provided to the American Health Care Association  the main lobbying organization for the nursing home industry   Providing information about poorly performing nursing homes to the lobbyists who represent those facilities  and not to the senior citizens who would most benefit from this information  is outrageous and yet another example of how this Administration has placed the corporate interest before the public interest  I call on you to immediately release the names of all 128    special focus facilities          If you refuse to do so  I will pursue all possible legislative actions to compel the release of this information   Please notify my office by Thursday  December 13  2007  as to whether you will comply with this request    Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator   1  Although press accounts indicate that the names of 54 facilities have been made public  the list posted on the HHS website only includes information about 52 facilities                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
