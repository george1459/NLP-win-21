      Statement of Senator Barack Obama on International Human Rights Day Monday  December 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC    The following statement was submitted by U  S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  in the Congressional Record today on International Human Rights Day      Mr  President  today is Human Rights Day  Fifty nine years ago today  thanks in large measure to the tireless leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt  the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      The principles encompassed in the Declaration are uniquely rooted in the American tradition  beginning with our founding documents  Yet the Declaration also wove together a remarkable variety of political  religious  and cultural perspectives and traditions  The United States and the United Kingdom championed civil liberties  The French representative on the committee helped devise the structure of the Declaration  India added the prohibition on discrimination  China stressed the importance of family and reminded UN delegates that every right carried with it companion duties  Today should be a day of celebration  a day when we hail the universality of these core principles  which are both beacons to guide us and the foundations for building a more just and stable world        The Universal Declaration was a radical document in its time  and its passage required courageous leadership from political leaders  Even though no country could have been said to be in full compliance with its provisions  including the United States where Jim Crow still prevailed  all UN member states committed themselves to promoting  protecting  and respecting fundamental human rights  Although Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not live to see the enactment of the historic Declaration  it enshrined his    four freedoms       freedom from want  freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and freedom from fear  Individuals in the United States and everywhere else were entitled  simply by virtue of being human  to physical and economic security  The Declaration was born of the recognition  in the words of one human rights scholar  that    what is pain and humiliation for you is pain and humiliation for me           Anniversaries are a good time to examine how faithful we have been to our own aspirations     to ask ourselves how well we are measuring up  to assess whether our practice lives up to our promise  We in the United States enjoy tremendous freedoms  but we also carry a special responsibility     the responsibility of being the country so many people in the world look to  just as they did in Mrs  Roosevelt   s day  for human rights leadership        Today  on this anniversary  we must acknowledge both bad news and good news  The bad news is that for nearly seven years  President Bush has ignored Franklin Roosevelt s wise counsel about the corrosive effects of fear  Indeed  instead of urging us to reject fear  he has stoked false fear and undermined our values        Wounded by a horrific terrorist attack  we were warned that Saddam Hussein     a man who had nothing to do with that attack     could unleash mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs  We were told that waterboarding was effective  We were assured that shipping men off to countries that tortured was good for national security  We were led to believe that our military and civilian courts were inadequate  and so we established a network of unaccountable prisons  And the Administration launched secret wiretapping initiatives  scoffed at the rule of law  and flaunted the will of the Congress          Nonetheless  in his second inaugural  President Bush rightly proclaimed     America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one     But  tragically  he has failed to heed his own words   We have not only vacated the perch of moral leader  we have also compounded the threat we face  spurring more people to take up arms against us       The further bad news is that other countries have not stepped up to fill the void left by our lack of moral leadership  The hundreds of thousands killed and two million displaced by the genocide in Darfur  the shell shocked Buddhist monks in Burma  the political opposition in Zimbabwe  the imprisoned independent journalists in Russia  the brave human rights lawyers and judges in Pakistan     they do not know where to turn internationally  Human rights abusers win seats on the UN Human Rights Council  the International Criminal Court issues war crimes indictments  but no country steps up to enforce them  the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations begs in vain for troops  helicopters and police to help stave off humanitarian catastrophes  For all these reasons  the world needs renewed  principled U S  leadership       There is another critical reason why America must again provide moral leadership on human rights  the fate of women around the world  Whether it is in creating wealth  access to capital  and property rights  or receiving quality education  health care  and social services  women still lag far behind men   And of course the lack of full reproductive rights can be a matter of life and death for too many women  Inequality means insecurity for women  especially those who comprise 70 percent of the world   s poorest  There is a clear link between discrimination and violence against women  equality and empowerment of women is the most effective approach to ending violence against women  Today  violent acts against women  in the words of UNICEF     are the most pervasive violation of human rights in the world today           Women   s inequality and the persistent prevalence of honor killings  trafficking  repression  and sexual assault nearly six decades after the Universal Declaration shame us all  One need only look to Saudi Arabia  where a 19 year old woman  who was raped  instead of receiving treatment and support  was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for riding in a car with a non related male   In the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Darfur  rape is routinely used as a weapon of war by militia and government forces   In northern Uganda  young girls are given as    prizes    to older male soldiers to reward performance        In Pakistan  international observers report that one of the largest challenges facing its next election is guaranteeing women enough security so they can leave their homes to vote  In Iraq the militarization and rise of radical Islam has eroded women   s rights  In Afghanistan  while nothing can compare to the day when the Taliban ruled the entire country  women throughout that country complain that their freedoms have been woefully curtailed  The United States alone cannot solve the problem of women s suffering and gender inequality around the world  but with new  principled leadership  the United States can elevate women s economic  political and social development to the top of our international agenda and ensure that women around the world know that they have a reliable friend and partner in America      Let me close by saying that the very depth of the anti Americanism felt around the world today is a testament not to hatred but to disappointment  acute disappointment  The global public expects more from America  They expect our government to embody what they have seen in our people  industriousness  humanity  generosity  and a commitment to equality  We can become that country again                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be
