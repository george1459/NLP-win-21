      Obama Introduces Bill to Create National Emergency Volunteer Corps Thursday  September  8  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 8  2005  Obama Introduces Bill to Create National Emergency Volunteer Corps   Washington   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Hurricane Katrina Emergency Workforce Act of 2005  which would create a national emergency health professional volunteer corps to ensure there is a ready pool of volunteer doctors and nurses who are willing  trained  and certified to serve in times of disaster  In a letter to President Bush  Obama also requested that the President take all necessary steps to expedite the process by which volunteer medical personnel can be deployed to areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina and areas where evacuees have been relocated    Although we live in a changing and uncertain world  one constant remains  whether it be earthquakes  hurricanes  tornadoes  or sadly even terrorist attacks  the nation will surely face future devastating and cataclysmic events   Obama said    We know now that the nation s preparedness for such events in no way matches our ability to respond and mitigate human suffering and economic collapse     Obama s bill would create a national emergency health professional volunteer corps so that there is a ready pool of volunteer doctors and nurses who are willing  trained  and certified to serve in times of disaster  In addition to creating this volunteer pool of professionals  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  would also be required to create a database of names and contact information of these volunteer health professionals so that they can be quickly called upon in a time of need  Lastly  the bill would provide liability protections to qualified health professionals and provide job protections to medical personnel who choose to volunteer to help in relief efforts     We have all watched TV reports of residents stranded  abandoned really  without food or water and medical care  while too many doctors who wanted to help were powerless to do so because they got caught in a web of bureaucratic red tape   Obama said   This bill will guarantee that America is never caught unprepared to help those who need it the most     Please find the full text of the letter below        September 8  2005     The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  Washington  DC  20500     Dear President Bush      I am writing to ask you to take all necessary steps to expedite the process by which volunteer medical personnel can be deployed to areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina and areas where evacuees have been relocated      When I was in Houston earlier this week with former Presidents Bush and Clinton  I met countless hurricane evacuees with heart wrenching stories about the lack of medical care at the Superdome and New Orleans Convention Center   Although these people all expressed relief at the dramatically improved conditions at the Reliant Center  many were worried about the sick and elderly left behind at the makeshift hospital inside of the New Orleans airport   Many were also concerned about whether they would be able to receive adequate medical care while staying at temporary shelters in Houston      I understand that the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has issued an urgent request for medical volunteers  including paramedics and mental health workers to respond to the needs of the sick  and morticians to respond to the recovery of those lives already lost in this disaster   And  an update published by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on Tuesday stated that Louisiana requires 100 mental health professionals for screening  counseling  and tracking of post traumatic stress disorders      The federal government should be doing everything possible to streamline the process by which trained medical personnel around the country can volunteer their services in Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama  and any of the states where evacuees have been relocated   Indeed  I have heard from many medical personnel in Illinois who were eager to travel to these states to provide assistance       Unfortunately  my office has received numerous complaints from volunteer doctors that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  did not return their phone calls  did not have information on how they could volunteer  or simply referred them to local authorities who were not able to help them   Doctors who attempted to volunteer their services on the HHS website encountered significant difficulties as well   Such a lack of information and responsiveness is shocking during a time of emergency       Given the urgent need to get medical personnel to affected areas as soon as possible  I am writing to request that you direct DHS  FEMA  HHS  and all other relevant agencies to work with the Red Cross and hospitals in affected areas to eliminate any bureaucratic obstacles preventing much needed services from getting to hurricane victims   This includes providing more detailed information to the medical profession about how they can volunteer their services  better coordination of volunteer doctors and nurses with the Red Cross and local hospitals  and waivers of liability for volunteer medical professionals       The health of too many people remains at risk  and bureaucratic red tape and run arounds should not prevent these people from getting the help they need      Sincerely      Barack Obama  United States Senator
