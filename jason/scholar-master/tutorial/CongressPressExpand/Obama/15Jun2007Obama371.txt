   Bayh  Obama Introduce Legislation To Reduce Barriers to Responsible Fatherhood   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Bayh  Obama Introduce Legislation To Reduce Barriers to Responsible Fatherhood Friday  June 15  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Eric Kleiman  Bayh  or Ben LaBolt  Obama    Senators say men must take responsibility for raising their children   Washington  D C      U S  Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation to encourage more men to take responsibility for their children and to address the challenges faced by millions of American families as a result of the national epidemic of absentee fathers   In the last 40 years  the number of children without fathers in America has more than quadrupled  from 5 million in 1960 to more than 24 million today  An estimated 40 percent of the children who live in fatherless households have not seen their fathers in at least one year  Studies show that children without fathers in their lives are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime  nine times more likely to drop out of school  and 20 times more likely to end up in prison  They also are more likely to have behavioral problems  to run away from home  and to become teenage parents themselves   The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 removes government penalties on married families and offers support for fathers trying to do the right thing while cracking down on men who avoid their parental responsibilities  The bill would provide fathers with innovative job training services and other economic opportunities  while expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to help non custodial parents trying to support their families  It would also increase child support enforcement by helping governments collect a projected  13 billion in payments from those who don   t fulfill their parental responsibilities   The Bayh Obama legislation would help ensure that money paid for child support goes directly to children and their mothers and does not result in loss of food assistance for eligible families  It would also strengthen domestic violence prevention services       Conceiving a child doesn   t make you a man  but raising one responsibly does     Bayh said     Fatherlessness is an issue many politicians would prefer to avoid  but elected officials have a moral obligation not to sit idly by while communities crumble because of the epidemic of absentee fathers  I am not na  ve enough to believe that government alone can solve this problem  but together we can play a constructive role in crafting policies that attack the root causes of this epidemic  Fatherless children are more likely to do poorly in school and have emotional and behavioral problems  They are more likely to commit crimes  smoke cigarettes  and abuse drugs and alcohol  Many of our most pressing societal ills can be addressed by tackling the fatherhood crisis effectively          As fathers  we need to teach our boys what makes you a man is not just having a child  it   s having the courage to raise a child     Obama said     Congress can make it easier for those who make that responsible choice   and make it harder for those who avoid it  This legislation will provide support for fathers who are trying to do the right thing in making child support payments by providing them with job training and job opportunities and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit  It stops penalizing marriage in the tax code and makes sure that children and families  not the government  receive every penny of child support  It would also crack down on those who avoid their responsibility by increasing child support enforcement  a measure that will collect nearly  13 billion in payments that can help raise  nurture  and educate children      In the U S  House of Representatives  companion legislation is being introduced by Congresswoman Julia Carson  D IN  and Congressman Danny Davis  D IL        This is good legislation for families across Indiana and America     Carson said     It sends a message to our men that  once you become a parent  you have a responsibility to that child and we   re going to hold you accountable  but we   re also going to provide you the tools for success   The role a father plays in the life of a child is invaluable  and it   s heartbreaking to consider that almost 25 million kids in this country grow up without a father in their lives   This legislation will take steps toward changing that          This bill is a key component of a fresh approach to family support  one which supports and strengthens families before they are at risk     Davis said     This legislation provides the tools to strengthen relationships between fathers and their children and encourages fathers to become good nurturers and providers  The fullest positive participation by fathers helps to create a caring environment capable of fostering optimal child development  promotes humanistic cultural and community traditions while reducing poverty  teenage pregnancies  juvenile delinquency and incidents of child abuse and neglect  In the process of assuming responsibility for fatherhood  fathers themselves acquire new self confidence  new parenting skills  higher educational accomplishments and greater economic independence      Last year  Congress passed legislation based on a proposal introduced by Senator Bayh that provided up to  50 million each year for the next five years in funding for responsible fatherhood programs nationwide as part of the spending reconciliation bill
