Durbin and Obama joined a bipartisan group of twelve senators from six Midwestern states in asking for supplemental funding that will enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency  the Army Corps of Engineers  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the Department of Commerce  the Department of Agriculture  the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies to access the necessary resources to deliver critical relief to the affected areas as soon as possible  text of letter below   June 18  2008  The Honorable Ed Schafer  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Ave   S W   Washington  DC 20250   Dear Secretary Schafer  We write to request your assistance in responding to the severe flooding in Illinois that has occurred over the past two weeks and an opportunity to meet with you to discuss this issue   Though experts continue to assess the extent of the impact  it s clear that the recent flood waters have caused substantial damage  inundating farmland and destroying rural homes  businesses  and facilities   The floods of 1993 floods incurred more than  15 billion in damage    It s likely that the recent flooding will result in reduced yields in Illinois and significant losses to Illinois  agriculture industry   Because many of our growers planted their crops only days or weeks before the flooding began  crops were highly vulnerable to adverse weather conditions   Many fields of corn  soybean  wheat  and hay have been deluged and crops have been lost   The same is true of acreage planted to specialty crops and certain varieties of fruit trees   Lastly  the timing of the flooding has prevented many growers from entering their fields to plant this year s crop   If wet weather conditions continue to persist  some growers may not be able to plant or re plant a crop in time   The threat to Illinois farmland has only increased in recent days  with levees overtopping in Mercer  Henderson  and Adams counties that protect significant amounts of agricultural lands  Beyond the effects on agriculture  the flooding has devastated communities and damaged homes  businesses  and critical public infrastructure in rural parts of Illinois   As floodwaters begin to recede in other parts of the Midwest  water levels in Illinois along the Mississippi River are expected to crest this week near or above the records set by the devastating floods in 1993   Due to existing damage from rising floodwaters and in anticipation of the widespread damage expected this week  Governor Blagojevich has issued state disaster declarations for Adams  Calhoun  Clark  Coles  Crawford  Cumberland  Douglas  Hancock  Henderson  Jasper  Jersey  Knox  Lake  Lawrence  Madison  Mercer  Pike  Rock Island and Winnebago counties    Unfortunately  the predicted impact of this flooding is greater than the capacity of state or local governments to respond to a disaster of this size   Therefore  we request that you make the necessary declarations to ensure that our producers and rural communities have access to all appropriate sources of federal disaster assistance   In addition  we ask that you compile a list of programs that producers and rural communities may be eligible for  including the Risk Management Agency  RMA  Prevented Planning Program  Farm Service Agency  FSA  Disaster Assistance Programs  and Rural Housing  Community Facilities  and Businesses Emergency Relief  Lastly  we ask that you meet with us in the near future to discuss damage assessments and options available to our communities   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this urgent request and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate                                     Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
