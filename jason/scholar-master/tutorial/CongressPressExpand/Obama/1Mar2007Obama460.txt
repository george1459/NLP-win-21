   Obama  McCaskill Introduce Legislation To Improve Military Hospitals   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Introduce Legislation To Improve Military Hospitals Thursday  March  1  2007  WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Barack Obama and Claire McCaskill today introduced the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  legislation that would cut red tape  improve facilities  and increase oversight at our nation   s military hospitals   Below is Senator Obama   s statement on the introduction of the legislation  Last week  the nation learned of the serious problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center including decaying  cockroach infested facilities and an overwhelmed patient care bureaucracy   As described in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Dana Priest and Anne Hull  wounded soldiers are returning home from the battle in Iraq only to face a new battle to get the care and benefits they have earned   These stories should not have come as a complete surprise to those who have followed the issue closely   We have long known that troops returning from battle face numerous bureaucratic hurdles when they get home   That   s why I introduced legislation last year to smooth the transition from active duty to civilian life  The Lane Evans Bill expands and improves electronic medical records  face to face physical exams  better tracking of veterans  and other approaches to make life easier for returning veterans   However  the stories out of Walter Reed last week did shock my conscience because  like many Senators  I have made the half hour trek from the Capitol to visit Walter Reed  And I saw what the Army wanted the world to see  a shining world class facility where the wounded can heal with state of the art care   I never saw mold growing on the walls  or broken elevators  or the lack of adequate support for soldiers and their families   Walter Reed was supposed to be the flagship of military health care  Instead it has become an emblem of much that is wrong with the system  and a harbinger of more severe problems that may be hiding at other military hospitals and facilities that are not in the spotlight   The problems at Walter Reed stem from complex causes  the most important of which is that the military and VA have not yet prepared for the growing flood of casualties from the Iraq war    Our injured troops did not hesitate to fight for us on the battlefield     we shouldn   t make them fight again at home in order to receive the care they deserve  That is why Senator McCaskill and I are introducing the bipartisan Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act today  The bill will fix the problems at Walter Reed and improve care at our military hospitals and facilities   Our bill would fix deplorable conditions at outpatient residence facilities by setting high standards and increasing accountability   Under this bipartisan measure  the standards will be clear  First  recovering soldiers    rooms will be as good or better as the best standard rooms for active duty troops  Second  our injured heroes will not have to wait more than two weeks for maintenance problems to be repaired  Third  we will have zero tolerance for pest infestations  And finally  emergency medical personnel and crisis counselors will be available to recovering troops 24 hours a day   The bill also tackles accountability problems  In the days following the Post stories  the Army vice chief of staff  and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs both said they were surprised by conditions at Walter Reed and directed blame on lower ranking officers and noncommissioned officers   I also read in the Army Times that soldiers at Walter Reed have been warned not to talk to the media  Under our bill  we won   t have to rely on the media to inform the Congress and the American people of the conditions at military hospitals   It requires that the Inspector General inspect facilities twice a year and report conditions to high level officials and the public   Under our bill  military leaders will no longer be able to use the excuse that they didn   t know conditions on the ground   When injured servicemembers return home  they along with their family members face a mountain of paperwork and bureaucracy   From the moment a doctor determines a soldier may be unable to return to duty  it takes an average of 209 days for the military to figure out what to do with the soldier   The system is broken  and soldiers and their families are the ones who pay the price    Our bill addresses this problem by bringing the far flung parts of the military   s Physical Disability Evaluation System  PDES  under one roof in each branch of the military   It also puts much of the system online so that caseworkers and service members can manage their documents electronically   Today  students can apply to go to law school or business school online  without ever having to touch a piece of paper   Navigating the Pentagon bureaucracy should be that easy   Our bill also calls for injury specific procedures so that the most severely injured servicemembers can skip unnecessary steps  There   s no reason why a soldier with a gunshot injury to the spine should face the same procedural hurdles in order to prove his injury was service related as a soldier with less severe injuries   At the same time  nothing in our bill will prevent those service members who wish to stay in the military from appealing decisions   Our bill also helps soldiers and their families navigate the PDES system with new hotlines  manuals  and an ombudsman to help answer questions   Another problem at Walter Reed is casework  The caseworkers are doing amazing work helping soldiers schedule medical appointments  prepare paperwork  and obtain their everyday needs   However  the caseworkers are overwhelmed  Some have to care for 50 or more recovering soldiers at a time  more than double the ideal ratio   The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act fixes this problem by forcing the Pentagon to work with each military hospital to set the ideal ratio of caseworkers to patients based on the particular needs of that facility   In the interim  our bill requires a temporary ratio of 1 caseworker for every 20 recovering service members  This will push the Pentagon to begin hiring and training caseworkers right away   This legislation also provides important new support for family members who often have to endure economic and emotional hardship to accompany their loved one through the recovery process and the currently flawed PDES process   It clarifies that non medical attendees and family members on invitational orders may receive medical care and mental health counseling while caring for injured loved ones at military facilities   It extends employment and job placement training services to family members   And most important  this bipartisan legislation provides federal protections against a family member on invitational orders being fired   I think we can all agree that a mother should never have to choose between caring for a wounded son or daughter and keeping her job   Secretary Gates promised a thorough investigation by outside experts and accountability for those responsible  Our bill builds on that model by establishing an Oversight Board of outside experts to review the Pentagon   s progress in implementing this bill  The Board would be appointed by Congress and the executive branch and be made up of veterans  wounded soldiers  family members and experts on military medicine   The Oversight Board will be an important check to make sure the Defense Department is following through to care for recovering troops   We cannot move fast enough to make sure our wounded troops are getting the care they need   No cost is too great  We must pass the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act quickly and follow up with the adequate resources to ensure the men and women recovering at military hospitals across the world get the best care we can offer
