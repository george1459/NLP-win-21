   Obama Joins Levin and Coleman to Introduce Bill to Stop Misuse of U S  Companies   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Levin and Coleman to Introduce Bill to Stop Misuse of U S  Companies Thursday  May  1  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                          Contacts  Tara Andringa  Levin   LeRoy Coleman  Coleman   or Michael Ortiz  Obama   WASHINGTON   Today Senator Carl Levin  D Mich    Senator Norm Coleman  R Minn    and Senator Barack Obama  D Ill    Chairman  Ranking Minority Member  and Member of the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  introduced the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act to help law enforcement stop the misuse of U S  corporations  Currently  nearly two million corporations and limited liability companies  LLCs  are formed within the United States each year   The States generally form these corporations without asking for the identity of the corporation s beneficial owners  and numerous law enforcement problems have resulted when some of these corporations have become involved with money laundering  tax evasion  or other misconduct   The bill being introduced would require the States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations formed under their laws and to provide access to this information to law enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons    Criminals are hiding behind U S  corporations while committing all sorts of crimes   from terrorism to money laundering  fraud  and tax evasion   said Levin    Law enforcement has told us for years that they need the names of the true owners behind a corporation to find out who is responsible for the illicit activity  but they can t get it  because the States don t bother to ask   The bill we are introducing today will strike a blow against corporate secrecy  strengthen law enforcement  and curb the misuse of U S  corporations       Criminal activities that exploit the lack of transparency in U S  corporation registrations are more costly than ever   said Coleman   As our work on the Subcommittee has shown again and again  law enforcement has been frustrated by the ability of money launderers and tax cheats to hide behind privately held corporations and LLCs   This bill will shed light on these illegal activities  in a fair and reasonable manner that does not burden the states with an unfunded mandate and protects individual privacy     It is unacceptable for American companies to be used by criminals and terrorists as shields for tax evasion  terror financing  and financial crimes   said Obama    We must ensure our law enforcement agencies have the ability to properly investigate any financial criminal wrongdoing   This important legislation promotes transparency  fairness  and public safety  and sheds light on the people behind corporate entities so that criminal and terrorist activities can be deterred or detected more effectively   The Subcommittee has been pursuing this issue since 2000  when Levin requested the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct an investigation into an individual who set up over 2 000 Delaware shell companies and then established bank accounts for those companies  without revealing their identities  moving  1 4 billion dollars through the bank accounts   In April 2006  the GAO prepared another report in response to a Levin Coleman request entitled   Company Formations  Minimal Ownership Information Is Collected and Available    This GAO report reviewed the legal requirements in all 50 states to set up corporations and LLCs  found that most states failed to request beneficial ownership information  and reported that the absence of this ownership information impeded law enforcement investigations of suspect corporations  In November 2006  the Subcommittee held a hearing in which the GAO report was released  and officials from the Department of Justice  DOJ   the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   and the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  FinCEN  testified about an increase in the use of U S  shell companies for illicit activities  and the problems caused by the lack of beneficial ownership information   The Subcommittee has collected numerous examples of these law enforcement problems  including the following  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  reported that a Nevada based corporation received more than 3 700 suspicious wire transfers totaling  81 million over 2 years   The case was not prosecuted  however  because ICE was unable to identify the corporation s owners     FinCEN found that  between April 1996 and January 2004  financial institutions filed 397 suspicious activity reports  involving a total of almost  4 billion  U S  shell companies  East European countries  and U S  bank accounts      The Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  reported that U S  shell companies are being used to launder as much as  36 billion from the former Soviet Union   The FBI also reported that they have 103 open cases investigating market manipulation  most of which involve U S  shell companies      The IRS described a scheme involving three individuals who set up U S  shell companies to conceal nearly  9 million in taxable income in secret accounts in the Turks and Caicos Islands and other foreign countries      DOJ reported that Russian officials used shell companies in Pennsylvania and Delaware to unlawfully divert  15 million in international aid intended to upgrade the safety of former Soviet nuclear power plants      On April 22  2008  in response to a written question by Senator Levin  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote    In countless investigations  where the criminal targets utilize shell corporations  the lack of law enforcement s ability to gain access to true beneficial ownership information slows  confuses or impedes the efforts by investigators to follow criminal proceeds       In July 2006  the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering  which is the leading international organization combating money laundering  issued a report criticizing the United States for failing to comply with a FATF standard requiring beneficial ownership information to be obtained and urging the United States to correct this deficiency by July 2008    In response  the United States has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership information for the corporations and LLCs formed under their laws   The States  however  have not changed their incorporation practices    U S  corporations are getting a bad name  not only because they are being used to commit crimes  but because U S  law enforcement can t find out who owns them   said Levin    Right now  a person forming a U S  corporation typically provides less information to a State than is needed to obtain a bank account or driver s license   That doesn t make sense  and it invites misuse of U S  corporations   It s time for the United States to meet its international anti money laundering commitments  and that means getting beneficial ownership information for U S  corporations   All 27 countries in the European Union are already required to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations they form                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
