   Obama Calls for Increased Cafe Standards  Updated RFS in Energy Bill   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Calls for Increased Cafe Standards  Updated RFS in Energy Bill Monday  November 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 224 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  calling on them to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards and expand Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  in the comprehensive energy bill currently being negotiated in the House and Senate   The leaders have said they will send an energy bill to President Bush by the end of this year    In October  Obama joined Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  to introduce legislation to immediately update the RFS to require the production of 18 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2016 including 3 billion gallons of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol   This legislation recognizes the need for prompt action to update these renewable fuel requirements to provide market certainty to small  local  and farmer owned ethanol producers   Obama has also been a leader in the Senate in pushing for higher CAFE standards  introducing bipartisan bills in both 2006 and 2007  The text of the letter is below  Dear Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi  I strongly support your joint efforts to send a comprehensive energy bill to the President before the end of the year   As oil prices edge toward  100 a barrel and the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change become more evident every day  your leadership on this issue is needed and greatly appreciated  Both chambers passed energy bills earlier this year that would decrease our nation   s dependence on imported oil and reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change   Of particular importance are the enactment of a meaningful increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards and an extension and update of the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  which  together  constitute an essential foundation for the achievement of these critical national objectives   Stricter fuel efficiency standards will result in the reduction of carbon emissions   And the promotion of biofuels usage will allow us to meet those standards quicker and with clean burning  renewable  home grown fuel  With regard to CAFE  raising those fuel efficiency standards by 4  annually up to 40 mpg by 2020 could save Americans a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline  while cutting warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases by 2028   That analysis provides some perspective on the progress that can be made if Congress summons the political will to act boldly  As for the RFS  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated the use of 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the national gasoline supply by 2012   Two years later  production is now projected to reach 12 billion gallons by the end of 2008   But as ethanol usage passes the congressionally mandated  annual RFS targets  the major oil companies lose any incentive to use more renewable fuels in their supplies or to make higher ethanol blends like E85 available at their service stations   As a result of the renewable fuels industry   s productivity and the petroleum industry   s intransigence  the average national ethanol price on the spot market has plunged 30  in the last six months    The consequences of this development for our dual goals of reducing carbon emissions and displacing fossil fuels are severe   The ethanol industry has been suspending construction starts and facing significant cash flow problems in the face of declining prices   And large multinational corporations have responded by talking publicly about acquiring failing community sized ethanol plants at bargain basement prices  thereby consolidating their position in the industry and increasing their ability to control prices  This clearly hurts farmers and the rural economy   It is also not good for the environment   If current trends continue  the infant cellulosic biomass industry will likely see capital investment falter just when it is needed for the commercialization of developing  higher risk technologies   And finally  the consumer is hurt if we don   t break this policy logjam  as increased availability of domestic ethanol supplies has been proven to reduce gasoline prices at the pump    The Senate passed energy bill anticipated this problem and updated RFS targets to 15 billion gallons by 2015 and 36 billion by 2022   Until those updated levels are enacted  we risk stalling further development of the existing biofuels industry and jeopardizing timely investment in next generation cellulosic fuels from non food sources   I have always felt that higher fuel efficiency standards and the renewable fuels standard together are key to reducing the use of fossil fuels     and especially imported oil     reducing carbon emissions  and building a bridge from the use of corn ethanol to the use of cellulosic biomass ethanol   We jeopardize this potential and risk slowing down economic growth in rural America if Congress does not raise the RFS targets this year  I share your assessment that time is of the essence in moving a meaningful energy bill that includes a CAFE increase and an RFS upgrade through Congress to the President   s desk   And now that the Senate Republicans have united to block passage of the Farm Bill  we should not let a critical investment in our renewable energy future fall victim in the crossfire   I stand ready to do whatever I can to support you in this effort  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy
