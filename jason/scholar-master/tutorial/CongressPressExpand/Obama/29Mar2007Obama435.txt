   Senate Republicans Reject Emergency Funding for Wounded Soldiers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senate Republicans Reject Emergency Funding for Wounded Soldiers Thursday  March 29  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  DC     A proposal to improve medical treatment for wounded soldiers introduced by Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  was today rejected by Senate Republicans  following weeks of public outrage over the state of care for U S  servicemembers at military hospitals   The amendment  which would have provided  103 million in funding for additional caseworkers and mental health counselors  a women   s mental health treatment program  and a comprehensive mental health study of returning soldiers  was based on the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act the Senators introduced in February       Senate Republicans voted to continue the War in Iraq indefinitely  but they rejected essential funding to provide medical treatment for our brave soldiers who return home bearing the scars of war     said Senator Obama       The deplorable conditions at Walter Reed demonstrated that the state of care for our servicemembers is at a crisis level  and we must take action to ensure that we are prepared on the homefront to deal with the legacies of this war          How can we send men and women to war  but refuse to pay for proper care when they return injured     Senator McCaskill said      By killing this amendment  the Republicans are keeping our service members from receiving the care they deserve      Specifically  the Obama McCaskill amendment would have cut bureaucratic delays for service members by allocating funds to hire hundreds of new caseworkers at military hospitals around the country to make sure disability claims are processed in a timely fashion   It would have further eased the claims process by developing a secure system where service members can submit  track  and review paperwork via the Internet   Currently  service members wait an average of 209 days for their disability paperwork to be processed   The measure also addressed concerns about the mental health care for troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   The measure would have allowed the Department of Defense to hire additional mental health and crisis counselors at military hospitals around the country and established a women   s mental health treatment program  to help service members and their families cope with the stress of combat injuries   While the U S  waited 15 years to study psychological problems of the Vietnam veterans  the Obama McCaskill amendment would have directed the National Academy of Sciences to immediately examine the mental health and readjustment needs of those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   Obama vowed that his efforts to secure funding to improve services  reduce bureaucracy  and enhance treatment for servicemembers will continue      Our brave men and women in uniform didn   t hesitate when they were called to serve   We must not wait to improve care for our wounded warriors     said Obama
