Senator Barack Obama today made the following statement on the ambassadorial nominees before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   Earlier today  Senator Obama chaired the nominations hearing of  The Honorable Barbara McConnell Barrett to be Ambassador to the Republic of Finland The Honorable Yousif Boutrous Ghafari to be Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia Mr  Frank Urbancic  Jr  to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus Ms  Nancy E  McEldowney to be Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria Mr  Kurt D  Volker to be U S  Permanent Representative on the Council of NATO Prepared remarks provided below  Today  the Committee meets to consider the nomination of five important diplomatic positions   The President has nominated Barbara McConnell Barrett to be Ambassador to the Republic of Finland  Yousif Boutrous Ghafari to be Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia  Frank Urbancic  Jr  to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus  Nancy McEldowney to be Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria  and Kurt Volker to be the U S  Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization    I am very pleased to welcome each of our nominees today   Without exception  you bring an impressive range of talents and experience to your assignments    I look forward to discussing the challenges you are likely to encounter and how you intend to strengthen our nation and its allies in the course of your service  Your nominations come at a critical moment in the history of American diplomacy   The challenges we face are formidable  securing our country  revitalizing our alliances  bolstering young democracies  and confronting the common threats of the 21st century   terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease   Turning these challenges into opportunities will require renewed American leadership   It will also require ambassadors who exemplify the principles that make our nation great    Upon confirmation  each of you will work with countries that are close partners of the United States and share our common faith in the value of self determination  accountable governments  collective security  and human rights   Mr  Volker  if confirmed  will serve as the United States  permanent representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization   NATO is the most powerful and most successful military alliance in the history of the world   No organization has done more to promote peace and security in Europe  or to create the protective shield that has allowed the democracies of the North Atlantic to grow into a free and prosperous community    But  as we saw at last week s summit in Bucharest  NATO is not as strong  as capable  or as united as it should be   Afghanistan  NATO s first major mission beyond the borders of Europe  has been overlooked and undermanned by many members of the alliance  including the United States  Success in Afghanistan is critical to American national security  and to the security of the entire world   And a failure there would not only endanger our nation and global stability   it would cast serious doubt on the ability of NATO s military and political architecture to uphold our security in the 21st century    Some new troop commitments to Afghanistan were made in Bucharest  and that is good news   But neither the Administration nor our allies have yet done enough to muster the resources that would win the war there and prevent Afghanistan from reemerging as a safe haven for the Taliban and al Qaeda   The Bucharest summit also left out one of three candidates for membership  and failed to provide the young democracies of Georgia and Ukraine with membership action plans   Mr  Volker  you are a professional diplomat of the first order and I have confidence that you will represent the United States ably in Brussels   However  ensuring that NATO retains its rightful place as the cornerstone of the Euro Atlantic alliance will require that we do more to enlarge NATO to include worthy European democracies  and focus more resources on the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda   Doing so will require adroit diplomacy at NATO headquarters  but it will also mean making the case directly to the citizens of Europe that we must all increase our commitment to global security  We succeeded in coming together to confront the greatest challenges of the second half of the 20th century  We cannot succeed in confronting the challenges of the 21st unless we do so together   Mr  Urbancic  if confirmed you will be serving in Cyprus at a time of new optimism in the long struggle to bring an end to the estrangement of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities   After three decades  last Thursday s opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia was a tangible indication of good will on both sides of the island to forge a settlement between two peoples who share a common home  a common history  and a common destiny   I hope that the day of Cypriot reunification comes in the course of your ambassadorial service  and that you will do everything in your power to help the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community reach a just and lasting peace    Slovenia has been on the cutting edge of democratic change in Eastern Europe   Since its early success gaining membership in NATO and the European Union  it has been a model for progress in the Balkans   Despite its small size  Slovenia currently leads the nations of the European Union while it occupies the EU s presidency   Its citizens are helping to set the agenda for an entire continent   Slovenians are focusing Europe s attention on the unfinished business of bringing peace and prosperity to the Balkans   The people and government of Slovenia will need the help of the United States and other partners as they consolidate their democratic gains  and seek to extend those gains throughout the region  Mr  Ghafari  as an immigrant who has truly lived the American dream  you represent the strength found in our country s diversity   Similar strength should characterize life in the Balkans   in some parts of the region including Slovenia  it already does   I hope your story and your service will resonate with people throughout the former Yugoslavia  After a difficult transition from communism and setbacks in the 1990s  Bulgaria has made impressive economic strides in recent years   As a potential hub for oil and gas distribution  the country could play an important role in Europe s future energy security   However  Bulgaria continues to struggle with corruption and the corrosive influence of organized crime   Any failure to address these challenges could jeopardize the country s future cooperation with the European Union and  with it  much of the progress that has occurred in the recent past  Ms  McEldowney  you will need to work aggressively to assure that the democratic backsliding which has happened in some other parts of Eastern Europe does not occur in Bulgaria   The country s institutions and judicial system will need your support and assistance in order to help Bulgaria remain on course toward full Euro Atlantic integration   In recent years  the United States has dramatically reduced its financial assistance to Bulgaria  so you ll have to be creative   But your exemplary record as a member of the Foreign Service bodes well for your work on these critical tasks    Finally  Ms  Barrett  you have a different task  as you will represent America in a country that has travelled further down the path of democracy and prosperity   Finland is a world leader in technology and innovation  and even outranks the United States in some measures of development    But it still faces challenges in its relationship with Russia and its longstanding position outside of Euro Atlantic security institutions   At some point soon  Finland may move toward membership in NATO   Should the Finish people and government chose to pursue that objective  I hope you will be their biggest booster  All of you are coming before this Committee at a defining moment in America s story   Now is not a time for half hearted diplomacy   We need to raise the bar for our allies and that must begin with raising the bar for ourselves   Together with our partners in Europe  I am confident that we can make whole a world that is in need of repair    I look forward to a more detailed discussion of the challenges and opportunities that await you                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions
