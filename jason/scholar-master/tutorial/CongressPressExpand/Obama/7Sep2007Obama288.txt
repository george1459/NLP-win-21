to Make College More Affordable Friday  September  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5566 Obama efforts cut student loans  increase Pell Grants in Higher Ed Bill  WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  made the following statement on The College Cost Reduction and Access Act  which passed the Senate this morning  The bill included a provision to increase Pell Grants for eligible students by  500 next year  and to  5 400 by 2012  The bill also mandates that interest rates on subsidized student loans are cut in half over four years  Senator Obama sat on the Conference Committee that won these improvements in the bill  Below is a statement by Senator Obama   The first bill I introduced as a Senator was to make college more affordable for every American  and the bill we passed today is an important step toward achieving that goal     Senator Obama said      In a global economy where countries who out educate us will out compete us tomorrow  we must make a college education available and affordable for every American  and that means doing more to invest in programs that work and expanding them to more students   We must also end wasteful  high priced loans from private lenders and use the savings to help more students go to college   By investing in education we are restoring America s competitiveness in the world  and today is an important step forward  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on this issue    As a member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Obama also worked to secure an increase of  100 million in college aid for Illinois students in 2008 2009  and a projected  850 million over the next several years  This increased student aid is mostly in the form of Pell Grants  This is paid for not by increasing the deficit  but by reductions in government subsidies to banks and other lenders  This is similar to the provisions of the HOPE Act  the first bill Senator Obama introduced in the Senate in 2005  THE COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act Will Provide Over  20 Billion in New Student Aid and Benefits     The Largest Increase in Funding Since the GI Bill  According to a recent report on education statistics  twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 51 percent of the cost of tuition  fees  room and board at a public four year college  In the 2005 2006 school year  the maximum Pell Grant covered roughly a third of these costs  Democrats have worked to rectify this decline in the purchasing power of the Pell Grant  Under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act  the maximum Pell Grant will be increased by  500 next year to  4800 and to  5 400 by 2012   Analysis of Department

Interest Rate on Student Borrowers   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act reduces the interest rate on subsidized student loans  from 6 8 to 3 4 percent  making student loan repayment more manageable   HR 2669  2007  The Measure Protects Borrowers By Making Repayment Terms Manageable   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act places a cap on monthly student loan payments at 15 percent of discretionary income  so that graduates with significant loan debt can better manage their payments   HR 2669  2007   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act Provides Incentives for Students to Pursue Public Service Employment   The measure provides loan forgiveness if a student borrower spends at least ten years in a public service profession  including military service  In addition  the measure creates incentives for students to pursue careers as teachers by establishing TEACH grants  The grants would provide  4 000 per year for undergraduate students who commit to teaching in high need school districts   HR 2669  2007  A New Commitment to Students and Families  Report by the U S  Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor    Pensions  September 2007  The College Cost
