for Investigation of Long Term Care Thursday  March 29  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Requests GAO investigation following reports of a high number of rejected claims WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today wrote a letter to the head of the Government Accountability Office calling for an investigation into long term care following a report in the New York Times of a high number of claims being denied  and practices that make it    difficult     if not impossible     for policyholders to get paid      A copy of the letter is below  The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548 Dear Mr  Walker  A March 26  2007  article in the New York Times investigated the practices of several long term care insurers and reported a number of troubling findings about practices that    make it difficult     if not impossible     for policyholders to get paid      According to the article  nearly 1 in every 4 long term care claims in California was denied in 2005  Nearly 9 million long term care policies had been sold as of 2002  the most recent year for which data were available  with about 80 percent purchased through the individual market and the remaining 20 percent purchased through the group market   These products provide elderly Americans with coverage for care in their homes  assisted living facilities  and nursing homes   This range of services is critical for the health and financial well being of seniors  70 percent of whom will require long term care at some point in their lives  Long term care is a problem of national significance   As the baby boomers age  policymakers are struggling to design a long term care system that meets the needs of Americans with disabilities   While progress has been made  the long term care system is heavily biased towards institutional care  and the quality of care is often poor   Moreover  nursing home and home care are very expensive  and Medicare coverage for both is limited   As a result  catastrophic out of pocket expenses for nursing home and home care by American   s older people are routine  forcing many to rely on Medicaid to finance the care they need  The federal government has taken steps to promote the use of long term care insurance   The Long Term Care Partnership Program  a public private partnership between states and private insurance companies  is one such example   The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program  sponsored by the Office of Personnel Management for federal employees  is a second example   In addition  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has profoundly shaped the long term care market by establishing standards regarding the characteristics of policies whose premiums can count towards the tax deduction available for health care costs that exceed 7 5 percent of income  I have a number of serious concerns about the long term care insurance market and its ability to fulfill its promise to its policyholders   First  I am concerned about the possible arbitrary denial of insurance benefits to seniors at their time of need   Second  I am concerned that some insurers may be enticing individuals to buy policies by offering low premiums  and then sharply increasing premiums if lapse rates are not as high as assumed in the premium calculations   Third  a substantial percentage of policies do not offer inflation adjustments  resulting in a significant erosion of purchasing power in later years   Even worse  some companies offer    inflation coverage    which allows policyholders to purchase additional coverage at a later date  but at the price charged older purchasers   Premiums increase dramatically by age  and individuals who elect to buy coverage later may not realize that such coverage will be extremely expensive  which may be financially infeasible  Given the role of the federal government in long term care financing  I request that GAO investigate these allegations and the adequacy of state and federal regulation   Specifically  I request that GAO review the practices of these insurers in order to assess the following    Rate of denial of claims  and as feasible  the extent to which denials were justifiable  Types of policies purchased  including the percentage of policies that do adjust and do not adjust for inflation and those that allow for purchase of additional coverage at a later date   Estimated loss of purchasing power for those individuals that have policies without inflation adjustment provisions   Frequency and amount of premium increases in already purchased policies  average lapse rates of policyholders  and the correlation between premium increases and lapse rates    Extent to which long term care policies are marketed to individuals that would likely qualify for Medicaid or may not have substantial assets to protect  and   What  if any  additional federal regulation is needed  Thank you  Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator
