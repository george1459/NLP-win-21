   Senators Urge GAO to Study the Military s Mental Health Care   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Urge GAO to Study the Military s Mental Health Care Thursday  April 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  Boxer  Bond  Akaka  Harkin  Lieberman  Murray  McCaskill  Sanders ask for review in light of troubling reports  WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Tom Harkin  D IA   Joe Lieberman  I CT   Patty Murray  D WA   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Bernie Sanders  I VT  today sent a letter to the General Accounting Office  GAO  requesting a review of the Department of Defense   s treatment of service related mental health conditions affecting troops that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   The letter comes in the wake of reports of poor treatment and conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Centers  where many patients and family members described not receiving adequate mental health care  and more recent reports that suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has not effectively screened and diagnosed mental health conditions   Senators Boxer  Bond  and Obama had previously asked that the Department of Defense to examine command practices and culture related to mental health care with no response   As the DOD drags its feet  the senators have requested the GAO to investigate agency practices related to mental health screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members    Recent reports suggest that the Department of Defense is ill equipped to effectively screen and diagnose the increasing number of service members who are suffering from mental health conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder     said Senator Obama      I m especially troubled by reports of some DOD commanders downplaying the serious mental health conditions confronting service members returning home from Iraq  and then redeploying those troops without proper treatment    It s time for a full accounting of how many of our troops are affected by post traumatic stress disorder  other service connected mental health conditions  and traumatic brain injuries  and for an evaluation of our readiness to help the generation of soldiers returning home from war rebuild their lives    Senator Boxer said   Two years ago  military doctors informed me that soldiers with serious mental health problems were being denied care and redeployed to Iraq   Sadly  even after we passed legislation and the Defense Department issued new mental health guidelines  they are not being followed   It is time for the GAO to investigate allegations of mistreatment and improper discharges   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans        Combat stress and its impact on our soldiers and their families is a serious problem that continues to grow   Reports that our military is unprepared or unwilling to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome or other mental health problems are unacceptable   Being unprepared for these problems is no excuse for inaction  It is our duty to take care of the brave men and women who have answered the call to duty   said Senator Kit Bond       I am deeply concerned about the consequences of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan on the mental health of those who serve     said Senator Akaka      PTSD and other mental health problems  the often invisible wounds of war  can be terribly debilitating   As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Veterans    Affairs Committee  I am working to ensure that our wounded warriors receive a timely diagnosis of mental health problems and prompt and effective response   This effort must begin while servicemembers are still on active duty and there have been far too many reports that this is not happening   The results of this requested GAO review will be of great importance as we seek to ensure that DOD and VA meet the needs of our newest war veterans          With news that our soldiers will be serving longer tours of duty with shorter periods of rest at home  there is no better time to ensure the men and women who serve our country are getting the mental health services they need     said Senator Harkin     We must do away with the stigma associated with mental illness and remove any obstacles to treatment          We have a moral obligation to care for our wounded troops and ensure they receive the best care     said Senator Lieberman      Post traumatic stress disorder is afflicting many of our service members and it is imperative that we accurately and efficiently diagnose and treat it  The stakes are high for those that are sacrificing their lives for our country and we must work together to correct any deficiencies that we find in our military   s mental health system       We can t afford to wait until a year after our service members have returned home to discover the affects of the unseen wounds of this war   said Senator Murray   PTSD is taking a horrible toll on our service members and their families and we must be sure today that they are being properly screened  tracked  and treated  We can no longer be unprepared for this mounting problem        Our men and women returning from war should receive mental health care equal to the physical medical care they are given  and anything less is unacceptable     Senator McCaskill said      It took this country 15 years after Vietnam to look at the mental health needs of veterans   We can   t do that to another generation of soldiers          The men and women who put their lives on the line for this country deserve the best care we can provide     Senator Bernie Sanders said      What has been revealed about Defense Department health care is a disgrace that needs to be addressed   We need to find out whether there is a concerted effort by the Defense Department to shortchange our soldiers and veterans who are in need of mental health care and other benefits they have earned      The text of the letter is below  The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General   Government Accountability Office  GAO    441 G Street  NW  Room 7125   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Walker    We are writing to request that the General Accounting Office  GAO  undertake a review of Department of Defense  DOD  screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members who may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and other mental health conditions related to their service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Several of us previously wrote the DOD requesting an examination of command practices and reports of biases and misdiagnoses in the treatment of mental health related injuries such as PTSD and other deployment related health problems  including Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   but have not yet received a response    The stigmas associated with PTSD and other mental health needs are no less potent within the military than in the civilian world   Indeed  reports from soldiers suffering from PTSD suggest that the stigma is worse  with some military commanders appearing to minimize the significance of PTSD and other mental health needs  or suggesting that a service member is malingering to avoid redeployment   There are allegations of commanders at Fort Carson  Colorado denying soldiers access to mental health care and instead ordering them redeployed for additional tours in Iraq   We have also heard of cases in which service members with PTSD are diagnosed as having    personality disorders    that the Army considers    pre existing     thus depriving otherwise eligible combat veterans of disability benefits and much needed mental healthcare  Because the stakes for our service members    and their health are so high  we must move quickly to investigate and correct any deficiencies   We have come to learn about a number of upsetting allegations at Fort Carson   Therefore  for the purposes of an expedited review  we request to be briefed initially by GAO on these immediate cases   We ask that you subsequently focus your inquiry not only on Fort Carson but on system wide mental health deficiencies within the DOD   With the significant burdens already being placed on our service members and their families with multiple extended deployments  we must ensure that they are not further burdened with any humiliation  stigmatization or other minimization of genuine mental health needs  Our service members are risking their lives for our nation   s security  it is our moral obligation to care for them  We therefore ask the GAO to assess    Known cases of improper discharges or misdiagnoses and patterns of systematic stigmatization employed by military commanders regarding the mental health needs of service members throughout the chain of command at Fort Carson and across DOD departments   The growing number of discharges for personality disorders  and whether or not such discharges are being improperly used when service members should in fact be given a mental health diagnosis that DOD does not consider preexisting   The overall number of misdiagnosed cases of PTSD  other mental health conditions  and TBIs  at Fort Carson and force wide    DOD progress in implementing previous mandates to develop force wide criteria and procedures for screening  diagnosing and referring mental health cases for follow up treatment   The efficacy of the DOD   s current mental health safety net and treatment capabilities  for example  what current mechanisms are available to service members in the event of misdiagnosis    The steps and resources required to implement one on one  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members    The number of service members  men and women  reporting mental health concerns related to sexual assault during deployment  and whether current DOD personnel training and diagnostic guidance is sufficiently responsive to the needs of both men and women    We seek to ensure that the DOD has the resources necessary to diagnose and treat service connected injuries that impact the mental health of U S  service personnel  It is vital that the U S  military ensures it is treating the mental health needs of our forces with the same priority and resource investments it is devoting to physical injuries   If you would like to discuss this request  please contact  redacted   Thank you for your assistance in this matter
