   Bipartisan Proposal to Require Federal Contractors to Pay Taxes Passes Senate   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Bipartisan Proposal to Require Federal Contractors to Pay Taxes Passes Senate Friday  July 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Obama   Kendra Barkoff  Casey   or Max Gleischman  Durbin    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Bob Casey  D PA   Tom Coburn  R OK  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today lauded the Senate   s passage of their amendment to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Appropriations bill that would withhold federal homeland security contracts from companies and grantees that have not paid their federal taxes   According to studies by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   thousands of federal agency contractors owe billions of dollars in unpaid taxes   This amendment will withhold large DHS contracts from businesses and organizations that failed to file tax returns and were delinquent on payroll taxes for a significant period of time       Our government should not reward companies that fail to pay their taxes with federal contracts     said Senator Obama      Working Americans don   t get a free pass if they are unable to pay their taxes when they are due  and corporations shouldn   t either   This amendment will ensure that corporations that receive taxpayer funding play by the rules  and it will increase transparency and accountability over how our money is spent        The fact that these contractors continue to receive millions of dollars in federal contracts despite having unpaid tax bills is unacceptable     said Senator Casey      If you don   t pay taxes  you can   t get a taxpayer funded contract   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for recognizing the importance of holding these contractors accountable so that we can reduce the abuse of the tax system      The notion that we should reward companies who fail to pay taxes is hugely misguided   Senator Durbin said   Billions in unpaid taxes from thousands of federal contractors  and the inability for agencies to take action is unacceptable and we need to put a stop to it      This proposal is the kind of common sense oversight we need to see more of in Congress   In the real world  no company would survive if it didn   t pay its bills   Yet  the government routinely rewards companies that break the law and fail to meet basic performance standards   This solution will help fix one part of that problem   I   m proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of aisle in defense of common sense  transparency and openness     Dr  Coburn said  Representative Brad Ellsworth  D IN  originally introduced the Federal Contractor Accountability Act  H R  1986  in the House of Representatives in April   In numerous studies  the GAO found that thousands of General Services Administration  GSA  contractors maintained tax debts totaling over  3 billion   Many of these businesses failed to forward payroll taxes withheld from their employees and other taxes to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS    Failure to submit payroll taxes is a felony under the law   Moreover  some companies even redirected payroll taxes for personal gain   These companies were contractors for the Department of Homeland Security amongst other agencies  Neither federal law nor GSA policies require federal agencies  like the DHS  to consider tax debts in making contracting decisions   In fact  current law prohibits the disclosure of taxpayer data  which means there is no mechanism for contracting officers to access the IRS   s tax data when conducting their review of prospective contractors   While the government requires agencies to consider various criteria  including financial resources  business ethics  and integrity  tax debt is not considered in the determination   Without a systematic review process  the federal government ultimately continues to award lucrative contracts to companies with significant tax debt   This amendment will withhold federal contracts and grants over  5 million from tax delinquent businesses and organizations
