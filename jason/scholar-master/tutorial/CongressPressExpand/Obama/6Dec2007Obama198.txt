   Obama and Harkin Praise Compromise Energy Bill as Critical to Future of the Domestic Biofuels Industry and the Rural Economy   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama and Harkin Praise Compromise Energy Bill as Critical to Future of the Domestic Biofuels Industry and the Rural Economy Thursday  December  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                     CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Kate Cyrul  HARKIN   Bill incorporates Obama Harkin proposals on RFS  Carbon Fuels Standard   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  praised the agreement on energy legislation reached by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as an important step toward diversifying the country   s energy supply and strengthening the economy of rural America   The legislation includes an immediate expansion of the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  to 36 billion gallons by 2022 and lays important groundwork for the future adoption of a national low carbon fuels standard  proposals that Obama and Harkin had jointly proposed previously as a means of reducing the country   s dependence on fossil fuels  combating climate change and promoting economic growth in rural communities    In October  in the face of a precipitous decline in the price of ethanol which threatens the viability of community sized ethanol plants and discourages private sector investment in cellulosic biomass ethanol technologies  Obama and Harkin introduced a bill that would boost the price of ethanol by requiring the use of more renewable fuels in the nation   s gasoline pool  Today   s high gas prices coupled with low ethanol prices are a clear indication that an increased RFS is needed   The updated RFS passed the Senate earlier this year in comprehensive energy legislation but is currently languishing due to controversy about other elements of that energy bill        If we   re going to get serious about investing in our energy future we must give our family farmers and local ethanol producers a fair shot at success     Senator Obama said      They have grown the ethanol industry from the ground up  and are demonstrating the potential of innovative technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and moderate gas prices  But I continue to hear from farmers and the managers of community ethanol facilities about how this drop in the price of ethanol is not only threatening their livelihood but also the future of the biofuels industry  including the transition from corn ethanol to cellulosic biomass ethanol   The compromise bill announced by Sen  Reid and Speaker Pelosi today will prevent Big Oil from continuing to depress the ethanol market and help assure this promise is fulfilled          The potential for America to supply a great deal of our energy from domestic sources is enormous  but it is past time for government to provide a signal to producers  marketers and consumers of renewable fuels that we are serious about renewables as a long term and significant segment of our transportation fuel supply     said Harkin      Securing a new renewable fuels standard will ensure the continued viability and expansion of locally owned ethanol and biodiesel plants while providing a necessary incentive for investments in emerging  next generation biofuels production       Obama and Harkin also commended Reid and Pelosi for recognizing that U S  energy policy cannot ignore the effect of climate change and establishing of 20  50 and 60 percent carbon reduction targets for biofuels over the next 15 years    In May  Obama and Harkin introduced legislation establishing a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard which established similar goals       I am delighted to see this important legislation moving forward and I commend Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi     said Harkin       Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi deserve great credit for their vision in crafting this energy bill     Obama added       I share their view that it is time to lead the country toward a low carbon future  and I appreciate their acknowledgment that American agriculture has a prominent role to play in this effort                                    Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
