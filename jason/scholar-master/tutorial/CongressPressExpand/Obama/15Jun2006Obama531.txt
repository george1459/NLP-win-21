   Remarks by Senator Barack Obama on the Paris Hilton Tax Break   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Remarks by Senator Barack Obama on the Paris Hilton Tax Break Wednesday  June  7  2006  As prepared for delivery First of all  let s call this trillion dollar giveaway what it is   the Paris Hilton Tax Break   It s about giving billions of dollars to billionaire heirs and heiresses at a time when American taxpayers just can t afford it     The Republicans have brought out the Paris Hilton Tax Break in June because they re eager to make it an election issue in November     And I think that s fine   In fact  I m eager for the American people to choose   Because if people want their government to spend one trillion dollars   an amount more than double what we ve spent on Iraq  Afghanistan  and the War on Terror combined   on tax breaks for multimillionaires and multibillionaires  than the Republican Party is your party     If the American people want to borrow billions more from the Chinese  spend billions more in taxes to pay the interest on our debt  and watch billions cut from health care and education and Gulf Coast Reconstruction  then the Paris Hilton Tax Break is your tax break     This isn t about saving small businesses and family farms   We can reform the estate tax to protect these Americans   We can set it at a level where no small business or family farm is ever affected   and we can do it in a way that doesn t cost us a trillion dollars   In fact  we ve offered to reform the estate tax in this way time and time again     But over and over  our offer has been refused  which can only mean that the party in power is really interested in giving this money to the wealthiest of the wealthy    And so I would ask the American people one question   At a time like this   a time where America finds itself deeply in debt  struggling to pay for a war in Iraq  a war in Afghanistan  security for our homeland  armor for our troops  health care for our workers  and education for our children   at a time of all this need  can you imagine opening Forbes magazine  looking at their list of the 400 wealthiest Americans  and realizing that our government gave the people on that list over half a trillion dollars worth of tax breaks     I know I can t imagine that   And I would bet that most Americans can t imagine that either   So if the Republicans want to bring up their Paris Hilton Tax Break to use it as an election issue later  I say go for it   Because I can think of no better statement about where and how we differ in priorities than that
