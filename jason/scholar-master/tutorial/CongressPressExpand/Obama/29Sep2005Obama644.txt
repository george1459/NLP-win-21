Passage is First Step to Ensuring Financial Accountability   WASHINGTON   Legislation introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  designed to ensure financial integrity in the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort passed the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs today by unanimous voice vote  Unanimous committee passage is a crucial first step in ensuring that the Oversight of Vital Emergency Recovery Spending Enhancement and Enforcement Act  OVERSEE  becomes law    Recently  Congress approved  62 billion for Gulf Coast relief and rebuilding efforts   most of which will go directly to FEMA   said Obama   This is twelve times the amount of money FEMA was given last year   more than it has ever been trusted to spend before  If FEMA s track record during the rescue effort and in years before is any indication of how they will perform during the rebuilding that lies ahead  this should concern every taxpayer and every citizen interested in helping the millions of Americans who have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina     Previous rebuilding efforts involving FEMA and other government agencies have a history of fraud  corruption  and waste when there is no oversight or accountability in how the funds are spent  Following Hurricane Frances in 2004  FEMA awarded  30 million and approved more than 12 000 claims for residents of Miami Dade County  The storm  however  made landfall 100 miles north and Miami Dade never even saw hurricane force winds    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    As we look towards the massive Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts ahead  we must demand accountability over how the billions of dollars we ve given to FEMA are spent   said Obama   The CFO will also specifically look at whether federal funds are going to people most in need  whether federal funds are going to companies that hire local workers  and the extent to which the federal government is using no bid and  cost plus  contracts  As you ll recall  these contracts are what caused the whole contracting mess in Iraq     Even if the levees hadn t burst and New Orleans didn t flood  Hurricane Katrina would still be the largest natural disaster this country has ever faced  and the rebuilding effort will be certainly be the largest and costliest of its kind  This entrusts FEMA with a massive amount of responsibility  and so it s only right that we protect both taxpayers and citizens on the Gulf Coast with strict accountability and oversight about how the money is being spent and whether it s being most efficiently directed to helping people rebuild their lives  I believe the bill s unanimous passage by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs shows our commitment to financial accountability in these rebuilding efforts  and is an important first step in creating a CFO who will help ensure our tax dollars aren t wasted    SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina  Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse  The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President  The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers
