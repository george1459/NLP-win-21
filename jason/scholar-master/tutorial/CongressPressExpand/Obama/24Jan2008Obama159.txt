   Obama Joins Kennedy  Lewis to Introduce Civil Rights Act of 2008 Thursday  January 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                            CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  DC   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congressman John Lewis  along with more than a dozen Senate colleagues  introduced the Civil Rights Act of 2008  which will strengthen accountability when civil rights and workers  rights are violated   Recent court decisions have weakened America s civil rights laws in ways that Congress never intended   This legislation will ensure accountability for violations of our civil rights and fair labor laws and give individuals the right to challenge practices that have unjustified discriminatory effect based on race  color  national origin  disability  age or gender  It also gives students the same protection from harassment in school that workers have on the job  and holds employers fully accountable for age discrimination and discrimination against our men and women in the armed services   The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is co sponsored by Senators Leahy  Dodd  Lautenberg  Bingaman  Kerry  Harkin  Mikulski  Akaka  Boxer  Feingold  Murray  Durbin  Schumer  Cantwell  Clinton  Obama  Menendez  Cardin  and Brown   Senator Kennedy said   Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America   Prejudice  discrimination  and outright bigotry continue to limit the lives of large numbers of our people  and even some courts have rolled back core protections for civil rights and workers  rights  The Civil Rights Act of 2008 will restore the bedrock principle that individuals may challenge all forms of discrimination in public services and will strengthen existing civil rights protections   Our civil rights and fair labor laws must have effective remedies that ensure accountability for discrimination  or America will never be America    The struggle for civil rights in this country   said Rep  John Lewis   has been a long hard road  littered with the broken bodies of countless men and women who gave all they had for the cause of social justice    They were sharecroppers  sanitation workers  teachers  students  ministers  priests  housewives  and activists   They were ordinary people with extraordinary vision who joined together and tore down the walls of legalized segregation and racial discrimination in this country   Only a few decades later  we cannot allow recent court decisions to turn back the clock and open the door to contemporary abuses   That is why Sen  Kennedy and I have worked so hard to meet every judicial step backward with a legislative step forward   We want to be able to say that on our watch  we did all we could as members of Congress to ensure the protection of civil rights in this country and hold discriminatory employers and individuals accountable   With the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 2008  we hope the 110th Congress will hold the same legacy  as a legislative body that continued the march toward a democracy in this country that ensures liberty and justice for all    I have been a long time supporter of efforts to rid the workplace of unlawful discrimination  and I believe the Civil Rights Act of 2008 is critical to achieving that important goal   said Leahy    This bill ensures that protections against workplace bias and discrimination  which conservative courts have attempted to roll back  are fully protected and restored   It is particularly important that  on the week that our nation observes and honors the legacy of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   Congress has introduced this bill   We must remain vigilant in ensuring our precious civil rights  which generations of Americans fought and bled to protect  remain available for our children and our grandchildren   I will continue to fight to end all workplace discrimination  including discrimination based on sexual orientation    The best way to honor the memory of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  is to continue his work to ensure that America lives up to its promise of treating all citizens equally   said Dodd    The fight for civil rights will not be won or lost in a single battle  but instead is an ongoing struggle taking place in our workplaces  schools  and communities across the nation   I am honored to join Senator Kennedy and my colleagues in the Senate and Congressman John Lewis in the House of Representatives in introducing a bill that will give Americans the tools and support they need to defend themselves and others when their civil rights have been violated    We need to put teeth back in our civil rights laws   Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said    This bill would reaffirm the basic American value that everyone  regardless of race  gender or age  should have the same opportunities to succeed    This legislation is an important step in restoring the ability of Americans to protect their civil rights in courts   U S  Senator Jeff Bingaman said     I am proud to stand with Senator Kennedy and our colleagues to stop the assault on civil rights in our country   said Sen  Kerry   Too many brave Americans marched  fought  and faced down snarling dogs and fire hoses in the struggle for civil rights to have decades of progress erased by a few misguided decisions made by conservative judges   Our country is great because we believe in Jefferson s promise of God given inalienable rights for every citizen  and because we know it takes a government committed to protecting them to make the promise of civil rights real for the American people    Over 40 years ago Congress made it clear that discrimination is unacceptable in this country   said Harkin   In recent years however the Supreme Court has eroded these important laws and our action today is a first step towards restoring crucial civil rights protections in order to stamp out bigotry and injustice    The Supreme Court s decision in Alexander v  Sandoval sent a dangerous message about equity in this country   I am proud to team up with my colleagues to right this wrong   said Senator Mikulski   We need to reexamine what this country must still do to make sure that all Americans are protected from discriminatory acts   This bill ensures that those who have received injustice in the workplace have their fair day in court    There is no better way of honoring the civil rights movement than by working to address the erosion of protections we see today   said Senator Murray  Chair of the HELP Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee   This bill restores many of our most basic civil rights by confronting threats on the job and in our schools  We cannot continue to allow students to be harassed  employment laws to be marginalized  and discrimination to go unpunished  I am proud to support Senator Kennedy and Rep  Lewis in this effort   Senator Schumer said   For too long  the Supreme Court s cramped interpretations of civil rights statutes have closed the doors of the federal courts to people with claims of discrimination  This important legislation will right the wrong of those decisions  and restore Congress s original intent to protect all citizens by holding accountable those that violate our cherished civil rights    In recent years  we have seen courts erode key civil rights protections in our workplaces  our schools and our communities   said Senator Clinton    This important bill will reverse a number of these troubling decisions  and restore the promise of our nation s civil rights laws for millions of Americans    Too many hardworking Americans continue to face discrimination and unfair employment practices  and we must do everything we can to guarantee that all Americans receive fair and equal treatment under the law   said Senator Obama    Civil rights have to be at the forefront of our national dialogue  and we must ensure that those who suffer discrimination  whether by the federal government or private employers  can protect themselves legally   The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is an important step in our continuing battle against age discrimination  religious discrimination  the misuse of federal funds  and upholding workers  rights   I commend Chairman Kennedy for his leadership on this bill   and for his lifelong leadership on these issues   and urge my colleagues to quickly pass this legislation    Just because the calendar says 2008 doesn t mean that the need to fight for civil rights in our country is over   said Sen  Menendez   This week  we all reflected on the legacy of Dr  Martin Luther King  and this legislation helps carry on that legacy  Federal tax dollars should never be used to discriminate against or disadvantage our citizens  It is our responsibility to sustain our commitment to civil rights  and with this legislation  we can restore some of the major civil rights principles that have been diluted  I applaud Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on civil rights    Discrimination for any reason has no place in America  The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is essential to restoring the balance to our system that provides equal opportunity for every American   said Senator Cardin   There has been a growing disregard of the original intent of Congress by many conservative judges in the area of civil rights law  For many  this has eroded their chance at achieving the American Dream  I believe Congress must act to reverse this troubling trend    This legislation bolsters the rights of Americans by ensuring there are consequences when an individual s civil rights are breached   Brown said   It is a bill that honors our constitution  and I am proud to support it                                   Pursuant to  policy
