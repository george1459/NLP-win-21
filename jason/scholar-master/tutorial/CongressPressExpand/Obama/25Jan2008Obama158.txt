   Obama Joins Boxer  Senators to Introduce Bill to Reverse EPA Global Warming Waiver Decision   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Boxer  Senators to Introduce Bill to Reverse EPA Global Warming Waiver Decision Friday  January 25  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT Peter Rafle  Boxer EPW   Kate Gilman  Boxer EPW   or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Washington  DC   U S  Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  introduced legislation today that would direct the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to grant California a waiver under the Clean Air Act to cut global warming pollution from motor vehicles      Cosponsors of the bill include Senators Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  ID  CT   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Benjamin Cardin  D MD   Bernie Sanders  I VT   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Patrick Leahy  D VT   Christopher Dodd  D CT   John Kerry  D MA   Barbara A  Mikulski  D MD   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Susan Collins  R ME   Bill Nelson  D FL   Barack Obama  D  IL   and Roberts Menendez  D NJ   Senator Boxer said   Administrator Johnson s decision to deny the waiver was not supported by the facts  by the law  by the science  or by precedent   I will use every available tool to ensure that California and the nation are able to reduce the pollution that causes global warming   One of those tools is legislation that essentially overturns Mr  Johnson s actions   Senator Obama said   Effectively tackling global warming demands bold and innovative solutions  and given the failure of this Administration to act  California should be allowed to pioneer   I commend Chairman Boxer for her leadership on this bill and on working to eliminate the damaging consequences of climate change around the world   Senator Feinstein said   It s become clear that Administrator Johnson s denial of California s waiver was based on politics  not science  Even the EPA s own experts have said that there was a compelling need for action   So  today  Senator Boxer and I have introduced legislation to take this decision out of the hands of the EPA   and allow California to move ahead with curbing tailpipe emissions   Bottom line  I m committed to protecting California s landmark global warming efforts   and will do everything in my power to ensure that this Administration doesn t stand in the way   Senator Lieberman said   The vision and leadership of California  Connecticut  and the other states that have moved to curb global warming pollution from cars should be rewarded by the grant of authority to implement the states  programs   In the wake of the Bush administration s failure to follow federal law and deliver the needed authority  we in Congress must step in with legislation that gives the states the go ahead to fight climate change   Senator Clinton said   It is outrageous that the Bush Administration chose to block the efforts of New York  California and many other states that want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles  Chairman Boxer s continued oversight on this issue is critically important  and I am proud to join with her in introducing legislation to overturn EPA s wrongheaded decision and allow states to move forward on global warming   Senator Lautenberg said   It s bad enough the Bush Administration has been sitting on its hands and done virtually nothing to fight global warming  but now it s trying to block states from taking strong action on their own   Our legislation would work to overturn this misguided decision and allow states like New Jersey and California to continue their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and combat global warming    Senator Cardin said   The EPA has clearly chosen to ignore the issue of global warming   It s time that States are allowed to take meaningful action to protect the health of their citizens by reducing greenhouse gas emissions    Senator Sanders told the EPA administrator   If you can t do the right thing  at least get out of the way of California  Vermont and other states   If we do not move aggressively  this planet is in danger   Senator Whitehouse said   Allowing Rhode Island and all these states to set tough vehicle emissions standards is one of the strongest and most common sense steps we can take to begin to tackle the enormous challenge of global warming   But once again  this administration has put blind ideology before science  once again  this administration has let politics govern policy  and once again  this administration has taken an action that will directly undermine our efforts to protect our environment and safeguard public health   I applaud Chairman Boxer s commitment to addressing this issue and am proud to cosponsor this important bill   Senator Kennedy said   It s extremely unfortunate that the Administration has stood in the way of states  efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles   I commend Senator Boxer for her leadership in filing this bill  which is so vital to states like Massachusetts and California which are ready to do the things necessary to curb global warming in spite of the obstacles EPA has set   Senator Leahy said   The Bush Administration has been AWOL or worse on air quality issues  and now they even want to undermine states like California and Vermont that are trying to pick up the slack   They won t lead and they won t follow  so the Boxer bill would force them at least to get out of the way and stop obstructing states like ours that are trying to lead on clean air policy   Senator Dodd said   The EPA s decision in December to deny the request by California  Connecticut  and 15 other states for the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles was a politically motivated roadblock erected to stop responsible solutions to the growing problem of global warming   Indeed  evidence suggests that EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson ignored the advice of his own climate experts  who recommended that this request be approved  This bill restores those efforts to address one of the most pressing issues of our day   I thank Senator Boxer for her leadership on this issue and am committed to seeing this important piece of legislation passed   Senator Kerry said   If the Bush Administration refuses to combat climate change  they at least need to get out of the way when the states do   California needs this waiver  and deserves a lot of credit for meeting an environmental challenge with the reform it demands   Senator Mikulski said   The world is facing a climate crisis and we must act now   Maryland and a number of other states have already joined California in setting a higher bar to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles than the federal government has   The country is looking to us for leadership   As we continue to assist our manufacturing industries in making this transition  we need to set the standard so states can do the right thing   Senator Snowe said   I am deeply disappointed that the Administration failed to follow the statute outlined in the Clean Air Act that allows California to adopt distinct environmental laws  This is a setback for Maine and as well as our national environmental stewardship   Although I am confident that the court system will ultimately overturn this decision  I am troubled that this Administration has unnecessarily delayed enactment of a strong curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions  This legislation will allow the states to move forward with enacting strong reductions in green house gas emissions filling the void of federal action   Senator Collins said   Climate change is one of the most daunting challenges we face and we must develop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions    If states  like my home state of Maine  establish reasonable standards to help address this serious problem  the federal government should not stand in the way   Senator Nelson said   The failure of the Bush administration to allow states to clean up auto emissions means that Congress is going to have to step in and pass this legislation    Sen  Menendez said   Our planet is in peril and this administration simply refuses to let anyone do very much about it  Under this administration  the EPA is acting like the  Environmental Pollution Agency   Since they won t act  states that want to undertake serious efforts to clean our air should not have their hands tied  New Jersey is one of those states and I will stand up for our right to help save our planet  I applaud Chairwoman Boxer for her leadership on this issue   The bill introduced today directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to grant California s request for the waiver  which will allow California to implement its greenhouse gas emissions standards for motor vehicles   The waiver will also permit other states to adopt California s emissions standards    Fourteen other states have adopted California s standards  or are in the process of adopting them   Another four are moving toward adopting the California standards   All together  those 19 states represent more than 152 000 000 Americans   a majority of the U S  population                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic
