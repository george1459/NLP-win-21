   Obama Works to Expand Use of Biofuels Nationwide   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Works to Expand Use of Biofuels Nationwide Monday  March 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Contact  Ben LaBolt  Urges Underwriters Laboratories to certify  blender pumps  to make E85 fuels more accessible to motorists across the country  WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Barack Obama was today joined by Senators Durbin  D IL   Harkin  D IA   Lugar  R IN   Bayh  D IN   Nelson  D NE   Grassley  R IA   Klobuchar  D MN   Thune  R SD   Feingold  D WI   McCaskill  D MO   Voinovich  R OH   Brown  D OH   and Brownback  R KS  in urging Underwriters Laboratories  UL   the world s leading product safety testing organization  to complete its certification process for the multi product fuel dispensers that allow service stations to sell higher ethanol blends up to E85    an 85  ethanol 15  traditional gasoline blend   Several years ago  UL approved the use of multi product fuel dispenser components only to rescind that certification on October 5  2006  announcing it would reconsider whether to certify the dispensers even though there were no documented problems       American manufacturers are doing their part to lead the United States toward energy independence by increasing the use of biofuels  but some roadblocks remain     said U S  Senator Barack Obama      While the biofuels industry will soon produce enough ethanol to make higher fuel blends widely available to consumers  and automakers have steadily increased the production of Flexible Fuel Vehicles  just over 1 000 retailers across the nation carry E85 pumps    UL certification will remove one of the last remaining roadblocks to the widespread installation of dual fuel pumps that give motorists the choice between renewable fuels and traditional gasoline      Approximately 1 100 service stations are equipped to dispense E85 in the U S  today   Congress has enacted a federal income tax credit to offset the cost for service stations of installing of E85 fueling systems  and many states have lowered excise tax rates and provided other incentives to advance E85   But UL s decision to rescind its previously issued E85 certifications and uncertainty as to when its current certification review will be completed has caused some fire marshals  code administrators  and other officials cross the nation to block the installation of new E85 fueling systems   In their letter to Keith Williams  President and CEO of Underwriters Laboratory  the senators wrote     We appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol  but we are extremely disappointed that this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals      Given UL s admission that there has never been an E85 fueling system failure  a report of such failure  or even evidence of corrosion in E85 fueling systems  the decision to rescind the prior approvals while you carry out new testing is troubling     We believe it is in the national interest for UL to either re issue the prior certifications that were available to E85 dispensing equipment or document why it believes these pumps are unsafe  establish a firm timetable to complete its updated testing and analysis  and issue a revised draft protocol to industry as soon as practicable      Sen  Obama has noted that that Brazil is a prime example of a nation that has successfully expanded its infrastructure for distributing higher ethanol blends  from E30 to E85  in special pumps that allow motorists to select what blend of biofuels they want  depending upon cost and availability   Nearly all automobiles manufactured in Brazil today are FFV s  or Flexible Fuel Vehicles  which means they are designed to run efficiently on any blend of ethanol or gasoline    Twenty years from now our nation s transportation fuels sector will be powered primarily by domestically produced biofuels  if we have the vision and the will to make that happen   Obama said    Just as we sent a man to the moon  we can harness our technological skills and entrepreneurial spirit to end our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil   In doing so  we will not only protect our national security  we will also protect our public health  create quality jobs for the next generations  and keep billions of dollars here at home  rather than sending them to nations that want to do us harm    In his State of the Union Address last January  President Bush identified the use of higher ethanol blends  including E85  as one of the nation   s leading alternatives to hydrocarbon based transportation fuels and proposed requiring 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels be used in U S  fuels by 2017   This critical goal cannot be met without making these fuels more readily available to motorists  and  as a practical matter  that access is dependent upon UL certification of E85 dispensing equipment   A copy of the letter to Keith Williams  President and CEO of Underwriters Laboratory is embedded below  Mr  Keith Williams  President and CEO  Underwriters Laboratory  333 Pfingsten Road  Northbrook  Illinois 60062 2096 Dear Mr  Williams  We are writing in regard to the recent decision by Underwriter Laboratories  UL  to rescind its previously issued certifications for components of E85 refueling systems  and the new efforts by UL to establish E85 component and fuel dispenser testing protocols   UL initiated a review of the safety of multi product fuel dispenser components and approved their use several years ago   On October 5  2006  UL rescinded the certification for these components and announced that it would embark on an extended recertification procedure for the dispensers themselves   We understand that re evaluation of material testing protocol is not uncommon and indeed should occur in the normal course of time  and we appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol   We are concerned  however  why this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals     especially when UL has acknowledged no documented reports of corrosion for UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  no field incidents related to UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  and no reported safety issues associated with Listed or Recognized components used with E85 Moreover  the actions taken by UL have not provided equipment manufacturers  ethanol producers  and the motoring public with adequate certainty and clarity as to the timetable for completion of the process   We know and agree that any device that displays the UL imprimatur must have its characteristics fully reviewed and tested according to key standards and procedures   We request your assurances that both timetable and testing are not mutually exclusive goals   Congress has taken significant steps to transition to alternative fuels such as E 85   setting mandatory targets for increased ethanol use  enacting a federal income tax credit to offset the cost of installation of E85 fueling systems  and funding efforts to expand E 85 refueling infrastructure nationwide  of which now there are more than 1 100 pumps   UL is essential to these transition efforts     UL has tested products for public safety for more than a century and has earned its well deserved reputation as an unbiased gatekeeper for the introduction of American innovation in the marketplace
