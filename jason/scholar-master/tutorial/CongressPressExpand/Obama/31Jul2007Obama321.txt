   Investigation of FEMA Toxic Trailers Included in Homeland Security Bill   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Investigation of FEMA Toxic Trailers Included in Homeland Security Bill Friday  July 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   Ben LaBolt  Obama   Michael Teague  Pryor   Stephanie Allen  Landrieu   Vince Morris  Kerry   or Julianne Fisher  Johnson   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators McCaskill  D MO   Obama  D IL   Pryor  D AK   Landrieu  D LA   Lieberman  D CT   Kerry  D MA   and Johnson  D SD  yesterday secured Senate passage of a measure in the 2008 Homeland Security spending bill that would require comprehensive testing of Hurricane Katrina trailers that may contain toxic levels of formaldehyde  and a full investigation on why federal authorities refused to test occupied trailers for the gas after multiple complaints and incidents were reported from hurricane victims   The amendment that was included in the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Appropriations bill that the Senate approved last night  was in response to revelations that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  decided against testing occupied trailers for high levels of formaldehyde in FEMA provided trailers  despite complaints since March 2006 from hurricane victims living in them   According to FEMA  many trailer residents complained of frequent coughing  bloody noses  respiratory disorders and  in at least one case  reported a possible death from potential overexposure to the invisible gas  and reports indicate that FEMA continued to deny there was a problem for over a year  A recent House oversight hearing revealed that the agency   s Office of General Counsel recommended that FEMA not test for formaldehyde  and ordered that all decisions about testing trailers and getting information out to disaster victims about possible formaldehyde problems be run through their office first  giving the appearance that FEMA was putting potential legal liability ahead of public safety concerns  While FEMA officials have acknowledged they made mistakes and will take    swift action     the fact that the first reports to FEMA of toxic fumes occurred in March 2006 and they   re only acting now indicate that Congress should make sure this situation is immediately and adequately addressed  As a result  the Amendment would  Direct DHS Inspector General to investigate the decisions made regarding the trailer formaldehyde problem  The IG will report their findings and their recommendations to Congress  FEMA must  with input from the Centers for Disease for Control and the Environmental Protection Agency  design a program to scientifically test a representative sample of the trailers and mobile homes for formaldehyde  and then have both short and long term testing performed   This is in contrast with the reported    sniff    tests that some FEMA workers conducted that only involved inhaling to see if they could smell the gas   FEMA must report the results of the tests to Congress and  if it determines there are health risks  tell Congress their plan for relocating or assisting the impacted residents and their plan for selling or transferring surplus trailers    Within 15 days of enactment  FEMA must report to Congress on what action it has taken regarding their response to concerns over formaldehyde exposure   This report will include any disciplinary action the agency has taken on those involved in the decisions made on testing   Within 30 days of enactment  FEMA must ensure that the training practices for customer service employees  legal counsel  and other employees are updated as appropriate in relation to addressing the health concerns of recipients of FEMA assistance      We can take two attitudes in government  We can take the attitude that we want to try to look good or we can take the attitude that we re here to serve the public     Senator McCaskill said     This not only sets an important precedent for accountability  but frankly  this Congress has a solemn obligation to make sure we get to the bottom of this  Our job here is to protect the people we serve and not to protect government officials      The Bush Administration s response to Katrina was not only a logistical failure  it was a moral failure     said Senator Obama      Instead of deploying the resources necessary to save lives and rebuild communities  we find another report that the Bush Administration cut corners and buried the truth   This amendment will initiate an investigation into why the Administration failed to respond to reports of a toxic gas contaminating FEMA provided trailers and whether this environmental hazard continues to pose a threat to the victims of Katrina      It shouldn t take an act of Congress for FEMA to act in the best interest of those it should be serving  but it has   Senator Pryor said   I am pleased to join Senators McCaskill and Obama in moving this matter to the forefront and standing up for the health and welfare of hurricane victims      We must make sure that disaster victims are safe from deadly carcinogens when they rely on the federal government for temporary housing     Sen  Landrieu said      It is gravely troubling that FEMA would distribute trailers that they knew to have unacceptable levels of formaldehyde   This amendment will require a necessary report to determine the health risks in FEMA trailers so that victims     some of whom have lost their homes and all of their possessions     are not housed in a trailer that is dangerous to their health      Americans ought to be able to trust that their government won t knowingly expose them to risk     Senator Kerry said      This amendment will get us the answers we need to determine whether FEMA exposed evacuees to dangerous toxins   Senator Johnson said     In March of 2006  I pushed to have these mobile homes put to good use in Indian Country   More than a year after the process started and almost two years after Hurricane Katrina  we find out that the manufacturers built mobile homes and travel trailers that may be toxic   FEMA clearly has a problem with emergency housing they have not addressed   This directive will force the agency to take care of the problems before these mobile homes and travel trailers are sent to Indian Country or future natural disaster victims
