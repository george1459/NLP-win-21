   Obama Joins Senators to Call for Investigation of PBCG Pension Payments   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Senators to Call for Investigation of PBCG Pension Payments Wednesday  July  2  2008  For Immediate Release  Contacts  Meghan Dubyak  Brown  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Senators Cite Cases in Which Pension Beneficiaries Have Been Asked to Repay Thousands of Dollars in Benefits to PBGC   WASHINGTON  D C    Thirteen U S  Senators today called for an investigation of how the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  calculates payments when it assumes responsibility for private pensions  The Senators cited several examples in which retirees have been asked to pay back thousands of dollars worth of overpayments that resulted from incorrect PBGC pension estimates   Retirees should be able to count on a reliable source of income   said Senator Brown  who led the letter requesting the GAO investigation   Individuals living on fixed incomes should not suffer when PBGC s initial estimates are way off or there are unjustifiable delays in finalizing pension payments    Retired folks depend on their pensions to make ends meet  and information gathered by the GAO will help to ensure that seniors can depend on PBGC to get their payments right   said Senator Baucus   Particularly in this turbulent economy  retirees deserve the peace of mind in knowing they will not receive sharp and sudden cuts in their pension benefits because of bureaucratic delays   Senator Bayh said   We have a responsibility to our seniors to take a comprehensive look at the procedures that this congressionally chartered entity utilizes to ensure fair and timely benefit calculations    More than two million Pennsylvanians have their pensions insured by the PBGC   said Senator Casey    Every step must be taken to ensure they receive the correct benefit from PCGC    For seniors and retirees who worked hard for many years and now depend on pensions  reliability is essential  They deserve a transparent and predictable payment process  not the fear that their expected income might suddenly disappear because of a bureaucratic error   Senator Clinton said   I urge PBGC to investigate these troubling reports and make the necessary improvements  Our retirees have earned a system that works     Millions of Americans rely on their pensions to make retirement comfortable and secure and PBGC has a responsibility to provide timely and accurate payments   Senator Durbin said   Miscalculations have resulted in real hardship for America s retirees and we need to get to the bottom of it  I hope this study will allow problems to be identified so that they can be promptly addressed and corrected       An independent assessment by the Government Accountability Office is part of an overall review of how the PBGC makes important calculations  Congress needs to make sure administrative actions by the PBGC don t make things worse for pensioners who are already in a tough situation   Senator Grassley said   The PBGC is responsible for protecting the pensions of millions of Americans and we in Congress are responsible for watching over the PBGC  I am proud to join my colleagues to request this study to help the PBGC better serve the retirees whose pensions they are responsible for   said Senator Mikulski  who chairs the HELP Committee s Retirement and Aging Subcommittee   I know first hand how workers and retirees can be hurt when a factory closes  because it happened to thousands of my constituents at Bethlehem Steel in Baltimore  I will always fight for these hard working men and women and their families to protect what they worked so hard to build    Americans deserve to retire with a stable income  health care benefits and retirement security   said Senator Obama   We must ensure that these retirees are not burdened with unfair and erroneous costs as a result of inaccurate PBGC estimates  I urge the GAO to immediately examine any miscalculations in this process   The pensions of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees are insured by the PBGC  PBGC is responsible for collecting premiums from plan sponsors and for providing timely and uninterrupted pension payments if plan sponsors file for bankruptcy or terminate plans   When PBGC assumes responsibility for payments  it initially pays a retiree an estimated benefit until it calculates the final amount that beneficiary will receive  However  it often takes PBGC several years to calculate the final benefit amount  When the final benefit amount is lower than the estimated payment  not only do PBGC beneficiaries begin receiving lower pension payments  but they must return the overpayment accrued over time  This often results in financial hardship for retirees living on fixed incomes  The Senators have requested that GAO study several aspects of PBGC performance to determine how its benefit determination process could be improved  Specifically  they requested that GAO    Explain how PBGC estimates initial benefits Determine why there have been noted delays in making final benefit determinations Examine the extent to which retiree benefits change significantly when they become final and the reasons for these changes Examine the discrepancies between negotiated and guaranteed benefits for those retirees whose benefit plans have come under PBGC administration due to plan termination Examine how the PBGC appeals process functions  including the ease of participant access to the process and the length of time that passes awaiting decision    A copy of the letter is below  July 1  2008  Gene Dodaro  Acting Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Dodaro    We are writing to request a GAO assessment of the process by which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  estimates retiree benefits for corporations that it insures  We are concerned about the impact this process has on pension recipients who have suffered lost paychecks  health benefits  and retirement security in the face of economic volatility and outsourcing   The PBGC protects the pensions of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees in over 30 000 employer sponsored defined benefit pension plans  PBGC s primary responsibility is to collect premiums from plan sponsors and to provide timely and uninterrupted benefit payments when terminations or bankruptcies occur  In the event of plan terminations  PBGC assumes control of plan assets  calculates benefit amounts  and pays recipients a guaranteed benefit  PBGC initially pays retirees an estimated benefit without interruption  but routinely takes several years to calculate the final benefit amount  At times  the final benefit amount is significantly different than initially estimated  In these cases  recipients may face a considerable decrease in monthly payments and may also be forced to pay back overpayments  creating significant financial hardship   The most recent example concerns employees of Republic Technologies International  RTI   a steel company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 and terminated its pension plans for employees in Ohio  Illinois  Indiana  New York  and Pennsylvania in 2002  Although PBGC assumed immediate control of the terminated RTI pension plan  final benefit determinations were not made until this past spring   almost 6 years later  RTI retirees now face significant decreases in monthly benefit payments  some of up to 70 percent  These benefit reductions are compounded by a recoupment policy that has left many retirees in debt to PBGC  some up to  75 000  In light of these circumstances  we are requesting that GAO study several aspects of PBGC performance to determine how its benefit determination process can be improved  Specifically  we would like GAO to determine  1  how PBGC estimates initial benefits  2  why there have been noted instances in which there have been delays in making final benefit determinations  3  to examine the extent to which retiree benefits change significantly when they become final and the reasons for these changes  4  to examine the discrepancies between negotiated and guaranteed benefits for those retirees whose benefit plans have come under PBGC administration due to plan termination  and 5  to examine how the PBGC appeals process functions  including the ease of participant access to the process and the length of time that passes awaiting decision  We would also welcome GAO s recommendations for ways to mitigate any negative impact of PBGC processes on retires and to make benefit determination faster and more accurate  thus improving the service PBGC provides  Thank you for your cooperation in addressing these matters   Please contact Cathy Zebrowski in Senator Brown s office at 224 0719 if you have any questions    Sincerely    Senator Max Baucus Senator Evan Bayh Senator Sherrod Brown Senator Richard Burr Senator Robert P  Casey Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Senator Richard Durbin Senator Mike Enzi Senator Chuck Grassley Senator Edward Kennedy Senator Barbara Mikulski Senator Barack Obama Senator Arlen Specter
