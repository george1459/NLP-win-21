  202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 8  2006  Obama Testifies About Plan to Reduce Lobbyist Influence and Clean Up Washington   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today testified before the Senate Rules Committee about legislation he has introduced to help increase transparency and accountability in government and help clean up Washington    Below  please find Senator Obama s testimony as well as a more detailed explanation of the legislation   TESTIMONY OF SENATOR BARACK OBAMA  SENATE RULES COMMITTEE  FEBRUARY 8  2006   Chairman Lott  Senator Dodd  thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today about this important subject    I m here to testify about three pieces of legislation that I ve played a role in drafting and that I believe are worth serious consideration by this Committee    Since the very first time I spoke out on lobbying reform  I have said over and over what I still believe to be true today   that while some are clearly to blame for the corruption that has plagued Washington  all of us   Democrats and Republicans   are responsible for cleaning it up   That s why I hope to work in a bipartisan manner on reform  and that s what I hope this legislation can provide a foundation for        The first bill is the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act  which already has the support of 41 members of the Senate   The bill takes a number of significant steps to fundamentally change the way we do business in Washington     First  it would lengthen the cooling off period to two years for lawmakers and staff who seek to become lobbyists  and it would require immediate disclosure as soon as any job negotiations begin   This would end the stories we ve heard about working on a prescription drug bill during the day while you re talking about your future salary with the drug industry at night     Second  the bill would open conference committee meetings to the public and require that all bills be posted on the Internet for 24 hours before they re voted on  so the public can scrutinize them to prevent special interest provisions from being slipped in during the dead of night       Third  the bill would end all lobbyist funded gifts  meals  and travel and strengthen the Senate office that monitors lobbyist disclosure forms     If enacted  this bill would go a long way towards ending the cozy relationship between lawmakers and lobbyists   But I believe we can take some additional key steps   And that s why I m introducing two more bills today    The first deals with enforcement   We can pass all the new ethics rules in the world  but if we don t establish a body that can monitor and enforce those rules  it ll be easy to break them   That s why this bill calls for a nonpartisan  independent Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission   This Commission would be staffed with former judges and former members of Congress  and it would allow any citizen to report a possible ethics violation by lawmakers  staff  or lobbyists   The Commission would have the authority to conduct investigations  issue subpoenas  and provide public reports to the Senate Ethics Committee or Department of Justice so that any wrongdoing can be punished accordingly        To prevent this Commission from being manipulated for partisan political purposes  the bill establishes stiff sanctions for the filing of frivolous complaints  and prohibits the filing of complaints 30 days before a primary election and 60 days before a general election    This proposal is modeled after similar commissions in Kentucky  Florida  and Tennessee that have worked very well   particularly in Kentucky    I believe it s a good model for how to reform our ethics process in Congress  and I m pleased that this bill is supported by Common Cause    Norm Ornstein at the American Enterprise Institute  who is an expert on the workings of Congress  has said this about my enforcement bill    This approach to ethics enforcement is just the kind of balanced and reasonable alternative we need   Enforcement of ethics in Congress needs independence and credibility to all  but cannot become either a vehicle for the criminalization of policy differences or an avenging angel like the Independent Counsel statute created    This commission would have on it people of integrity and institutional sensitivity  and could serve to educate members and staff about ethical behavior and performance while also providing vigorous and credible enforcement of ethical standards   It deserves strong bipartisan support     I m also introducing a second bill today that would bring greater transparency to earmarks so that we can save taxpayer dollars and end the special interest abuse of this process   This is area that many of our colleagues are interested in reforming   Sen  McCain has already discussed the proposals that he s working on with Sen  Coburn   And I know Chairman Lott and Sen  Feinstein have introduced an earmarks bill as well    The bill I am proposing today builds on the earmark provisions in the CLEAN UP Act that I introduced last month with eight senators and includes language from a proposal by Rep  Obey   My new bill would require that information about all earmarks  including the name of the lawmaker requesting it and a justification of why they want it  be disclosed 72 hours before they are considered by the full Senate     The bill would also place some common sense limits on earmarks   Members would be prohibited from advocating for an earmark if they have a financial interest in the project or its recipient   Earmarks also could not be used to secure promises from lawmakers in exchange for a vote on a bill   These earmark reforms won t solve every abuse  but the idea is this   if you re proud enough about an earmark to issue a press release about it  then you should be able to defend it to the public     I hope that this committee will take into consideration these proposals as well as others that can serve as the basis for real and effective lobbying reform   Again  I hope to do this in a bipartisan manner   But I will say this   the true test of bipartisanship is not whether we pass a bill that appeals to a lowest common denominator that we can all agree on  it s whether we pass the strongest bill with the strongest reforms possible that can truly change the way we do business in Washington   That s what the American people will be watching for  and that s what we owe them in the end    THE CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION ACT Senator Barack Obama has proposing the creation of a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission to receive complaints from the public on alleged ethics violations by members of Congress  staff  and lobbyists   The Commission would have authority to investigate complaints and present public findings of fact about possible violations to the House and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department   This proposal  which is endorsed by Common Cause and Norm Ornstein  is modeled after similar state commissions in Kentucky  Florida  and Tennessee   Composition  The Commission would be comprised of nine Commissioners chosen by the leaders of Congress   Four of the Commissioners must be former federal judges  and four must be former members of Congress   During their service  Commissioners would be prohibited from serving as a fundraiser for a Senate or House candidate  contributing to a candidate for federal office  serving as an officer in a political party  acting as a registered lobbyist  and participating in the management or conduct of a political campaign   Investigative Powers  In conducting its investigations of alleged violations  the Commission would have the authority to issue subpoenas  compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents  and take depositions    All Commission proceedings  including the initial complaint  would remain confidential until a final determination is made   Following a preliminary investigation of a complaint  the Commission would have several options   dismiss the complaint  confidentially inform the alleged violator of potential violations and provide information to ensure future compliance with the law  or upon a majority vote  initiate an adjudicatory proceeding to determine whether to present a case to the House and Senate Ethics Committee or the Department of Justice  The House and Senate Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice would retain the ultimate authority to discipline members of Congress   Frivolous Complaints  To avoid manipulation of the Commission for political purposes  any person filing a complaint that they knew to be false would be subject to a  10 000 fine and up to one year in jail   That person also would be barred from filing any future complaints    No complaints could be filed against a member of Congress in the three months prior to an election to ensure that complaints are not filed for political purposes   THE INTEGRITY IN EARMARKS ACT   Senator Barack Obama has proposed a bill to increase transparency and accountability in earmarks   The bill would require the following   All earmarks  including the name of the requestor and a justification for the earmark  would be disclosed 72 hours before they can be considered by the full Senate   All earmarks would have to be listed in the actual bill  not just the committee report   All earmarks would have to be germane to the bill in which they are contained   Senators would be prohibited from advocating for an earmark if they have a financial interest in the project or earmark recipient   Earmarks may not be used to secure promises from senators that they will vote a certain way on a bill   Earmark recipients must disclose to an Office of Public Integrity the amount that they have spent on registered lobbyists and the names of those lobbyists
