VA Oversight Thursday  October 11  2007  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama  Inadequate background check may have put veterans at risk WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Gordon Mansfield asking questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez who has been linked to some extent to the recent spike in deaths at the Marion VA Medical Center   A cursory check of publicly available information by staff members from both Senate offices uncovered questionable information that should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation by the VA      It appears the VA   s efforts to discover the truth about Dr  Veizaga Mendez  his past professional history  and the circumstances surrounding his license forfeiture were far from adequate and may have put the veterans seeking care at Marion in danger     the Illinois Senators wrote      This is an extremely alarming revelation that calls into question the adequacy of the oversight exercised by the VA as it evaluates and monitors those who provide care to our veterans      On September 14  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths   Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed   During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  In an October 3 meeting with Senator Durbin  Dr  Michael Kussman  Under Secretary of VA for Health and Dr  Gerald Cross  Principal Deputy Under Secretary insisted that the VA could not have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed     Both Senators Durbin and Obama have actively pressed the VA for information on the situation at the Marion VA Medical Center   Last month  they sent a letter to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  asking specific questions about the VA   s response to the increase in deaths at the center   They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August    This followed a September 17 letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation   In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated   text of letter below and attached October 11  2007 The Honorable Gordon Mansfield  Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Mansfield  We are writing to follow up on two previous letters we sent to Secretary Nicholson last month with regard to the situation at the Marion  IL  Veterans Administration Medical Center  VAMC  and specifically on the hiring and employment of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez   Continued revelations about Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s record both before and during his employment at the Marion VAMC have raised serious concerns about the adequacy of the VA   s credentialing and quality control systems  In our letter to Secretary Nicholson of September 24  we asked him to explain the background check process that is conducted by the VA before hiring medical staff   Additionally  specific concerns regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s employment were raised directly with Undersecretary Kussman and Deputy Undersecretary Cross in a meeting last week   Dr  Kussman and Dr  Cross both insisted that the VA had conducted due diligence when it became aware that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his medical license in Massachusetts   They asserted that there was no way the VA could have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed   However  a cursory check by our staff of publicly available information has cast doubt on the validity of that claim   Although our staff did not have access to the full range of information that hospitals and state medical boards have  we were still able to uncover questionable information about Dr  Veizaga Mendez of sufficient magnitude that it should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation before the VA continued to entrust the lives of our veterans to his care  It appears the VA   s efforts to discover the truth about Dr  Veizaga Mendez  his past professional history  and the circumstances surrounding his license forfeiture were far from adequate and may have put the veterans seeking care at Marion in danger   This is an extremely alarming revelation that calls into question the adequacy of the oversight exercised by the VA as it evaluates and monitors those who provide care to our veterans   We have specific questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Veizaga Mendez and on the oversight of care givers throughout the VA Medical System      1  An October 5  2007  Associated Press article cites Pete McBrady  acting director of the Marion VAMC  as saying that the VAMC    has a board consisting of a group of practicing physicians at the hospital who vet each candidate for hire    and that    there was no evidence that would set off any alarms about Veizaga Mendez with the Marion panel when they reviewed the doctor      Prior to hiring Dr  Veizaga Mendez  what inquiries did the VAMC make to public or private sources concerning his qualifications   What specific evidence did the VAMC obtain when it reviewed Dr  Veizaga Mendez prior to his hiring   2  Did the VAMC contact the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine  Massachusetts Board  regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s qualifications prior to his hiring   3  We have been informed by the Massachusetts Board that the Board operates a publicly accessible internet site featuring profiles of physicians licensed in Massachusetts   We also have been informed that when he was hired by the Marion VAMC in January 2006  Dr  Veizaga Mendez had a profile on the Massachusetts Board   s internet site that would have disclosed  at minimum  that he had been the subject of a hospital disciplinary action in 2004  and that he made two medical malpractice payments  one in 2004 and one in 2005    Did the VAMC access the Massachusetts Board   s internet profile of Dr  Veizaga Mendez before hiring him   If so  what was the VA   s response to the information contained in the profile   4  Dr  Veizaga Mendez voluntarily surrendered his Massachusetts license in July 2006   How was the VA notified he had surrendered his license  What investigation was undertaken by the VA to determine the cause and circumstances   Was the VA informed about allegations of professional misconduct against Dr  Veizaga Mendez that were made by the Massachusetts Board   5  Did Dr  Veizaga Mendez provide any written representations regarding the surrender of his Massachusetts license   If so  what were those representations   6  We have been informed that Dr  Veizaga Mendez has filed an appeal before the Massachusetts Division of Administrative Law Appeals in response to allegations raised by the Massachusetts Board   Was the VA aware of any such appeal    7  According to regulations governing the Massachusetts Board  the VA is not explicitly included on a list of    designated agencies    that are entitled to request and view non public information from the Massachusetts Board   Why is the VA not included on this list   Are there other states in which the VA is not entitled to request and review non public information from state medical licensing boards   What steps  if any  has the VA taken to address this flaw in the VA   s access to information about physicians   8  What assurances can you provide us that there are not other cases of similar circumstances at the Marion VAMC and at other VA hospitals   9  What steps are you taking to ensure that troubling information about VA physicians is not overlooked in the future   Due to the seriousness of this issue  we would appreciate a prompt response    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin                                                                                  United States Senator                                                                              Barack Obama  United States Senator   Cc  Dr  Michael Kussman         Dr  Gerald Cross
