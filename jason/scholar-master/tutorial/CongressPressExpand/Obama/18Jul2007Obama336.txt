   Obama Statement on Senate Debate Over Redeploying U S  Troops from Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Senate Debate Over Redeploying U S  Troops from Iraq Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt       WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the all night Senate debate over redeploying U S  troops from Iraq   Obama is a co sponsor of the Levin Reed amendment and the sponsor of the Iraq De Escalation Act   The text is below     We have heard from the Administration and from many of our colleagues in this chamber that we need to give the President s surge more time  that we need to wait to hear the report in September before we make a binding decision to redeploy our troops   Yet  we learned just last week that the Iraqi political leaders have not met a single benchmark that they had agreed to in January   Not one                          We do not need to wait for another report  We have seen the results of a failed policy in the form of multiple deployments  more sacrifice from our military families  and a deepening civil war in Iraq that has caught our troops in the middle             It is long past time to turn the page in Iraq  where each day we see the consequences of fighting a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged   The single most important decision a President or Member of Congress can make is the decision to send our troops into harm s way              It is that decision that determines the fate of our men and women in uniform  the course of nations  and the security of the American people   It is that decision that sets in motion consequences that cannot be undone             Since this war began  3 618 Americans have been killed     532 since the President ignored the will of the American people and launched his surge   Tens of thousands more have been wounded  suffering terrible injuries seen and unseen                         Here is what else we know   We know that the surge is not working  that our mission in Iraq must be changed  and that this war must be brought to a responsible conclusion             We know Iraq s leaders are not resolving their grievances   They are not stepping up to their security responsibilities   They are not improving the daily lives of Iraqis             We know that the war in Iraq costs us  370 million dollars a day and  10 billion each month   These are resources that could be spent to secure our ports and our borders  and to focus on a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan and the wider war on terrorism that is yet to be won             We know that because of the war in Iraq  America is no safer than it was on 9 11   Al Qaeda has gained the best recruiting tool it could ask for   Tens of thousands of terrorists have been trained and radicalized in Iraq   And terrorism is up worldwide          If America is attacked again  it will be in no small measure a consequence of our failure to destroy al Qaeda at its roots in Afghanistan and our failure to adequately secure the homeland   The decision to authorize and fight a misguided war in Iraq has created a new cadre of experienced terrorists bent on the destruction of the United States and our allies          If there   s still any question about whether Iraq has been a distraction from this critical war in Afghanistan and Pakistan  that should have been resolved yesterday with the release of the most recent National Intelligence Estimate    That report said that al Qaeda    has protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability  including  a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas  operational lieutenants  and its top leadership          And last week  a new threat assessment concluded that al Qaeda is as strong today as it was before 9 11          Seeing yet another report like this  I can only repeat what I said nearly five years ago  during the run up to this war   We are fighting on the wrong battlefield   The terrorists who attacked us and who continue to plot against us are resurgent in the hills between Afghanistan and Pakistan   They should have been our focus then   They must be our focus now          I opposed this war from the beginning  before the Congress voted to authorize the war in 2002   I said then that I could not support a war based not on reason but on passion  not on principle but on politics   I worried that it would lead to a US occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences          I believed then     and I still believe now     that being a leader means that you d better do what s right and leave the politics aside   Because there are no do overs on an issue as important as war   You cannot undo the consequences of that decision         In January  I introduced a plan that would have already started bringing our troops home and ending this war  with a goal of removing all combat brigades by March 31  2008  Seventy eight days ago  President Bush vetoed a bipartisan plan that passed both houses of Congress that shared my goal of changing course and ending this war          During those 78 days  266 Americans have died  and the situation in Iraq has continued to deteriorate         It   s time to set a hard date to signal a new mission in Iraq and to begin to bring our troops home   It   s time to ensure that we complete the change in mission and the drawdown of our forces  by the end of April 2008     a date that is consistent with the date in my plan back in January          As we redeploy from Iraq     as I believe we must do     we have to redouble our efforts on all fronts in Afghanistan to ensure we do not lose ground there          Certainly  we   ve had some success there over the last five and half years  whether it   s the five fold increase in the number of Afghan boys and girls now attending schools or the free elections of a president and parliament          Yet the remaining challenges in Afghanistan are enormous   Opium production is expected to reach a record high this year  with revenues helping to fuel the Taliban and al Qaeda   The Taliban has increased its campaign of suicide attacks and roadside bombings in recent months   Most troubling  Mr  President  is this simple fact   The leaders of Al Qaeda     Osama bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Al Zawahiri     and the leader of the Taliban  Mullah Omar  remain at large   They are now free to operate in a safe haven in northwest Pakistan   That has to change          First  the United States must increase reconstruction efforts  on both the civilian and military side   If we are serious about winning the war on terror  we must shift to greater investments in winning the hearts and minds of Afghans   The U S  should allocate money in a way that allows more flexibility in our spending  permitting funding of local projects that benefit communities and promising local governments          Second  the U S  and NATO must turn around the security situation so that average Afghans regain their faith in the ability of their government and the international forces to ensure their security   Despite more than five years of an international military presence in their country  the sad reality is that most Afghans do not believe their government can guarantee their safety
