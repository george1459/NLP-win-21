   Obama and McCaskill Applaud Passage of Wounded Warrior Legislation   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama and McCaskill Applaud Passage of Wounded Warrior Legislation Wednesday  July 25  2007  For Immediate Release                    Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  or Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill    Also urge president to act on commission recommendations released today WASHINGTON  D C      As the President   s Commission on Care for America   s Returning Wounded made recommendations to the Bush Administration concerning care for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  the U S  Senate unanimously approved legislation inspired by U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO    s Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act   Both Obama and McCaskill applauded the Senate   s actions to improve health care and the recovery process for service members and their families  and called on President Bush to move quickly in implementing the Commission recommendations in order to provide further protection from military men and women  Like the Obama McCaskill legislation  today   s successful legislation would cut Pentagon red tape  improve military medical facilities  and increase oversight at our nation   s military hospitals         This bill goes a long way toward providing our service members with the treatment and facilities they and their families need to heal and rebuild their lives     said Senator Obama     Today   s recommendations offered by the President   s Commission  which also include some of our proposals from the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  remind us that we must do more work to ensure that our wounded warriors don   t have to wage another battle when they return home   Providing the best care for our returning service members  veterans and their families is one thing about this war we can still get right        Earlier this year when the Walter Reed scandal broke and the nation read about the unacceptable conditions our injured troops were facing when they returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator Obama and I proposed necessary changes to ensure that would never happen again  I   m pleased that today the Senate has adopted a measure that includes many of those changes     McCaskill said     Our brave young men and women sign up to fight for freedom at home and abroad  they do not sign up to have to fight for adequate medical care when they return      The bill that passed the Senate today includes several Obama McCaskill provisions such as improving living conditions at military facilities  enhancing mental health care for recovering service members  slashing red tape to ease the healing process  providing health care to family members assisting recovering service members  and reforming the broken military disability review process   The bill also adopts other Obama McCaskill legislation  the HERO Act  which would launch a major national research endeavor into the readjustment needs of returning service members  veterans and their families     Today   s service members and their families face a unique set of needs that must be identified and addressed   To provide them with the best care  comprehensive legislation should also include other provisions McCaskill and Obama have fought for  such as  Strengthen protections for service members against improper discharges for service connected mental health conditions  Provide important federal job protections for family members on invitational orders   A mother or father should never have to choose between caring for a wounded son and keeping their jobs   Require post deployment  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members       Obama and McCaskill also noted that the Presidential Commission   s report reflects many findings the senators made last winter and subsequently incorporated into their legislation   Along with other recommendations  the Commission  created by President Bush in the aftermath of the Walter Reed scandal and co chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E  Shalala  specifically seeks expanded job protections for family members who are assisting recovering service members in military hospitals   Similarly  McCaskill and Obama recently offered an amendment to the defense authorization bill to provide 12 months of job protection to these family members   Today  they said they will continue to fight for passage of this provision     Senators Obama and McCaskill first introduced this legislation in February following the revelations of extreme neglect at the Walter Reed facilities   In March  they offered key provisions of the legislation as an amendment to the Iraq Supplemental Bill  which was rejected by Senate Republicans    Senator Obama serves on the Veterans    Affairs Committee and Senator McCaskill serves on the Armed Services Committee
