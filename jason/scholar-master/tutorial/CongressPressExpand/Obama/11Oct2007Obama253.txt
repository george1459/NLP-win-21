    Obama Asks Rice to Address Violence Against Women in the Congo Thursday  October 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511                                                         WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today wrote to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing his concerns about the growing number of systematic sexual assaults against women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago  Obama asked Secretary Rice to answer a series of questions about the situation in the DRC and what the United States government is doing to help curb this violence against women  In December of 2005  Obama introduced The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo  The legislation was signed into law on December 22  2006    Below is a copy of the letter  October 10  2007    The Honorable Condoleezza Rice   Secretary of State  Department of State  Washington  D C  20520   Dear Secretary Rice     I am writing to express my concern about the escalation of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago      The violence has been marked  in particular  by systematic sexual assaults against women   In 2004  Amnesty International estimated that at least 40 000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the DRC since 1998   In 2006  the United Nations reported 27 000 sexual assaults against women and girls in South Kivu province alone   Human Rights Watch has documented cases of rape victims as young as three years old   The New York Times recently reported that  in one town in the DRC  70 percent of Congolese women reported being sexually brutalized   The perpetrators     including disgruntled government soldiers  homegrown militia groups  and former Hutu militiamen who fled into Congo s forests after participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide     have sustained their armed conflicts by exploiting the country s natural resources  raiding villages and committing violent atrocities    The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which I introduced in December 2005 and which was signed into law by President Bush on December 22  2006  identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo   That law states  in part  that U S  policy shall be to     urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces  hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations  particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war  accountable and bring such individuals to justice        help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health  education  and psycho social support programs        work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  MONUC  to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards  promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions  and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo       In that regard  I ask that you provide responses to the following questions     1     Do you have reason to believe that any DRC armed forces have been involved in mass rapes in the eastern DRC during the recent violence      2     What mechanisms exist to investigate and report on allegations of such violence     3     What  if any  investigations have been undertaken  and what have been the results of such investigations      4     To date  have any individuals been held accountable for such violence     5     What is the nature of U S  support for efforts to build the new Congolese armed forces and what elements of that support  if any  raise awareness about the importance of this issue of sexual violence      6     Is any U S  support contingent on the DRC government taking steps to address this issue     7     What steps  if any  is the U S  taking diplomatically to develop a consensus position among all donors contributing to the rebuilding of the Congolese armed force about the importance of addressing sexual violence     8     What resources has the United States government dedicated to victims of sexual violence over the course of the last six years     9     How is the U S  ensuring that the UN  and all countries that contribute troops to MONUC  are abiding by codes of conduct for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking     I thank you in advance for the consideration of these questions  and I look forward to your prompt reply    Sincerely     Barack Obama   United States Senator
