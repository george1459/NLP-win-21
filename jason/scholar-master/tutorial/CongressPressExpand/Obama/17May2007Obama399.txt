   Obama Statement on Immigration Reform Developments   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Immigration Reform Developments Thursday  May 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  DC       Over the past two years  I have worked hard for a comprehensive immigration bill that would provide strong border security  create a new employment verification system  rationalize our immigration quotas  and bring the 12 million undocumented immigrants out of hiding and put them on an earned path to citizenship  We need this reform now          I applaud the Senate leadership  as well as the bipartisan group of Senators who negotiated this deal  for moving the legislative process forward   Over the past few months  much hard work has been done behind closed doors to reach agreement on how to fix our immigration system while staying true to our values   But I believe more work needs to be done          Without modifications  the proposed bill could devalue the importance of family reunification  replace the current group of undocumented immigrants with a new undocumented population consisting of guestworkers who will overstay their visas  and potentially drive down wages of American workers   We may need a new worker visa to bring in people at all levels of our economy  but these workers should not be forced out of our country or into hiding after two or three years if they prove themselves worthy of an opportunity to stay and join the American family   These and other problems with the proposed deal should be substantially modified          We need to fix our immigration system  but we should not replace one dysfunctional  broken system with another equally troubled system   So  I will work to improve any bill that comes to the floor of the Senate  and I hope to be able to support a final bill at the end of the legislative process
