2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACTS  Liz Richardson Kerry   Michael Ortiz Obama   Liz Farrar  Ellsworth   or Kathleen Connery  Emanuel   Reform Closes Offshore Tax Loopholes that Government Contractors Use To Dodge Social Security Taxes  WASHINGTON  DC   Sens  John Kerry  D Mass   and Barack Obama  D Ill   are introducing the  Fair Share Act of 2008   today with Reps  Brad Ellsworth  IN  and Rahm Emanuel  D Ill   The reform will close the loophole that recently has allowed the defense contractor KBR Inc  to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year   It was discovered that KBR has avoided paying its fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Setting up sham companies in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying Social Security taxes for workers turns the idea of patriotism on its head  No wonder Americans are disgusted with Washington when big corporations profit from no bid contracts for the war in Iraq  then hide money and costs offshore to avoid paying taxes while hard working Americans get stuck with the bill   said Sen  Kerry    KBR is abusing the public trust at the taxpayer s expense  and our reform will close the loophole that enables big corporations to take advantage of the American people     American companies have a responsibility to pay taxes  and guarantee that their employees will receive the Medicare and Social Security benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Sen  Obama    It s unacceptable for Federal contractors to use foreign affiliates or tax shelters in order to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes and to shirk on their basic obligations to American workers   This critical legislation will increase accountability and transparency of our tax system  and ensure that Federal contractors who are working on behalf of the American taxpayer do not abuse the tax system    These government contractors have been receiving millions  sometimes billions  in taxpayer dollars  Yet they still have the audacity to circumvent our tax system and cheat their workers  the taxpayers  and our government   said Rep  Ellsworth   It s clear Congress cannot stand by and hope these companies will do the right thing  The Fair Share Act restores some needed accountability to the government contracting process  protecting American workers and ensuring all companies compete on an equal playing field    Honest middle class American taxpayers who pay their taxes deserve a tax system where companies cannot use every trick in the book to rig the system to avoid paying their fair share   said Rep  Emanuel   Known best this week as the company who gave our troops tainted water  KBR is taking advantage of a tax loophole that hurts Social Security and Medicare and prevents their own U S  employees working abroad from being able to qualify for these vital programs  And just like we did in 2004 when we closed the Bermuda loophole that allowed companies to lower their taxes by setting up a mailing address in Bermuda  we are going to shut down this egregious loophole   Summary of the Legislation The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes   The legislation will apply to foreign subsidiaries of a U S  parent   The degree of common ownership applied by the legislation is 50 percent  meaning that the U S  parent would have to at least own 50 percent of the subsidiary  In addition  the legislation addresses the situation in which a U S  subsidiary of a foreign corporation subcontracts with a foreign subsidiary to perform a contract with the U S government   In this situation  the legislation would apply to wages paid by the foreign subsidiary to its U S  employees  The legislation does not address the situation in which the foreign parent contracts directly with the U S  government   Present law will continue to apply to totalization agreements   Effective Date of Legislation  This legislation applies to services performed after the date of enactment
