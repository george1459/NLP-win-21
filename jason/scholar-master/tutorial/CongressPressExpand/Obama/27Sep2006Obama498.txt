   Final Chemical Plant Security Legislation Fails to Adequately Protect American Lives   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Final Chemical Plant Security Legislation Fails to Adequately Protect American Lives Monday  September 25  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Lautenberg Contact  Alex Formuzis   202  224 7340  Date  September 25  2006  Obama  Lautenberg Say Final Chemical Plant Security Legislation is too Weak  Fails to Adequately Protect American Lives   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  today said that the chemical plant security legislation agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators last week is far too weak and fails to adequately protect American lives    The sad truth is that this legislation does far more to protect chemical industry interests than it does to protect the millions of Americans who would be at risk if terrorists were to attack a chemical plant   said Senator Obama   Our inability to secure these sites is one of our greatest security failures since the September 11th attacks      We re five years out from September 11th and America still hasn t secured its chemical facilities from terrorists   Instead of adopting the House and Senate plans to protect the nation s chemical plants  the Republicans and the White House went behind closed doors and cut a deal with the chemical industry   said Senator Lautenberg    There are 111 facilities in the United States where a worst case scenario attack on a chemical plant could threaten more than one million people  according to the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Two of these facilities are within Chicago s city limits  Illinois has at least 11 facilities where a large scale chemical release could threaten more than a million people    While many chemical plant owners have taken steps to beef up security  too many have not  In Illinois  there have been recent reports by ABC 7 in Chicago of chemical plants with dilapidated fences  insufficient guard forces  and unprotected tanks of hazardous chemicals  These plants are basically stationary weapons of mass destruction  Their security is light  their facilities are easily entered  and their contents are deadly    Obama and Lautenberg urged Congressional leaders to take up comprehensive chemical plant security legislation before the end of the year  Both the House and Senate Committees on Homeland Security passed separate chemical plant bills  but neither has been considered by their respective full chambers    Earlier this year  Senators Obama  Lautenberg  Dick Durbin  D IL  and Bob Menendez  D NJ  introduced the Chemical Safety and Security Act of 2006 that would replace current weak voluntary chemical plant security standards with a clear set of federal regulations that all plants must abide by  Plants that are considered a high risk to large population areas or critical infrastructure would face more stringent standards    Plant owners and employees would work together to tailor their security plans to address each individual facility s vulnerabilities  but they would face tough penalties for noncompliance  The bill would also protect the right of states to establish security standards that fit local needs so that states like New Jersey that have been leaders in chemical security do not see their current laws weakened    The bill addresses all methods to reduce risk  including physical security such as security forces  perimeter defenses  hazard mitigation and emergency response  But the bill also requires the use of safer technologies to reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a target  This concept  known as Inherently Safer Technology  involves methods such as changing the flow of chemical processes to avoid dangerous chemical byproducts  reducing the pressures or temperatures of chemical reactions to minimize the risk of explosions  reducing inventories of dangerous chemicals and replacing dangerous chemicals with benign ones  Each one of these methods reduces the danger that chemical plants pose to our communities and makes them less appealing targets for terrorists    This bill explicitly bars DHS from replacing dangerous chemicals with safer alternatives  and it weakens this Administration s ability to better secure these plants   Obama said   There are serious gaps in our nation s chemical plant security  but this legislation falls well short of fixing the problems
