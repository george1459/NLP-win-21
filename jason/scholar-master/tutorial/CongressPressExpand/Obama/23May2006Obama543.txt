                                   Obama Calls on Wal Mart and Other Large National and Regional Stores to Offer Alternative Fuels Monday  May 22  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  May 22  2006  Obama Calls on Wal Mart and Other Large National and Regional Stores to Offer Alternative Fuels  Illinois Senator Says Commitment Would Greatly Increase Consumer Access to E85     WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Mr  H  Lee Scott  Jr   Chief Executive Officer of Wal Mart Stores  Inc   and to other top executives of hypermarket chains  which include major national and regional merchandisers  club stores  discount chains and national supermarket chains  asking them to commit to installing alternative fuel pumps at all store locations that sell gasoline    It is clear that alternative fuels are our energy future   Obama wrote   That market is up for grabs  and the resistance of conventional branded gasoline retailers to offering E 85 at their service stations creates an opportunity for companies like yours     It is estimated that the more than 3 600 hypermarket stores that sell gasoline will comprise up to 15  of national retail fuel sales within three years  Obama said that a commitment from these large companies to sell alternative fuels like E85  a blended fuel comprised of 85  ethanol and 15  gasoline  would greatly increase access to alternative fuels and help make America more energy independent      Given the large size of your company  a decision to offer this product at your retail fuel stations would contribute to building the infrastructure necessary to meet consumer demand and reduce dramatically our nation s reliance on foreign petroleum   Obama wrote   By announcing a new corporate policy to offer alternative fuels at all of your retail refueling stations  your company would demonstrate its commitment to investing in American made fuels and to protecting our nation s energy security and environment     E85 can be used in Flexible Fuel Vehicles  FFVs   which can also use unleaded fuel when E85 isn t available  Standard vehicles can burn fuel with a 10 percent ethanol mix  Ford Motor Co  Vice President Sue Cischke said last week that  We need about 30 times the   E85 ethanol pumps available today   to accommodate the more than 5 million flexible fuel vehicles currently on the road  It is estimated that only approximately 700 of the 165 000 publicly accessible gas stations sell E85    Stores that choose to install alternative fuel pumps would be eligible to receive a tax credit of up to  30 000 to offset the cost of installation  This tax credit was championed by Senator Obama and became law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005    Obama s letter was sent to executives at  Wal Mart Stores  Inc   Safeway  Inc   Costco Wholesale Corporation  The Kroger Company  Meijer  Inc   Albertson s  Inc   BJ s Wholesale Club  Kmart  Bomgaars  Duckwall Alco  Mills Fleet Farm  The Mercantile Corporate Office  SUPERVALU Corporate Headquarters and IGA  Incorporated    Below  please find the full text of Senator Obama s letter   May 22  2006   Dear Executive    The Energy Policy Act  signed into law by the President last year  calls for the production of greater levels of alternative fuels  such as ethanol and biodiesel  by the year 2012  and provides a tax credit for the installation of alternative fuel refueling pumps to expand consumer access to these new fuels    It is estimated that there are more than 3 600 hypermart supermarket gasoline sites in the United States  which could comprise up to 15  of national retail fuel sales within three years   Given that your company and similar mass retailers continue to expand into retail fuel markets  I urge you to commit to the installation of alternative fuel refueling pumps at each of your retail stations so that your customers will have full access to domestically produced  environmentally friendly alternative fuels  such as E 85  which is an 85  renewable ethanol 15  gasoline mixture   The nation is at a crossroads in energy policy   Our choice is to continue to cling to fossil fuels as the cornerstone of our supply  or to take advantage of existing technology and the emerging consumer preference for non petroleum based fuels     It is clear that alternative fuels are our energy future   That market is up for grabs  and the resistance of conventional branded gasoline retailers to offering E 85 at their service stations creates an opportunity for companies like yours     As production capacity of E 85 continues to rise and automakers increase production of flexible fuel vehicles  expanding consumer access to this new fuel is critical and prescient   Given the large size of your company  a decision to offer this product at your retail fuel stations would contribute to building the infrastructure necessary to meet consumer demand and reduce dramatically our nation s reliance on foreign petroleum   Moreover  by announcing a new corporate policy to offer alternative fuels at all of your retail refueling stations  your company would demonstrate its commitment to investing in American made fuels and to protecting our nation s energy security and environment     I appreciate your consideration of this request    Sincerely    Barack Obama           United States Senator
