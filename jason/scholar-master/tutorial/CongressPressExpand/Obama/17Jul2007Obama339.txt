   Senators Propose New Help for Workers During Mass Layoffs   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Propose New Help for Workers During Mass Layoffs Tuesday  July 17  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Bethany Lesser  Brown   Ben LaBolt  Obama   or Sarah Gegenheimer  Clinton  Brown  Obama  Clinton Want to Strengthen19 Year Old Plant Closing Law Washington  DC     U S  Senator Sherrod Brown  joined by Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   late last night introduced new legislation that would notify workers of mass firings or plant closings and add tools to enforce current law  The Federal Oversight  Reform  and Enforcement of the WARN Act  FOREWARN   S 1792  would amend the current Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  WARN  Act  which became law in 1988  to better protect workers       While notice of a layoff is no substitute for a job  the WARN Act was supposed to give employees time to find a new job and for help to be provided     said Senator Brown  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee     Under current law  fair notice has proven to be the exception  not the rule  Employers have laid off workers in phases to avoid threshold level  used subsidiaries to evade liability  and pressured workers to sign documents to waive their rights  This needs to change now          For too long  employers have failed to notify workers that they   re about to lose their jobs due to mass layoffs or plant closings even though notice is required by the WARN Act     said Senator Obama     This bill will transform the WARN Act from a symbol into an enforceable law   The least employers can do when they   re anticipating layoffs is to let workers know they   re going to be out of a job and a pay check with enough time to plan for their future          Congress passed the WARN Act two decades ago to protect workers and their families from the harmful effects of sudden plant closings and mass layoffs   While the Act was designed to give workers the opportunity to adjust to the imminent loss of employment  it has become clear that the Act is not achieving that goal   The FOREWARN Act is much needed legislation that will update and modernize the law to better reflect the needs of U S  workers in a 21st century economy and ensure that workers receive the fair notice that they need and deserve     said Senator Clinton   The WARN Act now provides workers 60 days    notification in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs  Employees entitled to notice under WARN include managers and supervisors  as well as hourly and salaried workers  WARN requires that notice also be given to a union  a local elected official  and the state department of labor   According to estimates by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   24 percent of all layoffs are subject to WARN requirements  Of those layoffs  employers provided notice in approximately one third of these situations   The FOREWARN Act would give the U S  Department of Labor  DOL  and state attorneys general the authority to enforce the WARN Act  and would increase penalties to double back pay plus benefits  In addition  it would reduce the mass layoff figure from 50 to 25  reduce the employer size from 100 to 50 employees  and lower the mass layoff trigger  The lower thresholds would protect employees in many smaller manufacturing firms  It would also lengthen the notification period from 60 to 90 days and require employers to provide written notification to the Department of Labor       Job loss does not just affect a worker or a worker   s family  Job loss devastates entire communities and local economies  It is absolutely critical that in these situations  workers and groups have sufficient notice to begin working to attempt to limit the damage this causes in a community  This legislation will close the loopholes and provide the tools necessary for enforcement of the rules     Senator Brown added
