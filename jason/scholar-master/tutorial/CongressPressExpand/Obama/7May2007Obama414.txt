   Obama  McCaskill Introduce Bill to Evaluate Needs of Returning Service Members   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Introduce Bill to Evaluate Needs of Returning Service Members Wednesday  May  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Would ensure physical and mental health conditions  readjustment priorities are addressed WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  today introduced the Homecoming Enhancement Research and Oversight  HERO  Act  legislation that would launch a comprehensive research endeavor to evaluate the physical  mental health  and readjustment needs of service members returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   Between family commitments  widespread traumatic brain injuries and mental health disorders  and multiple redeployments  today   s service members and their families face a unique set of needs that must be identified and addressed      Caring for our returning service members is one thing we can still get right about this war     said Senator Obama      We must ensure that we give our service members  veterans and their families receive the treatment  care  and assistance they need to rebuild their lives   The challenges do not diminish for many service members when they return home because the legacy of war takes a physical and emotional toll   As we bring this war to a resolution  it   s our duty to honor the commitment of these heroes by meeting their long term needs          Those who have fought this war and felt its effects most personally  our servicemen and women  deserve to have a real researched plan for dealing with the aftermath of their sacrifice  so that the mistakes made by the administration in war planning are not repeated in planning for the readjustment needs of these heroes     Senator McCaskill said      Such a comprehensive research effort proved invaluable for Vietnam veterans but came ten years late  We need to deliver the same level of analysis and planning for today   s veterans right now     After many Vietnam veterans had difficulty readjusting when they returned from war  a national Vietnam veterans study was conducted to evaluate their needs  but it was completed more than a decade after the war ended   This war has been described as a    family war      According to the American Psychological Association  60  of deployed service members have family responsibilities  and at any given time  some 500 000 children have at least one parent deployed   There is a lack of research focused on mental health and other readjustment needs of returning service members  including service connected PTSD and increasingly complex Traumatic Brain Injuries  The Hero Act would direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to launch a national research study which would achieve the following in two phases  Phase One Research  completed in 180 days  Preliminary findings on the mental health and adjustment needs as well as gaps in care facing service members  veterans and their families   Description of research tracks and parameters for Phase Two research  Phase Two Research  completed in 3 years   An assessment of the psychological  social and economic impacts of deployments on service members  veterans and their families  including the particular impacts of multiple extended deployments and the long term effects of untreated physical and mental health disorders  such as PTSD    An assessment of the particular needs and concerns of female members of the Armed Forces and female veterans An assessment of the particular needs and concerns of minority members of the Armed Forces and minority veterans   An assessment of the particular educational and vocational needs of returning service members  veterans and their families   An assessment of the full scope of the effects of TBIs on service members and former members  including effects on the family members and caregivers  and efficacy and accessibility of current treatment options within the DOD and VA   Recommendations  based on Phase Two findings  of remedies or strategies to prevent  minimize or address the impacts  needs and gaps in care identified  Follow Up Action Planning  The VA and DOD must submit joint planning documents  with cost estimates  which respond to the NAS findings  and the GAO will audit these documents  The Hero Act has been endorsed by Veterans for America  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  Coalition to Salute America   s Heroes and the Brain Injury Association of America  Senators Obama and McCaskill also sponsored the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  which takes a comprehensive approach to improving treatment for returning service members  from improving facilities  to increasing caseworkers and counselors and easing the transition from the DoD to the VA   Senator Obama is also the sponsor of the Lane Evans Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act  which would make veterans who served on active duty during a period of war eligible for a mental health evaluation and provide hospital care  medical services  nursing home care  and family and marital counseling for any identified mental health condition
