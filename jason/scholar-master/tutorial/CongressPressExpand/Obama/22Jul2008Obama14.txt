to Provide Access to Voter Registration for Veterans Tuesday  July 22  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                      CONTACT  Scott Gerber  Feinstein  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Legislation would give veterans access to voter registration services at VA facilities    WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and John Kerry  D Mass   today introduced a bill to require the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide voter registration services to veterans in the department s care  The senators introduced the legislation after receiving a response from Veterans Affairs Secretary James B  Peake earlier this month  again denying the senators  request that Secretary Peake designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies  Senators Harry Reid  D NV   Barack Obama  D Ill   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D N Y    Patrick Leahy  D VT   Chuck Schumer  D N Y    Patty Murray  D WA  and Ron Wyden  D OR  are co sponsors   This is about giving those who have fought to spread democracy and freedom the right to exercise that freedom in the voting booth   Senator Feinstein said   I believe the cost of providing voter materials is minimal  And given the sacrifices that these men and woman have made  providing easy access to voter registration services is the very least we can do     It shouldn t have taken a legislative solution to fix a bureaucratic problem  but that s what it s come down to in the name of common sense and patriotism   Senator Kerry said  Making it easier not harder for veterans to vote is the least we can do in our democracy for those who fought for democracy around the globe  The cost of getting these voter materials to veterans is tiny  but its meaning is bigger than any of us     Our nation s service members and veterans have sacrificed so much for our country on the battlefield that we cannot allow them to fight another battle here at home for the benefits and rights they deserve   said Senator Obama    Whether Americans are abroad serving in the Armed Forces  or recovering and living in VA facilities  it is critical that we ensure these brave men and women can exercise their right to vote   It is unacceptable that some veterans in VA facilities are not allowed access to voter registration services   I am proud to join Senators Feinstein and Kerry in their efforts to reverse the VA s current policies  and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and quickly move it forward    We must make it as easy as possible for all people to vote  especially the men and women who have defended that freedom for the rest of us   Senator Reid said    I urge my colleagues to support this important  common sense legislation that provides veterans easy access to the voting process     Voting is a basic right for all Americans  and we should do what we can to remove obstacles to the right to vote  particularly for those who have served this country in uniform   This legislation will help ensure that the men and women who have fought to secure our nation will have their voices heard as part of our democracy   said Senator Clinton   The nation s disabled veterans have given extraordinary service to our country and they deserve our efforts to provide the necessary help to ensure their full participation in our democracy   Senator Leahy said   I hope the Senate quickly passes this important bill  and that the House and the President will act quickly so these steps can be enacted in time for the upcoming national elections    It s always the case that the more participation we have in our elections  the better  But we have a special obligation to ensure our veterans have unfettered access to the polls  This is a simple step that will help our service members exercise the very freedoms they help defend   Senator Schumer said   The right to vote is at the very heart of the democracy that our nation s veterans have fought so hard to protect   Senator Murray said    The VA knows first hand how much our veterans have sacrificed and should make every attempt to make voting easier   not harder   for them   This legislation breaks down barriers to voting for our veterans and helps keep our commitment to protect the rights of those who have fought for us    Our nation s veterans have selflessly answered the call to serve  After being wounded defending our freedoms  many now require care at VA facilities   said Senator Wyden   We should be making it easier for them to exercise their right to vote   not harder  This bill will right that wrong   Specifically  the legislation would   Require the VA to make voter registration services available at VA facilities in states that request it  in accordance with the National Voter Registration Act   These services include providing voter registration forms  answering questions on registration issues and assisting with submitting voter registration forms   Require the VA to assist veterans at facilities to receive and use absentee ballots if they choose to vote absentee    Allow non partisan groups and election officials to provide voter information and registration information to veterans  Require an annual report to Congress from the Department of Veterans Affairs on progress related to this legislation    The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at all offices that provide public assistance  services to the disabled and at all motor vehicle offices  The Act also allows federal agencies to provide voter registration opportunities   Background Many veterans live at VA facilities and some  especially those who are disabled  find it difficult to travel off campus for services including voter registration  However  a federal appeals court recently ruled that voter registration groups do not have the right to register veterans on the grounds of VA facilities   In light of the court decision  Senators Feinstein and Kerry wrote a letter in March to Veterans Affairs Secretary James B  Peake to find ways to ensure that all veterans have access to voter registration materials and identify the policies they have in place to support voter registration  On April 25  the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a directive that required all VA facilities to develop comprehensive voter registration plans to assist veterans in voting  It also required the VA to publicly post voter registration information for veteran facility inpatients and required that VA facilities provide absentee voter applications if patients cannot leave the facility   In May  the Department of Veterans Affairs withdrew that directive  and issued a new directive that introduced a broad prohibition against organizations conducting voter registration drives at VA facilities  including state and local election officials  In response  the senators wrote a letter to Secretary Peake  saying the new policy could discourage involvement from non partisan groups such as veterans service organizations and the League of Women Voters in helping veterans to vote   Just prior to July 4  Connecticut s Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz attempted to provide voter information and register residents at a West Haven Veterans Affairs facility   Secretary Bysiewicz was denied entry to the VA facility under the VA s directive   Instead she sought to register veterans leaving the facility   One such veteran who was registered to vote by the Secretary was Martin Onieal  92  a World War II veteran   Mr  Onieal told her  There was nobody here to do this last year     Earlier this month  Senators Feinstein and Kerry along with Senator Daniel K  Akaka  D HI  again wrote a letter to Secretary Peake to find ways to ensure that all veterans have access to voter registration materials and identify the policies they have in place to support voter registration   Last week  Secretary Peake wrote back to the senators  denying their request to designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies  The senators today proposed the legislation in the wake of that denial                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of
