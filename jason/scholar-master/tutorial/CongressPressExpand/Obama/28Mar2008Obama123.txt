temporary location until April 19th                                                         Obama Encourages President to Urge Tibet Resolution Friday  March 28  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  calling on him to employ every diplomatic tool to persuade Chinese President Hu Jintao to make significant progress in resolving the Tibet issue   Given the recent events in Tibet and the upcoming Beijing Olympics  Obama asks President Bush to encourage the Chinese government to negotiate with the Dalai Lama  guarantee religious freedoms for the Tibetan people  protect Tibetan culture and language  and support the exercise of genuine autonomy for Tibet   Obama also supports Bush s insistence that foreign press and diplomatic personnel have free access to Lhasa and other Tibetan cities and villages to ensure that repression and human rights violations cannot escape the world s notice       The text of the letter is below   Dear Mr  President  The situation in Tibet is deeply disturbing  and requires that all of us  regardless of party  do what we can to try to influence it for the better   I understand that you discussed the subject on Wednesday with President Hu Jintao  The United States has many issues for which China s cooperation is important  including denuclearization of North Korea  ending Iran s nuclear program  stopping the genocide in Darfur  confronting repression in Burma  and combating global warming  However  it is important that we give high priority to the plight of Tibetans and make clear to President Hu that the way in which China treats all Chinese citizens  including Tibetans  profoundly affects how China is viewed in the United States and throughout the international community  Resolution of differences between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama is the key to progress in Tibet   The Dalai Lama  as you have said  is  a good man    He is revered by virtually all Tibetans  and his absence from his homeland creates an incurable wound in the heart of Tibetan Buddhism   Tibet s unique cultural and religious heritage cannot be preserved if he is demonized and kept at arm s length   He has accepted Beijing s precondition for a solution  namely recognition that Tibet is part of China  and has clearly stated that he is seeking religious  cultural and linguistic protection and autonomy for the Tibetan people  not independence   More recently  he indicated his belief that despite recent events  the Chinese people deserve to host the Olympics this summer    I hope you made clear to President Hu the American view about the importance of the following  a negotiation with the Dalai Lama about his return to Tibet  guarantees of religious freedom for the Tibetan people  protection of Tibetan culture and language  and the exercise of genuine autonomy for Tibet   That is the path to the stability and harmony that the Chinese leaders say they are seeking in Tibet  In addition to your personal intervention with President Hu  there are other steps I hope you will take to highlight our concern   I support your call for the foreign press and diplomatic personnel to have free access to Lhasa and other Tibetan cities and villages to ensure that repression and human rights violations cannot escape the world s notice   Beijing has committed to the International Olympic Committee to allow foreign journalists free access to cover stories throughout China  including Tibet   We should hold them to that commitment   The U S  and our democratic allies and friends should also urge the UN Human Rights Council to send an investigatory team to Tibet   China should be encouraged to allow the International Committee for the Red Cross to visit prisons in Tibet to ensure that detainees are not held under inhumane conditions  tortured  or mistreated    Like you  I want to take steps that increase the chance of a negotiated solution between Beijing and the Dalai Lama  and that have the best chance of improving the lives of ordinary Tibetans   Therefore  I support your effort to aggressively use your relationship with President Hu to achieve these goals   Should it appear  however  that the Chinese are taking private diplomacy as a license for inaction or continued repression  I would urge you to speak out forcefully and publicly to disabuse them of the notion that they can thus escape international censure  Despite the high emotions of the present time  I hope you can persuade the Chinese leadership that in this the year of the Beijing Olympics they have a unique opportunity to make dramatic progress in resolving the Tibet issue   Chinese leaders have it within their power to achieve that worthy goal if they take steps to change the situation in Tibet for the better and by reaching an accommodation with the Dalai Lama  Progress in Tibet would profoundly affect the world s perception of China as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in August  Sincerely    Barack Obama United States Senator
