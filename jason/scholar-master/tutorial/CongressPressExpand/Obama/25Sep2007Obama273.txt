                        Obama Calls On Bush to Release Information on Private Security Contractors in Iraq Monday  September 24  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent President Bush the following letter  calling on him to immediately compile and release information on the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of the contracts  and the number of contractors killed or wounded   With an estimated 48 000 private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following    Last week  Obama filed an amendment to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which requires federal agencies to compile and report information on security contractors to Congress   Obama originally offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President  I am writing to express my concern about the lack of transparency and accountability in the U S  government   s use of private security contractors in Iraq   I was disturbed by recent press accounts describing a firefight in which Blackwater USA security contractors killed at least 9 people and wounded many others   This recent incident  which is under investigation by the Department of State  raises larger questions about the role of private security contractors and the impact their use has on our military efforts in Iraq    Little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following   Moreover  according to press accounts  Blackwater has been exempt from military regulations governing other security companies  such as restrictions on the use of offensive weapons  requirements to report shooting incidents  and compliance with a central tracking system that allows commanders to monitor the movements of security companies on the battlefield   In February  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674    This legislation would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of the contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The bill also would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct committed by contractors     I have offered an amendment that includes several provisions drawn from S  674 to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  and similar provisions have been included in the House version of the bill    With tens of thousands of private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  the U S  government should immediately compile and release this critical information required by my legislation   The American people deserve to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent abroad  whether American civilian contractors are adequately protected  and whether these contractors are abiding by American law  Accordingly  I request that you direct the appropriate federal agencies to compile the following information about private security contracts and provide it to Congress in a timely fashion    1  The number of persons performing private security work in Iraq and Afghanistan under contracts entered into by federal departments and agencies  including the Department of Defense  the Department of State  the Department of the Interior  the United States Agency for International Development  and the elements of the intelligence community  respectively   2  The companies awarded such contracts and subcontracts   3  The total cost of such contracts   4  The total number of persons who have been killed or wounded performing work under such contracts   5  A description of the military equipment and safety equipment provided for the protection of contractors under such contracts  and an assessment of the adequacy of such equipment   6  The policies and procedures through which federal departments and agencies instruct and inform contractors of the applicability of the laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan to their activities   7  The policies and procedures through which federal departments and agencies monitor contractors on their adherence to the laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan   8  The laws  if any  determined to have been broken in the performance of such contracts  including laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan  and  9  A description of the disciplinary actions that have been taken against persons performing work under such contracts by either the contractor concerned or the governments of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan  It is our government   s obligation to ensure that security contractors in Iraq are subject to adequate and transparent oversight and that their actions do not have a negative impact on our military   s efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan   Please let me know by October 1  2007  whether you will agree to provide this information  Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
