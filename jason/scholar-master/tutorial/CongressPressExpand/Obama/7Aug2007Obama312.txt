   Obama Calls on Gates to Reform Weapons Accountability System in Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on Gates to Reform Weapons Accountability System in Iraq Tuesday  August  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT   Obama Press Office  202 228 5566 U S  arms may inadvertently be fueling all sides of Iraq s civil war WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Roberts Gates  requesting recommendations for reforming the process of equipping Iraqi Security Forces   According to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office  the U S  military cannot account for almost thirty percent of the weapons transferred to Iraqi forces in 2007   As a result  the U S  may be inadvertently providing arms to all sides of Iraq s civil war   In the letter  Obama requests a detailed explanation and assessment of the accountability measures and recommendations for reforming the system  The text of the letter is below    Dear Secretary Gates  I am writing to request your recommendations for reforming a system of equipping Iraqi Security Forces that is clearly lacking in accountability  According to a report recently released by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   the U S  military cannot account for nearly 30 percent of the weapons that were given to Iraqi Security Forces through early 2007   Specifically  GAO reports that some 110 000 AK 47 assault rifles and 80 000 pistols are missing   Furthermore  GAO reports that the U S  military had no system of accounting for these weapons in 2004 and 2005  when something as simple as a serial number could have provided an important tracking tool  Given the importance of the train and equip program to the long term prospects for peace and stability in Iraq  I am deeply troubled that this program seems to lack such basic oversight   Because small arms fire is a hallmark of this conflict  it is likely that these weapons are being used against our own brave men and women serving in Iraq   We also may be inadvertently providing arms to all sides of Iraq s civil war   Given the enormous amount of weapons missing  it is all too probable that groups like Sunni Arab insurgents  Shiite militias with ties to the Iranian government  and common criminals have been using weapons that were bought and paid for by the American taxpayer  With this letter  I am requesting a detailed explanation of the accountability measures in place to ensure that our weapons are not falling in the wrong hands  your assessment of those accountability measures  and your recommendations for reforming a system that has clearly been inadequate   For roughly four years we have been trying to train and equip competent Iraqi Security Forces  it is past time that we got this right  Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
