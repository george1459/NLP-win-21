                Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers Monday  August 14  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs   202  228 5511  Date  August 14  2006  Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Monday requested that the FTC investigate what impact BP s closure of the Prudhoe Bay pipelines along the North Slope of Alaska will have on consumers    It is clear that the closure of these pipelines   will have an effect on the economic well being of the State of Alaska and on gas prices for American consumers   Obama said   Nevertheless  last week  the President of BP America would not answer a direct question from a network reporter as to whether or not BP would pass along the costs of its mistakes to customers  despite the company recording profits of  22 6 billion last year     According to news accounts  BP did not anticipate in some cases that 20  and 30 year old pipes would require regular safety inspections using some of the latest available technology  A BP official reportedly admitted that a pipeline in operation since 1977 had never even been tested using an industry standard procedure known as  smart pigging   Had the appropriate tests been conducted  BP would likely have known that some areas of the pipes had corroded to the point of becoming  paper thin   It also appears that BP may have actually scaled back the use of costly but needed corrosion inhibitors in some of its pipelines     The news of this pipeline closure has already further increased record high gas prices for consumers across the country   said Obama   BP shouldn t make things worse by passing the cost of their mistake on to consumers     Below please find the full text of Obama s letter      August 14  2006   The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC  20580   Dear Chairman Majoras    I am writing to request that the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  investigate the impact on consumers of BP s closure of the Prudhoe Bay pipelines along the North Slope of Alaska     The FTC is charged with protecting consumers from negligent business practices that can distort prices and harm consumers   Over the last several years  the FTC has conducted several studies on high oil prices   As recently as May 2006  the FTC issued a report that concluded that oil companies were not manipulating the market or fixing prices in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   A related issue is whether short sighted efforts by companies like BP to cut corners have resulted in unnecessary environmental degradation or unfair price increases to American consumers     According to news accounts  BP did not anticipate in some cases that 20  and 30 year old pipes would require regular safety inspections using some of the latest available technology   Indeed  a BP official reportedly admitted that a pipeline in operation since 1977 had never even been tested using an industry standard procedure known as  smart pigging    Had the appropriate tests been conducted  BP would likely have known that some areas of the pipes had corroded to the point of becoming  paper thin    It also appears that BP may have actually scaled back the use of costly but needed corrosion inhibitors in some of its pipelines    Only after some 267 000 gallons of crude oil spilled on Alaska s North Slope in March 2006 did BP finally take steps to expand its inspection regime and check for possible corrosion   At that point  however  it was too late to do anything but shut down the pipelines and replace the corroded segments   Had BP taken the proper precautions  it might have been able to prevent the environmental damage caused by the leak and last week s untimely shutdown of production     It is clear that the closure of these pipelines   despite the restoration of some production capacity in recent days   will have an effect on the economic well being of the State of Alaska and on gas prices for American consumers   Nevertheless  last week  the President of BP America would not answer a direct question from a network reporter as to whether or not BP would pass along the costs of its mistakes to customers  despite the company recording profits of  22 6 billion last year     I believe that companies like BP have an essential role to play in America s energy future   Large oil companies are too important and receive too many public benefits to shirk their public responsibility   The government must ensure that the appropriate environmental protections and consumer safeguards are in place and that these companies are properly balancing the interests of shareholders and consumers   Indeed  the guarantee that American consumers will be protected from negligent and shortsighted business practices serves as a linchpin to the smooth functioning of our markets     Accordingly  I ask that the FTC investigate the consumer impact caused by BP s disregard for environmental safety and sound business planning   It is important for the FTC to assess the harm done to consumers and determine what if any steps must be taken by BP  other energy companies  regulatory agencies or Congress in order to protect the American consumer from unnecessary disruptions and price increases in the future     Please let me know by August 31  2006  whether you will agree to open such an investigation   Thank you     Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
