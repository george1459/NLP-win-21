   Obama Raises Concerns About Lead Contaminated Toys to Industry Trade Group   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Raises Concerns About Lead Contaminated Toys to Industry Trade Group Thursday  August  9  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Obama Press Office  202 228 5566 Almost 1 million plastic toys were recalled last week WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to the Mr  Carter Keithley  president of the Toy Industry Association  raising concerns about the serious and growing issue of lead contaminated toys   In the letter  Obama requests information on how the trade group and its companies are working to reduce the number of lead contaminated toys  and how American companies are attempting to regulate foreign supply chains   Last week  Obama called on the Senate Commerce Committee to move forward his Lead Free Toys Act of 2007  S  1306   which would protect our children from products containing lead   Obama originally introduced this legislation in November 2005  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  Keithley     I am writing to you about a critical health issue that is endangering the health of too many children in this nation    lead poisoning from children products   It is simply unconscionable that lead contaminated products that pose such a serious and significant danger to children are so prevalent in our department stores and markets   As you know  in 1998 the Toy Industry Association  TIA  pledged that its members would help reduce children s exposure to hazardous lead levels  by going beyond what the law requires and eliminating lead from children s products   This announcement was met with great enthusiasm due to TIA s role as the lead trade association for toy manufacturers  representing about 85 percent of toy sales   Through its partnerships with the federal government  standard development organizations  independent toy safety experts and others  the toy industry has made important progress in developing globally recognized toy safety standards   And yet  despite its efforts  10 years later we know that millions of children products  including candy  jewelry  bibs  drum sets  toy bears  and gardening sets  are still contaminated with lead  Just this week  we learned that Fisher Price  whose parent company is Mattel  is recalling 83 types of toys worldwide because the paint in the toys contains excessive amounts of lead   This worldwide recall involves over 1 million plastic preschool toys  including the popular Big Bird  Elmo  Dora and Diego characters  sold in the United States over the last 3 months   Fortunately  almost two thirds of these toys were able to be quarantined before they hit the store shelves   But we know that this is not always the case just one year ago  a 4 year old child died from lead poisoning after ingesting part of a Reebok bracelet that had a high level of lead  The Fisher Price recall is just the latest in a series of high profile child product warnings or recalls because of lead contamination   In May of this year  for example  Wal Mart Stores Inc  stopped the sale of Baby Connection brand vinyl baby bibs nationwide because these bibs were found to have lead levels that were more than 16 times higher than the legal limit for lead in paint   Incredibly  over 25 recall and safety notices have been issued in the past six months for potentially lead contaminated children s products  and the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  has reported that 20 percent of jewelry poses a potential poisoning hazard  Increased federal regulatory efforts would be an important step in addressing the problem of lead contaminated toys   To that end  I have introduced the Lead Free Toys Act of 2007  which would give the CPSC the authority to ban children s products containing lead   However  toy manufacturers also play a critical role in reducing lead exposure from toys   I am interested in learning about how TIA and its member companies are dealing with this serious problem   Because many of these products are manufactured abroad  I would also like to know how U S  companies are attempting to regulate their foreign supply chains  Thank you in advance for your cooperation  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
