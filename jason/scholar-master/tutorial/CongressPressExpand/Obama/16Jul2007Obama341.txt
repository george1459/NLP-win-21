            Obama Introduces Bill to Reduce Teen Pregnancies in Minority Communities Monday  July 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation would strengthen community based efforts  establish national information database WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007  which would help prevent teen pregnancies in minority communities   This legislation would strengthen community based intervention efforts for teen pregnancy services  establish a comprehensive national database to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive information on teen pregnancy reduction  and support research on teen pregnancy in communities of color   U S  Representative Hilda Solis sponsored this bill in the House  H R  468       Teen pregnancy can derail the plans of students with dreams of achieving professional success  and it   s hitting minority communities particularly hard     said Senator Obama      While the country   s overall teen birth rate continues to decline  pregnancies in African American and Latino communities remain inexcusably high   We must develop innovative approaches to strengthen our community support networks and services to educate our teens about pregnancy and provide them with every chance to succeed in school and beyond      Recently  the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics released a study showing that in 2005  the teen birth rate hit a new low   In 2005  the adolescent birth rate was 21 per 1 000 young women ages 15 17  which represents a decline of more than 40 percent from 1991 to 2005   Yet despite this good news  nearly 750 000 teens will become pregnant this year and approximately 4 million will contract a sexually transmitted infection   According to the Forum study  communities of color continue to be at significantly higher risk for teen pregnancies    The birth rate among 15 17 year old African American and Latina adolescents is 3 times and 4 times higher  respectively  than the rate for white teens   According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  over half of Latina teens and African American girls will get pregnant at least once before age 20   The Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act creates a three pronged approach to reverse these trends   This bill provides grants to public and private non profit entities for community based intervention efforts targeting schools  the family  and the media to promote and strengthen communication and services regarding teen pregnancy   It establishes grants for the creation of a National Clearinghouse to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate information and technical assistance to those seeking to reduce rates of teen pregnancy   Finally  this legislation supports research on teen pregnancy in communities of color    The Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007   Community Based Intervention Programs The main emphasis of the bill is on community based intervention programs to prevent teen pregnancy   This section receives the majority of funding provided by the bill for

Educate community members about the consequences of teen pregnancy  or  Provide medically accurate contraceptive information for sexually active teens  or those at high risk for engaging in sexual activity  and talk about the responsibilities of parenthood   This section would also require HHS to fund its own evaluation of six programs funded by grants in this section   This evaluation would provide currently unavailable crucial information about effective messages for communities of color  and puts the responsibility of evaluation on HHS  which has the resources for such an evaluation  not on an individual grantee with limited funds   The bill authorizes  40 million per year for four years for this section   School Based Projects This section provides grants for public and nonprofit

authorizes  6 million per year for four years for this section     National Clearinghouse for Teen Pregnancy Prevention This section provides grants for a nonprofit entity to establish a National Clearinghouse for Teen Pregnancy Prevention   This Clearinghouse would provide information and assistance to develop content and messages for teens and adults that address teen pregnancy and STI   s
