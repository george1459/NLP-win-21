Monday  July 21  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  DC   After learning of the newest discovery of Emerald Ash Borer in Chicago and McLean County  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today requested assistance from the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  in responding to the infestation   Assistance may include resources for surveillance activities  deploying traps  setting up and enforcing compliance agreements and quarantine areas   We are writing to inform you of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Bloomington  Illinois  and to ask for your assistance in responding to this infestation   wrote the Illinois Senators    With more than 60 miles between discoveries  responding adequately to this infestation will require additional resources   This discovery is particularly troubling given the destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the significant distance between this discovery and the previous southernmost discovery in Peru  Illinois     Last week  Durbin  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  32 5 million for nationwide efforts to combat and prevent the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer  EAB    This funding represents an increase from the   30 7 million in last year s final Agriculture Appropriations bill    Additionally  the bill includes special language directing the US Department of Agriculture s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to work collaboratively with the City of Chicago to manage the infestation and provide appropriate resources   The Emerald Ash Borer  which has now been found in Cook County  DuPage County  Kane County  LaSalle County  McLean County and Will County  is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees  ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  The bug is able to cause significant damage in a limited amount of time   infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years   Timely and concerted management efforts are vital to slow the spread of the infestation  Since it was first discovered in Michigan in 2002  the Emerald Ash Borer has killed more than 30 million trees and has spread to Indiana  Ohio  Maryland  Virginia  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and Illinois  text of letter below July 21  2008   The Honorable Ed Schafer  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture   1400 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20250 Dear Secretary Schafer  We are writing to inform you of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Bloomington  Illinois  and to ask for your assistance in responding to this infestation   The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced this afternoon that the invasive pest was found in McLean County    This discovery is particularly troubling given the destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the significant distance between this discovery and the previous southernmost discovery in Peru  Illinois   With more than 60 miles between discoveries  responding adequately to this infestation will require additional resources   For example  it is likely that surveillance activities will need to be increased around McLean County  requiring additional personnel   If the beetle has spread to areas between Peru and Bloomington  a significant increase in resources will be needed to manage the spread of this pest      As you know  since it was first discovered in Michigan in 2002  the Emerald Ash Borer has killed more than 30 million trees and has spread to Indiana  Ohio  Maryland  Virginia  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and Illinois   The bug is able to cause significant damage in a limited amount of time  which means that timely and concerted management efforts are vital to slow the spread of the infestation    Thankfully  the U S  Department of Agriculture has established a productive partnership with the Illinois Department of Agriculture  and progress has been made in providing resources to the state through a federal state cooperative agreement   In addition  Congress has provided additional resources to USDA s EAB program  which have been used to develop new EAB management techniques and technologies  We ask that you seriously consider the funding needs of the State of Illinois in responding to this discovery   In addition  we invite you to visit Illinois to observe the recent infestation    Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general
