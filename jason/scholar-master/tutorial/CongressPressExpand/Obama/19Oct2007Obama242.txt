   Durbin and Obama Unsatisfied with VA Response   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Durbin and Obama Unsatisfied with VA Response Friday  October 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Christina Mulka  Durbin  WASHINGTON  DC     Unsatisfied with the answers that the Department of Veteran   s Affairs  VA  provided in response to two letters  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today called on the Acting Secretary of the VA  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to new information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center  While asking follow up questions to the response that they received from the VA  the Illinois members expressed their view that any concerns over health care quality at the facility must be immediately addressed  On August 31  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths  Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  The VA   s responses followed two letters that Senators Durbin and Obama sent looking into a spike in deaths at the VA Medical Center in Marion  Illinois  The first letter was sent on September 17 to Secretary Nicholson asking for more information on the ongoing investigation  In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated  The second letter was sent to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  on September 24 asking specific questions about the VA   s response to the increase in deaths at the center  They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  The text of the letter appears below  October 18  2007   The Honorable Gordon Mansfield   Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  U S  Department of Veterans Affairs   810 Vermont Ave   NW   Washington  DC 20420   Dear Secretary Mansfield  Thank you for your response to our offices dated October 12  2007  While we appreciate the timeliness of your reply  the letter raised more questions than it answered  We are therefore writing to request additional answers and clarifications to your responses to our original letters and to ask that you respond to new information that has come to light regarding health care quality and patient safety at the Marion VA Medical Center  VAMC   We respectfully request answers to the following questions  1  How many fatal and non fatal patient safety events have occurred at the Marion VAMC since the beginning of 2006  Specifically  for all surgeries conducted at the Marion VAMC since the beginning of calendar year 2006 through September 2007  please provide figures broken out by quarter and attending physician on the following  a  Actual and expected rates of post operative infection and other  surgical complications  and death   b  Actual and expected average lengths of hospitalization   c  Actual and expected rates of hospital readmission within 30 days  d  Citations from JCAHO and other accreditation and licensing entities  and e  Other relevant indicators of surgical care quality  2  You reported that over the period between April 1 and September 1  2007  there were 36 hospital deaths at the Marion VAMC  To the extent allowable under HIPAA  please elaborate on the reasons for hospitalization  causes of death and how many of these deaths were unexpected  How many of these deaths involved Dr  Veizaga Mendez  3  You provided comparative data that implied that the frequency of deaths between April 1 and September 1  2007  was within normal bounds for the VA  Yet you have previously described there being a    spike    in deaths during this time period  What data or evidence led you to believe there was a spike  4  You reported that  at the time of Dr  Veizaga Mendez    original appointment  VA    made a query of the National Practitioner Data Bank Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank  NPDB HIPDB      Please provide documentation of your query and the information obtained as a result of that query  Was any information returned that would give the VA a reasonable cause for concern in allowing Dr  Veizaga Mendez to care for veterans  5  Please provide any material regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez you received from the Massachusetts Medical Board during the time he was under consideration for employment at the Marion VAMC as well as any materials or notifications received from the Massachusetts Medical Board while he was employed at the Marion VAMC  Specifically  did the information provided by the Massachusetts Medical Board describe two malpractice payments  one each in 2004 and 2005  made by Dr  Veizaga Mendez and a record of the hospital disciplinary action taken against Dr  Veizaga Mendez in 2004  If not  why was that material not made available to the VA since those actions were already final when Marion VAMC allegedly requested information from the Massachusetts Medical Board  6  As part of their credentialing processes  many hospitals require doctors to answer written questions regarding past charges or claims filed  Did the VA pose such questions to Dr  Veizaga Mendez as part of his VA application  and if so  a  What were the specific questions VA asked of Dr  Veizaga Mendez   b  What were Dr  Veizaga Mendez    answers to these questions   c  Does any of the information he provided conflict with known information about charges or claims related to his practice in Massachusetts  In addition  did the VA contact Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s former employers and former hospitals at which he held clinical privileges in Massachusetts  And if so  did any of the information obtained in those instances provide cause for concern regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez  Please provide copies of the five written letters of reference that you obtained  7  In describing the VA   s general approach to conducting background checks on medical hires  you reported that the VA Health Administration    also checks the names of all applicants against a Federal list of individuals who have been excluded from participation in any Federal health care programs     Did the VA perform such a check on Dr  Veizaga Mendez and what were the results  What procedures does the VA have in place to ensure that all VA facilities perform such checks when hiring new health care professionals  Our offices have received at least one new complaint involving a veteran who may have sustained a life altering injury in a VA facility as a direct result of a preventable medical error  Our offices are working closely with the family to ensure this individual gets the help and benefits he deserves  This new case  which we are sharing with the Office of the Inspector General  is all the more troubling because it involved a second physician  and not Dr  Veizaga Mendez  This case     and we are concerned there may be others like it     suggests that the problem with health care quality  particularly patient safety  may be more widespread than previously believed  Underscoring this concern is the account from the veteran   s mother that one health professional at the Marion VAMC went so far as to warn her to take her son elsewhere for care  suggesting that concerns over the quality of health care were well known among at least some of the hospital   s staff  This raises the question as to whether this concern was known by the VA   s leadership  Obviously this case must be reviewed and verified  but we expect that you would agree that  given the situation  this case raises serious concerns that must be addressed  8  Does the VA believe that the problems with patient safety and patient care extend beyond the problems associated with Dr  Veizaga Mendez and the other three Marion staff that have been reassigned  Was the leadership of the VA aware of other allegations of poor patient care and lax patient safety  And what steps has the VA taken to ensure that health care quality and patient safety are at the highest levels at all VA facilities nationwide  We want to underscore our belief that the majority of VA health staff perform their jobs with exceptional competence and compassion on a daily basis  They deserve our praise for their dedication and patriotism  and we know that Marion is proud that its VA facility serves veterans across the region  At the same time  Marion residents share our view that any concerns over health care quality at this VA facility must be immediately addressed  We know that you are committed to investigating and remedying quality and patient safety issues  and to preventing similar occurrences at Marion and other VA health facilities around the country  Thank you for responding to our request by October 26  2007  Sincerely    Richard Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator
