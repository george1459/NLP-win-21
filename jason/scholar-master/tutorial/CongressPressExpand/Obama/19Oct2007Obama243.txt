   Obama  Durbin Demand Security Improvement At Our Nation   s Airports   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Durbin Demand Security Improvement At Our Nation   s Airports Friday  October 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Christina Mulka  Durbin   In tests  60  of fake explosives went undetected through airport security at O Hare WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Richard Durbin  D IL  today called on TSA Administrator Kip Hawley to immediately improve the bomb detection capabilities at Chicago O   Hare International Airport and our nation   s other airports   According to yesterday   s USA Today  a recent report by the TSA revealed that undercover agents posing as passengers carrying materials for fake bombs were able to walk through airport security undetected at alarming rates during tests last year   Two other airports   Los Angeles International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport   joined O   Hare as the testing grounds for detection of bomb materials at passenger security checkpoints   Of the 75 passengers who carried fake explosives through screening stations at O   Hare  nearly 60  passed undetected   These test results are a frightening reality check for travelers about the screening capability of our nation   s airports    In the letter  Obama and Durbin call on Administrator Hawley to provide information as to what steps have been taken to address these recent security deficiencies  what measures have been taken to improve screener training  and how bomb detection equipment will be improved     Since our country was attacked on 9 11  strengthening security at Chicago O   Hare and other airports has been a top homeland security priority     said Senator Obama      Reports that airport security at our country   s busiest airports failed to detect fake explosives prove that TSA should immediately step up security   It   s time for the Bush Administration to guarantee the safety of travelers and the security of our country        I am disappointed in the results of the TSA report and want to see that the proper steps are being taken to correct the screening deficiencies at O   Hare     said Durbin      Passengers facing long lines at the airport should not have the stress of traveling compounded by a concern for their safety   Senator Obama and I are asking the TSA to explain how they plan to improve screening to ensure the safety for the millions of travelers who use O   Hare     The text of the letter is below  The Honorable Kip Hawley  Administrator  Transportation Security Administration  601 South 12th Street  Arlington  VA 22202 4220 Dear Mr  Hawley    We are writing to request quick action to improve the detection of bomb materials at Chicago O   Hare International Airport and our nation   s other airports   Our letter is prompted by the recently released Transportation Security Administration  TSA  report indicating that undercover agents posing as passengers carrying materials for fake bombs were able to walk through airport security undetected at alarming rates during tests last year  According to yesterday   s USA Today  TSA carried out these tests at three of the nation   s busiest airports  including O   Hare International Airport in Chicago   Two other airports   Los Angeles International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport   joined O   Hare as the testing grounds for detection of bomb materials at passenger security checkpoints   Of the 75 passengers who carried fake explosives through screening stations at O   Hare  nearly 60  passed undetected   These passengers were able to slip past security with false detonators and explosive materials by hiding materials under their clothes and in everyday items such as CD cases  briefcase linings  and toiletry kits   These test results are a frightening reality check for travelers about the screening capability of our nation   s airports  Although some progress has been made since 9 11  the threat posed by terrorism is still real and is still evolving   Materials to make bombs can come in all shapes and sizes  can be hidden with common household items  and can be difficult to detect   It is critical that the TSA respond to these new challenges to stay ahead of the threat   In your October 16 testimony before the Senate Commerce  Transportation  and Science Committee  you stated      A lesson from 9 11 is that we must be proactive   we must anticipate threats that continue to grow in sophistication and complexity     Yet  a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report this month noted that although the TSA has recognized the need for better technology to detect such materials  this technology has not been deployed successfully   In its assessment  GAO rated the TSA   s ability to    deploy checkpoint technologies to address vulnerabilities    as    generally not achieved       We believe that the 60  failure rate at O   Hare demonstrates a failure that goes far beyond    generally not achieved       The Department of Transportation conducted similar covert tests in 2002 and found that screeners missed 60  of simulated bombs at that time   It is unacceptable that this number remains unchanged five years later   While we commend the TSA for continuously running these covert quality tests and for acknowledging the deficiencies in technology to detect explosives  these efforts are futile unless real changes are made    We would like prompt answers to the following questions  1          In last year   s tests  what types of deficiencies were identified that led to the poor testing results   What steps have been taken and will be taken to address those deficiencies   2          Were any deficiencies identified that were particular to O   Hare Airport    What steps have been taken and will be taken to address those deficiencies   3          What steps have been taken and will be taken to better train screeners so that they will more effectively detect bomb materials   4          What steps have been taken and will be taken to improve the performance of detection equipment to assist screeners in finding bomb materials   5          What targets have been established for improved performance in future tests    Thank you for your attention to this matter   We would appreciate a response within two weeks  Sincerely  Barack Obama
