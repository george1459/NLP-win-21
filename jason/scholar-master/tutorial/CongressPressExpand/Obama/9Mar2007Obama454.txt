   Growing Momentum Behind Obama  Thompson  Murphy Redeployment Plan   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Growing Momentum Behind Obama  Thompson  Murphy Redeployment Plan Thursday  March  8  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Members of Congress  Including Republicans  Support Iraq War De escalation Act WASHGINTON  DC     The Iraq De escalation plan introduced by Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Representatives Mike Thompson  D CA  and Patrick Murphy  D PA  has gained the support of 62 Members of Congress  including 3 Republicans    This momentum comes as public support continues to grow for an Iraq plan that will hold Iraqis accountable to benchmarks  prevent our troops from refereeing a civil war  and remove combat brigades from Iraq by early 2008       Because of the President   s failed strategy  and despite the valiant efforts of our troops  our military options in Iraq have been exhausted     said Senator Barack Obama      The American people and the new Congressional majority  along with some wise Republicans  agree that we should begin to redeploy our troops from Iraq so that a political solution can be found       Setting a timeline for redeployment is the right thing to do for our troops and our country   said Representative Thompson   This bill provides an achievable strategy for getting our combat troops out as safely and quickly as possible  while also helping the Iraqi government secure and rebuild its country  It s time to focus our resources on getting the Iraqi government and its neighbors to step up and take responsibility for Iraq s future     Our troops have done what s been asked of them  now it s time for the Iraqis to step up and fight for their country   A timeline will show the Iraqis that we will not be there indefinitely and that they need to come off the sidelines   said Representative Murphy    As someone who served in Baghdad with the 82nd Airborne Division  I can tell you that we need a political solution   not to send more American fighting men and women to referee an Iraqi civil war   This is about doing what s right for our country  and this is a tough  yet sensible plan to do just that    The De Escalation Act would    Stops the Escalation  Caps the number of U S  troops in Iraq at the number in Iraq on January 10  2007  This does not affect the funding for our troops in Iraq  This cap has the force of law and could not be lifted without explicit Congressional authorization  De escalates the War with Phased Redeployment  Commences a phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq not later than May 1  2007  with the goal that all combat brigades redeploy from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date consistent with the expectation of the Iraq Study Group  This redeployment will be both substantial and gradual  and will be planned and implemented by military commanders  Makes clear that Congress believes troops should be redeployed to the United States  to Afghanistan  and to other points in the region  A residual U S  presence may remain in Iraq for force protection  training of Iraqi security forces  and pursuit of international terrorists  Enforces Tough Benchmarks for Progress  These 13 benchmarks are based on President Bush s own statements and Administration documents and include   Security  Significant progress toward fulfilling security commitments  including eliminating restrictions on U S  forces  reducing sectarian violence  reducing the size and influence of the militias  and strengthening the Iraqi Army and Police  Political Accommodation  Significant progress toward reaching a political solution  including equitable sharing of oil revenues  revision of de Baathification  provincial elections  even handed provision of government services  and a fair process for a constitutional amendment to achieve national reconciliation  Economic Progress  Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than  10 billion for reconstruction  job creation  and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make up of Iraqi regions  Should these benchmarks be met  the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment  subject to the agreement of Congress   Congressional oversight  Requires the President to submit reports to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government s progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals    Intensified Training  Intensifies training of Iraqi security forces to enable the country to take over security responsibility of the country    Conditions on Economic Assistance  Conditions future economic assistance to the Government of Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks  Allows exceptions for humanitarian  security  and job creation assistance    Regional Diplomacy  Launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative   that includes key nations in the region   to help achieve a political settlement among the Iraqi people  end the civil war in Iraq  and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and regional conflict  Recommends the President should appoint a Special Envoy for Iraq to carry out this diplomacy within 60 days  Mandates that the President submit a plan to prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider regional conflict
