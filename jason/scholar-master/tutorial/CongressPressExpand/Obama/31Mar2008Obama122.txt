March 31  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the visit of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to the United States   I would like to extend my sincere welcome to the Honorable Kevin Rudd  who is making his first trip to the United States as the newly elected Prime Minister of Australia  This is a historic visit during a time of transition for both our nations    Earlier today  I spoke with Prime Minister Rudd  and congratulated him on his election as the first Labor Party prime minister in eleven years  I assured him of my personal commitment to maintaining a strong bilateral relationship between our nations in the years to come  and discussed our common interest in advancing peace and prosperity for the people of the United States  Australia  and the world    The alliance between the United States and Australia is deep and strong  and has stood the test of changing times  Labor Party leader John Curtain  along with President Franklin D  Roosevelt  established the U S  Australia alliance in 1942  Prime Minister Rudd s trip affirms the strategic value of this relationship and the friendship between our people  which has endured across generations and administrations    The U S  Australia alliance is a cornerstone of security and prosperity both in the Asia Pacific region and globally  Our two nations are bound by shared interests  shared values  and a common heritage    bonds that were forged in all major wars the United States was involved in during the 20th Century  a distinction unique to Australia    And  as a new century dawns  we are beginning to write a new and important chapter in the bilateral relationship   Indeed  during his first press conference the day after his election Prime Minister Rudd reiterated his strong commitment to the U S  Australia alliance  a deep commitment to a partnership of equals that I share   Like the United States  Australia is trans Pacific in orientation  and for this reason our perspectives and perceptions about regional and global affairs are often tightly aligned   The United States benefits from an Australia that can act as a regional leader in East Asia  but one with global interests and capabilities as well    The Prime Minister s visit provides an opportunity for the people of America to express our deep appreciation for Australia s contributions in combating al Qaeda   We will never forget that following the attacks on September 11  2001  Australia invoked the ANZUS treaty in support of the United States     Australia has deployed some 1000 troops in Afghanistan to the International Security Assistance Force  as well as about 1500 combat and support troops in Iraq   Prime Minister Rudd has also demonstrated real leadership in tackling the critical global challenge of climate change  Within a few weeks of assuming office  the Prime Minister successfully pushed for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as one of the first official acts of his administration  He personally led Australia s delegation to Bali  Indonesia to participate in international negotiations on a post Kyoto protocol       In Asia  the quality of our alliance and scope of our diplomatic partnership shine brightly  We both face a rapidly evolving security order defined by traditional and non traditional security problems  These include  changing regional power dynamics and rivalries  territorial disputes  resource competition  terrorism  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  failed states  environmental degradation  and pandemic diseases  Managing this complex blend of security challenges requires leveraging both bilateral and multilateral mechanisms    The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  organization  which Australia took the lead in creating in 1989  has advanced economic liberalization and integration throughout the Asia Pacific  Australia s involvement in the East Asia Summit since its inception is a welcome development  The Trilateral Security Dialogue among the United States  Australia and Japan has become an important channel for coordinating policy and combining capabilities in addressing emerging security challenges in the Asia Pacific     As the security order in Asia evolves  Australian participation  leadership  and defense of our common values and interests are critical to building open  inclusive  transparent  and flexible regional structures and arrangements  The new arrangements cannot replace America s bilateral alliances   alliances which are not directed at any one nation  but which have served as the foundation for peace and stability in Asia for nearly half a century   But these new mechanisms  building on our traditional alliances  can help sustain the conditions for Asia s peace and prosperity to continue    Prime Minister Rudd brings special skills and experiences to this new chapter in U S  Australia relations  His progressive domestic policy agenda  innovative and realistic diplomacy  and optimistic vision enrich the already solid base of our bilateral dialogue  reminding us that we can accomplish more when we listen to our friends and allies then when we lecture them     Prime Minister Rudd s visit is an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the U S  Australia alliance and to our broader bilateral relationship  America s foreign policy  national security and economic interests gain greatly from the deep ties with our friends
