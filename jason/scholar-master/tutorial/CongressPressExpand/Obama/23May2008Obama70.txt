   Durbin  Obama  IL Delegation Members Urge President Bush to Provide Federal Assistance to Fifteen Southern Illinois Counties   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Durbin  Obama  IL Delegation Members Urge President Bush to Provide Federal Assistance to Fifteen Southern Illinois Counties Friday  May 23  2008  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Additional damage discovered after original request for assistance was denied WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked President Bush to declare fifteen southern Illinois counties federal disaster areas after severe flooding hit the area in March  The Illinois Senators were joined by Congressmen Jerry Costello  D IL   Tim Johnson  R IL  and John Shimkus  R IL  in their support of Governor Rod Blagojevich s appeal of the President s April 28 denial of a request for federal assistance for the following counties  Alexander  Franklin  Gallatin  Jackson  Jefferson  Johnson  Marion  Massac  Perry  Pulaski  Randolph  Saline  Union  White and Williamson   As a result of the denial of federal assistance  the Illinois Emergency Agency  IEMA  requested a second Preliminary Damage Assessment  PDA  which found additional damage to residences in four of the 15 counties that were included in Blagojevich s original request for Federal assistance   In all  the storm destroyed 64 homes and damaged more than 300 homes    Additional resources are badly needed in communities throughout Illinois that have been stretched to the limit in recent months   said Durbin    I am glad to join with my colleagues in Congress and in supporting Governor Blagojevich s request for federal funding that will allow these communities to fully recover from the storms    Illinoisans affected by the destructive flooding in March deserve federal relief to rebuild as quickly as possible   said Senator Obama   Fifteen counties in my home state endured significant damage  and we must ensure these families and businesses have the resources to recover   I strongly urge the President to reconsider his denial of federal assistance for those who are struggling to rebuild their lives    The federal disaster declaration was originally requested on April 8 as a result of severe flooding that began on March 17   The storm and floodwaters destroyed 39 homes and damaged more than 500 homes and 145 businesses   Further damage to roads  bridges  water control facilities and other public infrastructure have been reported although the full extent cannot be measured until the waters recede and local governments can conduct an initial assessment  If the state s request for federal assistance is approved  communities could apply for Individual Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Assistance   Individual Assistance includes aid to individuals and households which can include cash grants to help with temporary housing  home repairs and replacement  and other disaster related costs   Hazard Mitigation Assistance includes funding for measures designed to reduce future losses to public and private property    Hazard mitigation opportunities are assessed in most situations  Additionally  small business administration loans can be provided under an  SBA disaster assistance  declaration by the SBA Administrator even if the President denies the major disaster declaration and includes three types of loans to qualified homeowners and businesses   home disaster loans to homeowners and renters  business physical disaster loans to business owners and economic injury disaster loans to small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives   A federal disaster declaration includes SBA assistance under the Individual Assistance program at FEMA   text of letter below May 23  2008 The Honorable George W  Bush  The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  We write to support Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich s request for a federal disaster declaration for fifteen counties in southern Illinois as a result of flooding beginning March 17  2008   Governor Blagojevich declared these counties state disaster areas on March 20  2008  Severe storms in late March produced extremely heavy rain and flooding in Alexander  Franklin  Gallatin  Jackson  Jefferson  Johnson  Marion  Massac  Perry  Pulaski  Randolph  Saline  Union  White  and Williamson Counties   As a result of the denial of federal assistance to aid residents in southern Illinois  it was necessary for the Illinois Emergency Agency  IEMA  to request a second Preliminary Damage Assessment  PDA   which was completed on May 21  2008  by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA    This PDA was able to verify the extent of damage to those homes that were inaccessible in April due to standing flood water in three counties since the initial PDA   According to the additional information from the second PDA  the storm s damage assessment has increased   In all  the storm destroyed 64 homes and damaged more than 300 homes  and it continues to present a disaster recovery situation that is beyond the capability of the State and affected local governments   Flood waters have also damaged roads  bridges  water control facilities  and other public infrastructure  which was discovered after the water receded  This is the fourth flood event for Illinois in the last year that has warranted federal disaster assistance   Constant flooding has exhausted the resources of many of the local governments affected by the most recent storms   We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of these fifteen counties can receive federal disaster assistance   The flooded area in the fifteen counties has a population that is 45 percent low income  and federal assistance through the programs administered by FEMA will help them to recover from this devastating flood   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin        United States Senator                                                                      Barack Obama  United States Senator
