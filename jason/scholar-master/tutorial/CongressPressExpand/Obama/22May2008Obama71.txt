                                 Senate Passes Kerry Obama Legislation to Close KBR Tax Loophole  Provide Tax Relief for Troops Thursday  May 22  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Whitney Smith  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C    Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama today announced that the Senate passed the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008  The  HEART Act    The Act would provide tax relief to the men and women in our nation s armed services and others volunteering service on behalf of the United States  including Peace Corps volunteers and AmeriCorps volunteers   and is paid for by the Kerry Obama tax reform that closed the tax loophole that allowed defense contractor KBR to avoid paying its fair share of taxes  The Act passed the House yesterday and now goes to the President for his signature   Kerry and Obama were instrumental in ensuring that the funds that will be used to pay for these benefits came from defense contractors that were not paying their fair share of taxes   In March  they introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 to close the loophole that had allowed KBR to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year  It was discovered that KBR and another defense contractor have avoided paying their fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes    Now thousands of military families in Massachusetts will receive the benefits they deserve and big companies will pay their fair share of taxes rather than leaving hard working Americans with the bill   said Senator Kerry    This important bill will provide much needed tax relief to our brave service members and hold American companies accountable for paying taxes and guaranteeing that employees receive the benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Senator Obama    For the sake of transparency and fairness in our tax system  we cannot allow Federal contractors to set up shell corporations in tax shelters and shirk their responsibility to pay payroll taxes for their American employees   I commend Senator Kerry for his leadership on behalf of America s small businesses  workers  and service members and I call on the President to sign this bill into law   The HEART Act includes several provisions included in legislation introduced by Kerry and Senator Gordon Smith  D Oregon  in January of 2007  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief of 2007 aimed to bolster military families and small businesses that employ reservists    The HEART Act would   Enable active duty military personnel to qualify for economic stimulus payments  The HEART Act would clarify that active military who file a joint tax return would be eligible for the stimulus rebate payment even if the spouse does not have a Social Security number   Make permanent the ability to include combat pay as earned income for purposes of the Earned Income Tax Credit  The earned income tax credit  EITC  is a refundable tax credit for eligible low income workers   Generally   earned income  includes taxable wages  salaries  tips  and other employee compensation   Some low income military families who receive the EITC based on taxable military pay could lose this tax credit if they begin receiving non taxable combat pay and have no other earned income on which to claim the EITC   The HEART Act would extend the provision that allows America s military men and women to count combat pay for the purposes of qualifying for the earned income tax credit   Make permanent and modify qualified mortgage bonds used to finance residences for veterans  To give our nation s brave veterans greater access to homeownership  the HEART Act would permanently extend the provision that allows veterans to qualify for state operated  tax exempt mortgage revenue bond programs  This program provides financing to provide lower income individuals without regard to the general first time home buyer requirement   Modify retirement plan protections for reservists who have given their lives in service or who are disabled while serving our country  The HEART Act would modify the Uniformed Services Employment and Re employment Rights Act to  1  allow the day prior to the date of death to be treated as the date the employee returned to work for purposes of triggering payment of benefits under a qualified plan  and 2  permit an employer to make certain contributions to a qualified pension plan on behalf of an employee who is killed or becomes disabled in combat   Modify treatment of differential wages paid by an employer to an employee who becomes active duty military  In the case of an employee who is called to active duty with the United States uniformed services  some employers voluntarily agree to continue paying the level of compensation that the service member would otherwise have received from the employer during the service member s period of active duty  This  differential pay  is not treated as wages for purposes of the federal income tax withholding rules that apply to an employer s payment of wages  The HEART Act would treat differential wages paid by an employer to an employee who becomes active duty military as wages for withholding and retirement plan purposes   Extend the period for filing tax refund credit claims arising from Department of Veterans Affairs  DVA  disability determinations  Because of the lapse of time between retirement and the determination of  or the onset and determination of  a service connected disability  the HEART ACT would extend the statute of limitations to permit retired military personnel to file claims for refunds one year after the date of the determination of a service connected disability is made   Make permanent the special rules that permit penalty free withdrawals from retirement plans  Generally  there is a ten percent withdrawal tax on early distributions from certain retirement plans   Because reservists called to active duty may need access to amounts that they have contributed to their retirement plans in order to meet their personal financial obligations while serving our country  the HEART Act would extend special rules that permit active duty reservists to make penalty free withdrawals from their retirement plans  and a reservist has two years from the last day of the active duty period to contribute distributions to an IRA   Permit recipients of military death benefit gratuities to roll over the amounts received to tax favored accounts for retirement and education savings  To enable survivors of servicemembers should be able to contribute death benefit proceeds to accounts to save for future retirement and education needs  the HEART Act would permit recipients of military death benefit gratuities to roll over the amounts received  tax free  to a Roth IRA or an Education Savings Account  and  Provide a tax credit for small employers with respect to differential wage payments to employees who are on active military duty  Many employers voluntarily eliminate any pay gap between the reservists  civilian pay and military pay by paying the difference  The proposal would treat the pay gap as wages requiring information reporting and subject the differential pay payments to withholding  The proposal would also make it easier for employers to contribute to their activated employee s retirement plans    The HEART Act would also permanently allow the Social Security Administration to disclose tax return information to the DVA for purposes of determining eligibility for certain veteran s programs  clarify that certain tax rebates and benefits are excludible from income for volunteer firefighters  clarify the application of the  five year requirement  to the sale of a principal residence by a Peace Corps volunteer  clarify that state payments to service members are treated as qualified military benefits  and provide for permanent exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence by certain employees of the intelligence community  Supplemental Social Security Income To ensure fairer treatment of military families who depend on Supplemental Security Income payments  the HEART Act would   Allow most military cash allowances beyond basic pay to be treated as earned income for purposes of determining Supplemental Security Income  SSI  eligibility and benefit amounts for military families  and treat certain housing payments as in kind support and maintenance   Disregard state annuity payments paid to blind  disabled  and aged veterans when determining SSI eligibility and benefits  and  Disregard allowances paid to all Americorps volunteers for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility and benefit amounts   Revenue Provisions  The HEART ACT would  revise tax rules on expatriation  American citizens and long term U S  residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income  Under current law  taxpayers can avoid taxes by renouncing their citizenship or terminating their residence  The Heart Act would tighten current law rules to ensure that certain high net worth taxpayers cannot renounce their citizenship or terminate their residence in order to avoid U S  taxes  Under this provision  high net worth individuals would be treated as if they sold all of their property for its fair market value on the day before such individual expatriates or their residency would be terminated  The gain would be recognized to the extent that the aggregate gain recognized exceeds  600 000  which will be adjusted for cost of living in the future    Modify treatment of certain foreign persons performing services under contract with United States  The Heart Act generally would treat foreign subsidiaries of American companies performing services under a U S  government contract as American employers for employment tax purposes  The domestic parent would be jointly liable for employment taxes imposed on the foreign subsidiary   Increase general failure to file return penalty  The Heart Act would increase the general penalty for failure to file tax returns to the lesser of  135 or 100 percent of the amount required to be shown on such return    Mental Health Parity  The HEART Act would extend current law excise tax for failure to comply with the mental health parity requirements for benefits for services furnished on or after the date of enactment through December 31  2008  Current law requires certain group health plans to provide the same coverage for mental health benefits that they provide for medical and surgical health benefits   The HEART Act would extend the imposition of a  100 per day excise tax on group health plans that fail to comply with this requirement
