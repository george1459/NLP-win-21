                           Obama Calls on the SBA to Fairly Consider Government Contracts to Women Owned Businesses Thursday  May  1  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 In 2000  Congress passed a provision requiring the SBA to award 5  of contracts to women owned businesses WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to the head of the Small Business Administration  SBA   Steven Preston  objecting to the SBA s proposed rule  entitled Women Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance procedures  which would do little or nothing to rectify the underrepresentation of and discrimination against women owned businesses in government contracting awards    For decades  evidence has shown that women and minority business owners have been subject to discrimination through lending  access to capital  and basic access to federal contracting opportunities   In 2000  Congress passed legislation to move towards rectifying this problem by aiming to award 5  of federal contracts to women owned businesses   However  this goal has never been met as a result of the SBA s refusal for seven years to take the necessary steps to implement the legislation  and it is unlikely to be met with these unnecessarily stringent proposed regulations  In the letter  Obama calls on the SBA to withdraw its proposal and replace it with a program that reflects the appropriate legal standard  Congressional intent  and the pervasive lack of federal contracting opportunities for women owned small businesses   The text of the letter is below  Dear Administrator Preston   As a member of the United States Senate  I write to convey my strong objection to the SBA s Proposed Rule entitled Women Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance procedures  published December 27  2007  Fed  Reg  73285    I join Senate Small Business Committee Chairman John Kerry who expressed his concerns to you in a recent letter as well  The proposal conflicts with the intent of Congress  is unjustified by any legal standard  and will do little or nothing to rectify the underrepresentation of  and discrimination and artificial barriers faced by  women owned businesses in government contracting awards  As decades of evidence has shown  women business owners and minority business owners have been subject to discrimination in numerous ways  including in lending  access to capital  and basic access to federal contracting opportunities   Based on the record  in 2000  Congress passed an unambiguous law that sought to take a small step toward rectifying this chronic problem faced by women owned businesses   The legislation set a realistic and modest goal that 5  of federal contracts be awarded to women owned businesses   Because of persistent barriers  this goal has never been met   In 2006  women owned businesses comprised 30 percent of all small businesses but received only 3 4  of all federal contracts    There is thus a critical need to implement the Women s Procurement Program in ways that will ensure that Congress s purposes will fully be met   The SBA proposal is not only inadequate to meet this goal  in fact it affirmatively undermines Congress s intent that women owned businesses be awarded their fair share of government contracts    First  the SBA proposed regulations impose legal requirements that go far beyond any legal standard  statutory or constitutional   These requirements create a hurdle for federal agencies which will ensure that Congress s permissible and critical goals will never be met    Moreover  the SBA has unnecessarily and unfairly restricted application of the Women s Procurement Program   Congress exceeded constitutional requirements in directing that the Program be used only in the specific industries where women owned businesses are under represented   But in interpreting the study it commissioned  the SBA limited the Program to only 4 of 2 300 business categories  in fact  the study should fairly be read to find under representation in the overwhelming majority of business categories    Despite a clear and legally justified Congressional mandate  the SBA refused to release the necessary implementing regulations for seven years   Unfortunately  this long awaited proposal is a tragic step backward   The SBA should withdraw this proposal and replace it with a program that reflects the appropriate legal standard  Congressional intent  and the pervasive lack of federal contracting opportunities for women owned small businesses     Sincerely    Barack Obama United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other
