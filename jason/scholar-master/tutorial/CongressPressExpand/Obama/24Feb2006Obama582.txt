   Sen  Obama and Sen  McCain Exchange Letters on Ethics Reform   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Sen  Obama and Sen  McCain Exchange Letters on Ethics Reform Monday  February  6  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Tommy Vietor   February 2  2006   The Honorable John McCain  United States Senate  241 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510   Dear John    Thank you for inviting me to participate in the meeting yesterday to discuss lobbying and ethics reform proposals currently before the Senate   I appreciate your willingness to reach out to me and several other Senate Democrats to discuss what should be done to restore public confidence in the way that Congress conducts its business   The discussion clearly underscored the difficult challenge facing Congress    You and many in the Democratic Caucus have played a major role in reform efforts in the Senate   In fact  the Indian Affairs Committee hearings you led were instrumental in promoting public awareness of the culture of corruption that has permeated the nation s capital    As you know  Senator Harry Reid and others in the Democratic Caucus have taken an important step by introducing   which imposes many of the same disclosure requirements for lobbyists that you have proposed  while also strengthening enforcement  eliminating  pay to play  schemes  and imposing more restrictive rules on meals  gifts  and travel that Members and their staff can receive from special interests that advocate before Congress   This bill  which now has the support of 40 members of the Democratic Caucus  represents a significant step in addressing many of the worst aspects of corruption that have come to light as a result of the Justice Department investigation of Jack Abramoff    I know you have expressed an interest in creating a task force to further study and discuss these matters  but I and others in the Democratic Caucus believe the more effective and timely course is to allow the committees of jurisdiction to roll up their sleeves and get to work on writing ethics and lobbying reform legislation that a majority of the Senate can support   Committee consideration of these matters through the normal course will ensure that these issues are discussed in a public forum and that those within Congress  as well as those on the outside  can express their views  ensuring a thorough review of this matter    Given the state of affairs in Washington  we have a historic opportunity to make fundamental changes in the way our government operates so that the actions we take as public officials are responsive and transparent to the American people   Thank you again for your interest in this important matter    Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator  February 6  2006   The Honorable Barack Obama  United States Senate  SH 713  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Senator Obama  I would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere   When you approached me and insisted that despite your leadership s preference to use the issue to gain a political advantage in the 2006 elections  you were personally committed to achieving a result that would reflect credit on the entire Senate and offer the country a better example of political leadership  I concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable   Thank you for disabusing me of such notions with your letter to me dated February 2  2006  which explained your decision to withdraw from our bipartisan discussions   I m embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble   Again  sorry for the confusion  but please be assured I won t make the same mistake again    As you know  the Majority Leader has asked Chairman Collins to hold hearings and mark up a bill for floor consideration in early March   I fully support such timely action and I am confident that  together with Senator Lieberman  the Committee on Governmental Affairs will report out a meaningful  bipartisan bill       You commented in your letter about my  interest in creating a task force to further study  this issue  as if to suggest I support delaying the consideration of much needed reforms rather than allowing the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings on the matter   Nothing could be further from the truth   The timely findings of a bipartisan working group could be very helpful to the committee in formulating legislation that will be reported to the full Senate   Since you are new to the Senate  you may not be aware of the fact that I have always supported fully the regular committee and legislative process in the Senate  and routinely urge Committee Chairmen to hold hearings on important issues   In fact  I urged Senator Collins to schedule a hearing upon the Senate s return in January    Furthermore  I have consistently maintained that any lobbying reform proposal be bipartisan   The bill Senators Joe Lieberman and Bill Nelson and I have introduced is evidence of that commitment as is my insistence that members of both parties be included in meetings to develop the legislation that will ultimately be considered on the Senate floor   As I explained in a recent letter to Senator Reid  and have publicly said many times  the American people do not see this as just a Republican problem or just a Democratic problem   They see it as yet another run of the mill Washington scandal  and they expect it will generate just another round of partisan gamesmanship and posturing   Senator Lieberman and I  and many other members of this body  hope to exceed the public s low expectations   We view this as an opportunity to bring transparency and accountability to the Congress  and  most importantly  to show the public that both parties will work together to address our failings     As I noted  I initially believed you shared that goal   But I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party s effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman Senator  and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness   Again  I have been around long enough to appreciate that in politics the public interest isn t always a priority for every one of us   Good luck to you  Senator    Sincerely    John McCain  United States Senate    February 6  2006   The Honorable John McCain  United States Senate  241 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510   Dear John    During my short time in the U S  Senate  one of the aspects about this institution that I have come to value most is the collegiality and the willingness to put aside partisan differences to work on issues that help the American people   It was in this spirit that I approached you to work on ethics reform  and it was in this spirit that I agreed to attend your bipartisan meeting last week   I appreciated then   and still do appreciate   your willingness to reach out to me and several other Democrats    For this reason  I am puzzled by your response to my recent letter   Last Wednesday morning  you called to invite me to your meeting that afternoon   I changed my schedule so I could attend the meeting   Afterwards  you thanked me several times for attending the meeting  and we left pledging to work together    As you will recall  I told everyone present at the meeting that my caucus insisted that the consideration of any ethics reform proposal go through the regular committee process   You didn t indicate any opposition to this position at the time  and I wrote the letter to reiterate this point  as well as the fact that I thought     I confess that I have no idea what has prompted your response   But let me assure you that I am not interested in typical partisan rhetoric or posturing   The fact that you have now questioned my sincerity and my desire to put aside politics for the public interest is regrettable but does not in any way diminish my deep respect for you nor my willingness to find a bipartisan solution to this problem       Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic
