                                 Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005 Wednesday  January 25  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  January 25  2006  Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  denied health care to 8 944 Illinois veterans last year as part of a Bush Administration cost cutting policy begun in 2003  Nationally  more than 260 000 veterans were denied access to VA hospitals  clinics and medications in Fiscal Year 2005    The VA denied nearly 9 000 veterans in Illinois health care services they earned last year  This is an offensive and misguided way to balance the budget on veterans  backs   Obama said   These are vulnerable veterans  In Illinois  veterans making an average minimum of  36 600 who went to the VA looking for care were turned away     Since January 17  2003  the VA has refused to admit moderate income veterans who do not have a service connected disability  The 2003 cost cutting measure came after persistent underfunding of the VA budget  In 2005  the VA faced a  1 3 billion shortfall  even after turning away more than a quarter million veterans     Congressman Lane Evans  D 17   the Ranking Democratic Member of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee also criticized the VA policy    There is no reason for the VA to give the cold shoulder to veterans who have served our country honorably   said Evans   The problem is not that veterans are seeking health care from the VA  the problem is that the Administration would rather bar the doors and ration care than put forth an adequate budget to cover the needs of veterans     Senator Obama  a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee has consistently fought for additional VA funding  On June 23  2005  VA announced a budget shortfall of  1 3 billion from its FY2005 enacted level for veteran s health programs  On March 26  2005  Senator Obama voted to add an additional  2 85 billion to the VA health care budget  but the amendment was defeated  An amendment providing  1 5 billion in emergency funding was later signed into law    Later this week  Senators Obama  Akaka and other members of the Veterans Affairs Committee will send a letter to President Bush pressuring him to increase funding for VA health care in his 2007 budget request to be announced on February 6th    The VA s income cutoff varies by county  In Illinois  this averages  36 600 and ranges from a low of  27 350 in 36 rural and low income counties to  40 250 in the Chicago area  The 2005 national average for a single veteran was  25 842  A county by county list of income thresholds is pasted below    Since 2003  a total of nearly a half million veterans were turned away from VA care     Senator Obama Wednesday also praised  Veterans Care   a state level effort announced by Governor Rod Blagojevich last week to extend health coverage to veterans who do not have health insurance and who do not live within a reasonable driving distance of a VA hospital   Where the federal government is failing our heroes  the State of Illinois is filling the gap   Senator Obama said    Below
