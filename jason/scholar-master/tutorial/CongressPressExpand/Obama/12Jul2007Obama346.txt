   Obama  Bond  Boxer  McCaskill  Murray  Lieberman Introduce Amendment to Temporarily Cease Military Personality Disorder Discharges   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Bond  Boxer  McCaskill  Murray  Lieberman Introduce Amendment to Temporarily Cease Military Personality Disorder Discharges Thursday  July 12  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation calls for moratorium until comprehensive review of personality disorder discharge procedures WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Christopher Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Patty Murray  D WA  today introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and an establishment of an independent discharge review board   Recent reports suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately and inconsistently used personality disorder discharges to swiftly discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs     Such discharges can result in the loss of needed healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt     Given the thousands of American service members currently suffering from service connected psychological injuries  reports that the Department of Defense may be improperly diagnosing service members with personality disorders are deeply troubling     said Senator Obama      Given the lasting consequences of a personality disorder discharge  even one misdiagnosis is one too many   This amendment will force the Department of Defense to suspend its use of this discharge procedure until Secretary Gates can conduct a comprehensive review of these policies and establish a review board to ensure our service members have recourse when their cases are in doubt   It is our moral obligation to ensure that our service members receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve   That   s one thing about this war we can still get right         Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This amendment will put a stop to these discharges until we can fix the system     said Senator Bond      The men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom have earned a debt of gratitude from all Americans that we will never be able to pay in full   The very least we can do is take care of their battle wounds  whether physical or mental  and ensure they receive the treatment and benefits they deserve     Senator Boxer said   It is unconscionable that some of our brave servicemen and women  including those suffering from PTSD and other mental health problems  may be receiving improper discharges for personality disorders and  in turn  denied disability benefits and guaranteed care from the Department of Veterans Affairs   This amendment halts these discharges until measures are put in place to ensure they are handled properly   We owe our brave service men and women nothing less      We have no greater obligation to those who serve our country in the Armed Services than to ensure they get the care they   ve been promised     McCaskill said     We cannot stand tall and proud as Americans if we allow one single service member to go without the benefits they deserve due to a misdiagnosis  Far too many combat troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are returning with mental health injuries that bear the potential for misdiagnosis  and we need to do all we can to prevent that from occurring        We need to take a    time out    on these discharges and get the facts  We need ensure these discharges are medically accurate and that service members are not being denied the treatment or benefits they deserve     Senator Murray said  This amendment mandates a temporary moratorium on personality disorder discharges until the Department of Defense conducts a proper review and revision of its current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis   It also gives the DOD flexibility by granting an exception to the moratorium in those cases in which a service member provides false or misleading information  or omits information about past criminal behavior during the recruitment or enlistment process   The moratorium would be lifted after the DOD reviews its current policies  ensures it is following standard clinical diagnostic practices  and has established an independent review board to ensure that service members who have received this diagnosis may seek a review  On June 21  2007  Senators Bond  Boxer  Obama  Lieberman  McCaskill  Murray  and twenty five other Democratic and Republican senators wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly  Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time
