   Obama Demands VA Investigate Allegations of PTSD Misdiagnoses to Reduce Costs   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Demands VA Investigate Allegations of PTSD Misdiagnoses to Reduce Costs Friday  May 16  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake  calling on him to investigate reports that a psychologist at a Texas Veterans Affairs  VA  facility told staff members to refrain from diagnosing veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  in order to reduce costs   According to today s Washington Post  the psychologist  Ms  Norma Perez  apparently emailed Teague Center staff members suggesting the alternative diagnosis to limit the number of tests required to diagnose PTSD   Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began  thousands of service members have returned home suffering from combat related psychological injuries like PTSD  which require much needed treatment    In the letter  Obama calls on Peake to launch an investigation into the incident to evaluate whether Perez was advised to send this e mail or give this instruction at the urging of her superiors  whether staff members at the Teague Center followed Perez s advice  and if so  how many veterans were affected by incorrect diagnoses  whether officials at other veterans centers have given some similar admonitions to staff members charged with diagnosing PTSD  whether affected veterans have been given immediate re diagnoses and  whether this is an incident or a trend through the VA system    Obama also wrote today to Veterans Affairs  Committee Chairman Daniel Akaka requesting a hearing to examine this matter   The text of the letter is below    Dear Secretary Peake    I am writing to express my serious concerns about reports that a psychologist at a Texas Veterans Affairs  VA  facility told staff members to refrain from diagnosing veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD     According to today s Washington Post  Norma Perez  a psychologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs  Olin E  Teague Veterans  Center in Temple  Texas  sent an email to other staffers saying    Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans  I d like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out    She then suggested the alternative diagnosis of  Adjustment Disorder   adding that VA staff members  really don t       have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine PTSD     Simply put  Ms  Perez s email is outrageous    As you well know  PTSD is the most prevalent mental disorder afflicting our returning Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  veterans   In order to receive their deserved benefits  these brave men and women must endure a long and arduous process   To hear that a VA official is promoting misdiagnoses of soldiers to save money is unacceptable and is tantamount to fraud    You have said that Ms  Perez s email is  inappropriate   but more must be done   I call on the Department to open an investigation into the following                1  Whether Ms  Perez was advised to send this e mail or give this instruction at the urging of her superiors at the Teague Center                2  Whether staff members at the Teague Center followed Ms  Perez s advice  and if so  how many veterans were affected by incorrect diagnoses                 3  Whether officials at other veterans centers have given some similar admonitions to staff members charged with diagnosing PTSD    4  Whether this is an incident or a trend   I understand that the VA keeps detailed information on the number of diagnoses of PTSD and adjustment disorder  Your investigation must look at changes in the number of both diagnoses over time  both system wide and on a facility by facility basis     5  What is being done to ensure that any veterans affected by this instruction do not fall through the cracks  All veterans given an incorrect diagnosis should be given redress both in their diagnoses and their subsequent disability benefits     6  Whether there are any trends among veterans who have committed suicide recently to determine whether any were wrongly diagnosed with adjustment disorder   Your investigation should include a survey of root cause analyses of recent veteran suicides      7  Whether there are other instances across the VA bureaucracy of veterans with legitimate cases of PTSD being swept under the rug for budgetary reasons or for expediency   Why  for instance is the number of approved benefits claims for PTSD at the Veterans Benefits Administration decreasing at a time when diagnoses for PTSD at the Veterans Health Administration are increasing     Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy with the singular goal of denying services and benefits to veterans  This recent incident merely serves to promote that impression  I request that you advise me by no later than Friday  May 23  2008  as to whether you will open such investigation      Thank you     Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                               Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or
