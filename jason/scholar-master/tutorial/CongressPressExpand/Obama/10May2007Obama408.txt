   Durbin  Murray  Obama Introduce Bill to Update Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury for Military   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Durbin  Murray  Obama Introduce Bill to Update Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury for Military Thursday  May 10  2007   WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation  yesterday evening  to improve the care of veterans and service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries  TBI    The bipartisan Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act would establish a program within the Departments of Defense  DOD  and Veteran Affairs  VA  that would provide individualized services  improve coordination between the two agencies  require routine brain injury screening tests for military personnel  increase TBI patient benefits  improve case oversight and expand TBI research in the Defense Department and the VA      Too many of our brave service men and women are coming home from war with serious injuries that may be overlooked because they don   t bear any visible wounds or scars     Durbin said     We owe them the best treatment and support  while learning more about these injuries and their treatment   With that knowledge  we can moderate the impact TBI has on the lives of our veterans and their families       Last year  Senator Durbin introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that allocated an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007  That authorization was included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill this January  at Senator Durbin   s urging  That amendment as well as this bill has been endorsed by Veterans for America    Joining Durbin as cosponsors of the bill are Senators John Warner  R VA   Patty Murray  D WA   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Barack Obama  D IL   James Webb  D VA  and Maria Cantwell  D WA    Senator Patty Murray  D WA   an original cosponsor of the bill said    TBI has clearly emerged as the signature injury of the War in Iraq  Unfortunately  the response to treating and understanding it has lagged  leaving our veterans and their families searching for answers  This bill makes TBI research  benefits  and coordination top priorities at the DOD and VA  It also requires routine screening   a critical step toward ensuring that service members with TBI don   t slip through the cracks          Troubling recent reports have made clear that a high percentage of service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from mental health problems and traumatic brain injuries  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling through the cracks     said Senator Obama      As we prepare our nation to assist the generation of service members returning home from war  we must implement comprehensive reforms that provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those with traumatic brain injuries   Providing the best treatment for our service members is one thing about this war we can still get right     Durbin   s bill addresses the following issues  Standard of Care   The act will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Program  run by DOD and the VA  to provide treatment and rehabilitation to service members and veterans who have suffered a service connected traumatic brain injury   It will provide a clear standard ensuring that every service member and veteran suffering a traumatic brain injury will receive the services that best meet their individual needs   Screening   DOD will be required to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre test to be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and upon return from deployment to determine if possible brain injury exists   The act will also require DOD and the VA to conduct outreach to advise service members and veterans about the TBI Program  their rights and responsibilities  treatment and rehabilitation options and the availability of screening   Case Management and Health Care Services   Inefficiencies in case management as well as the complex nature of care required by TBI patients has led to patient and family confusion  contradictory guidance and treatment  and a number of instances in which patients did not receive proper care   This act directs DOD and the VA to assign each patient a lead case manager to ease the stress on patient and family  facilitate navigation through the DoD and VA systems  ensure adequate care is being provided  prevent duplication of efforts  and avoid contradictory guidance   Additionally  DOD and the VA must assign each patient a lead primary care physician to coordinate and oversee the care provided to the participant  including all treatment  rehabilitation  and medications   Overlap of Benefits   To ensure members receive the best care and rehabilitation available  all participants enrolled in the program shall  for the first two years  receive any of the benefits available to veterans and to active duty members  regardless of their active duty status   Patients    Rights     DOD and the VA must also make available an appeals process to challenge any failure to provide the standard of care required in the TBI Program  They must also provide a referral to a medical professional outside of the DOD and VA when requested by a TBI patient   Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war  The widespread use of improvised explosive devices  IED   s  has created thousands of TBI victims  sometimes with no other visible signs of injury  The concussions from IED explosion cause sudden  violent head movements which often lead to a TBI  With symptoms similar to that of shaken baby syndrome  TBI   s are difficult to diagnose  Injured service members may suffer from headaches  confusion  dizziness and lightheadedness in mild cases  to mood changes  loss of memory  convulsions  weakness or numbness in the extremities  and loss of coordination in more severe cases
