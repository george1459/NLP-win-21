   Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons Wednesday  July 19  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511 Date  July 19  2006  Bipartisan Coalition of Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons  13 1 Million Barrels of Oil  by 2028 Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in 20 Years   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil    The true danger of America s dependence on foreign oil is best explained not by politicians or energy experts here in the United States  but by our enemies abroad   said Obama     Oil  is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community   These are the words of Al Qaeda   Focus your operations on oil  especially in Iraq and the Gulf area  since this will cause them to die off  on their own    These are the words of Osama bin Laden  It is clear that the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on earth is the oil we import and cannot live without      Most of the world s oil is concentrated in places that are either hostile to American interests or vulnerable to political upheaval and terrorism   said Lugar  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   To the extent that we remain reliant on imported oil  we imperil our nation s economic health and our way of life      If it was not clear before  it is now  Domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Joseph R  Biden   For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks       Gas prices are skyrocketing but they re just the part of our problem   said Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR    Importing so much oil leaves us vulnerable to some of the most unstable regimes in the world  Automakers have been too slow to change and we re risking damage to American security and the economy       The U S  passenger fleet alone accounts for 1 10th of world oil consumption   said Bingaman   With oil and gasoline prices where they are today  it s hard to imagine a genuine discussion of our country s energy future without a significant effort to improve vehicle fuel efficiency  This moderate proposal to begin raising the standards for fuel economy deserves a serious look from the Senate  There are many good ideas out there and a healthy debate to be had about the best ways to do this  I hope the introduction of this bipartisan bill can spur the Senate to have this long overdue discussion      This sound approach to reducing gasoline consumption will help ensure our vehicles utilize improved technology to stretch how far Americans can drive on a tank of gas   said Harkin   Our dependence on foreign oil not only hurts the budgets of American families  it threatens our economy and national security      Our reliance on foreign oil is not only an economic strain  but also a threat to our national security   said Coleman   It s time we take the decisions about our energy supply out of the hands of foreign nations  By coupling a sensible fuel efficiency standard that will push technology to the marketplace with strong tax incentives  we can put American in the fast lane to energy independence     For years now  automobile manufacturers have built bigger and less efficient vehicles  leaving consumers with poor choices in terms of fuel economy  Automakers have the technology to make SUVs and other vehicles get better gas mileage  but they have chosen not to do that    instead the largest SUVs have gotten bigger  heavier and more dangerous   said Durbin   It s time we fix the law and encourage both manufacturers and consumers to make smart choices for the future     America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  With oil prices hovering near  75 a barrel and total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 1 mile per gallon each year  The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved    This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised    In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year    If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028    The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars    We need to act now if we want to prevent an even greater energy crisis in the future   said Obama   This bipartisan  common sense approach will finally harness the technology we already have to save Americans money at the pump and save America from a dependence on the world s most unstable  undemocratic regimes     The Fuel Economy Reform Act A New Approach to Increasing CAFE Standards   On Wednesday  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   and Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced the Fuel Economy Reform Act to break the legislative and administrative logjam that has prevented fuel economy standards from being raised for more than 20 years   A New Approach  The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 seeks to break the logjam on establishing greater vehicle fuel economy by establishing a target  rather than a mandate  of a 4 percent annualized increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards   a rate that the National Academy of Sciences has determined is possible   unless the experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is technologically unachievable  cannot maintain overall fleet safety  or is not cost effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   Higher Fuel Economy Standards  If the 4 percent per year target is met for ten years after the continuous provision improvements go into effect  this bill will save 1 3 million barrels of oil per day and 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year   If gasoline is just  2 50 per gallon  consumers will save  50 billion at the pump in 2018 alone  By 2028  Americans will have saved a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline and cut global warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases   Flexibility for Manufacturers  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also provides fairness and flexibility to domestic auto makers by establishing different standards for different types of cars   Currently manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars   This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large vehicles rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   The bill creates further flexibility by giving NHTSA the authority to allow companies to earn credit for improving fuel efficiency beyond the CAFE standard in one type of car  and using those credits to meet goals for other vehicle models   Companies would be able to trade or sell excess credits  improving overall fuel standards in the most efficient way  Because technological advances may affect manufacturers over time  the bill instructs the Energy Department  Environmental Protection Agency  and National Academy of Sciences  to study ways to reform the regulatory structure of this approach in 2016   Incentives for Fuel Efficiency  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced technology vehicles  this legislation provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants   This will strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles   The bill would lift the current 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more Americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles    The Problem    America is Addicted to Foreign Oil  America s 20 million barrel a day habit costs our economy  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually   We use 8 million barrels of oil each day on passenger vehicles   Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue   While oil currently hovers near  75 a barrel and  3 00 a gallon at the pump  over the next 20 years total US petroleum demand will increase 23 percent     CAFE Initial Success Followed by 20 Years of Little Progress  In response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s  Congress enacted CAFE standards  the first ever requirements for gas mileage  Under Congress  direction  the NHTSA raised the average gas mileage of cars and trucks from just over 14 miles per gallon  mpg  in 1976 to 27 5 mpg for cars and 20 7 mpg for trucks by 1985   By enacting these standards  the country saves approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day  making it the most successful energy saving measure ever adopted   Unfortunately  since 1985 the NHTSA has been largely unable to increase standards   The CAFE standard for cars has remained frozen at 27 5 mpg for 20 years   The standard for trucks only increased by 2 mpg to 22 2 mpg for 2007   Over those 20 years  the auto industry has developed numerous innovations  which allowed fuel efficiency standards to rise to 45 miles per gallon in Japan   Congressional Deadlock  Since 1985  Congress has considered numerous bills to increase fuel efficiency  without significant gains in CAFE standards   Recently  there has been a logjam between those who want Congress to mandate specific increases in CAFE standards  and those who want to cede the policy choice to NHTSA  even though the agency has been unable to inability to overcome institutional and political obstacles to increasing CAFE standards
