      Obama Introduces Bill to Strengthen Emergency Medical Care Systems Wednesday  July 25  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt Legislation would better coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007  which would provide funding for programs that would enhance emergency care systems throughout the country   Recent reports indicate that our nation   s emergency medical care system is not yet equipped to take on new challenges we could face in the coming years   Through multi year grants in regions across the U S   this legislation would better coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services  streamline emergency communications and organize medical data and information to better serve the public     Our nation   s emergency departments are overburdened and ill equipped to respond to the public health crises we must be prepared to face     said Senator Obama      This bill will ensure our emergency rooms  medical personnel and response teams have streamlined communications systems  real time data  and other coordination tools   We will face unprecedented challenges in the years to come  and we need to equip our emergency departments to prepare for the unexpected     In 2006  the Institute of Medicine  IOM  published a series of reports titled the Future of Emergency Care   The reports concluded that in many places throughout the nation  emergency medical services  EMS  are highly fragmented  poorly equipped  and insufficiently prepared for day to day operations  let alone major disasters   Furthermore  emergency departments  EDs  are increasingly overburdened   Between 1993 and 2003  the nationwide number of EDs declined by 425 while the number of emergency visits rose by more than 25 percent   from 90 300 000 to almost 114 000 000   ED overcrowding  which can lead to ambulance diversion  flawed coordination between emergency medical services and EDs  poor communication with public health departments  and lack of disaster preparedness are among the areas that need thoughtful improvement    Notably  the American College of Emergency Physicians  ACEP  agreed with the IOM findings  giving emergency care in the U S  a national grade of C    in its 2006    National Report Card on the State of Emergency Medicine      The Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007 Regionalized accountable emergency care systems show substantial promise in addressing the complexity of an efficient EMS response  which must properly manage the coordination of a number of groups  agencies  and individuals involved   from incident recognition to providing specialized care to public education   This legislation would support 4 multi year grants to support demonstration programs aimed at designing  implementing  and evaluating a regionalized  accountable emergency care system   Within a defined region  these systems would be designed to  Coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services  Facilitate access to the emergency medical system  e g   9 1 1 Public Safety Answering Points   Establish a mechanism for ensuring a patient is directed to the proper medical facility  Track hospital resources in real time  e g   bed capacity ambulance diversion   Coordinate standardized data management  for pre hospital  hospital  and inter facility transport  Grant applicants must assure certain criteria are met for the proposed system such as compatibility with applicable State EMS systems  establishment of a designation system for special medical facilities  and inclusion of a patient tracking system   A report will follow the completion of each demonstration program to identify  the impact of the regional  accountable emergency care system  factors contributing to the effectiveness of the system  strategies to ensure long term financial sustainability  policy and legislative requirement for system maintenance  and identified barriers and proposed solutions to those barriers  Support for Emergency Medicine Research  Emergency medicine is uniquely defined by the urgency and location of treatment rather than specific organ systems or conditions   This has proven a challenge for funding in emergency medical research because of the broad scope of clinical disciplines it covers   In 2003  only 0 05 percent of NIH training grants awarded to medical schools went to EDs  compared to 29 percent for internal medicine   This Act establishes support for emergency medical research through various Federal agencies in order to expand and accelerate our understanding of the basic science of emergency medicine and enhancing patient outcomes through improved medical service delivery  This legislation is supported by the American College of Surgeons  the American College of Emergency Physicians  and Advocates for EMS    Senator
