   Obama  Inslee Introduce Bill to Help U S  Automakers Produce Hybrids  Lower Health Care Costs   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Inslee Introduce Bill to Help U S  Automakers Produce Hybrids  Lower Health Care Costs Wednesday  April 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Investments in energy efficient technology could help industry regain competitive edge WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Representative Jay Inslee  D WA  today reintroduced the Health Care for Hybrids Act  legislation that would allow automakers to receive federal assistance to help pay their legacy health care costs if they invest some of their savings in building more fuel efficient automobiles       To fight climate change  we must change the formula by highlighting the shared interests of workers  environmentalists  and industry stakeholders     said Senator Obama      The Health Care for Hybrids Act will reduce our dependence on oil while providing automakers with resources to invest in the future of their industry   Producing energy efficient technology could help the U S  auto industry regain its competitive edge       Hybrid cars are a technology available to us today that can dramatically reduce our nation s addiction to oil and greenhouse gas emissions   said Representative Inslee  a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who test drove a next generation plug in hybrid on Capitol Hill in March    Our bill gives incentives and levels the playing field so that American automakers can lead in green cars and supply these vehicles to the world    The transportation sector accounts for two thirds of United States oil consumption   Wide scale deployment of hybrid and advanced fuel efficient vehicles could slash U S  demand for overseas oil   But  as the demand for fuel efficient cars increases globally  foreign manufacturers are filling the orders by increasing production of hybrid cars  while U S  automakers continue to rely on sales of SUVs and trucks   With record losses  the U S  auto industry cannot afford to make the investments that are required to adapt   The Big 3 automakers rightly argue that their retiree health care costs  expected to be  6 2 billion in 2006  hurt their ability to invest and compete  The Health Care for Hybrids Act would address the unique challenges of the U S  auto industry and reduce our country   s dependence on foreign oil at the same time  This bill would set up a voluntary program in which domestic automakers could choose to receive federal financial assistance to cover 10  of their annual legacy health care costs through 2017   The companies that participate in the program would be required to invest at least 50  of their health care savings into manufacturing fuel efficient cars  such as hybrids and advanced diesel vehicles in the United States  or helping domestic parts suppliers retool their manufacturing plants to produce advanced parts   These investments would help domestic auto manufacturers and parts suppliers meet the growing demand for fuel efficient vehicles   More American hybrid cars also ensure that there is competition in this growing market and would also help keep car prices low
