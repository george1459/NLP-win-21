   Obama Introduces Comprehensive Bill to Strengthen Nation   s Middle Schools   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Introduces Comprehensive Bill to Strengthen Nation   s Middle Schools Friday  October 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Chip Unruh  Reed   or Natalie Luna  Grijalva    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today was joined by Senator Jack Reed  D RI  in introducing the Success in the Middle Act  which would authorize grants to states and school districts to improve low performing middle schools  help raise student achievement  and support our teachers   Representative Ra  l Grijalva  D AZ  has introduced a companion bill in the House   This bill would provide additional federal support to help students successfully complete the middle grades and turn under performing middle schools around     For far too long  our education system has overlooked our nation   s middle schools  and failed to provide them the resources they need for our kids to succeed     said Senator Obama      The middle school experience is vital to success in high school and college  and the lack of attention to middle school on a federal level is reflected in the rising high school dropout rate   Like cities across the country  Chicago has seen only 54  of students graduate from high school by the age of 19   We need to do more to invest in these schools  and this legislation will invest in a new generation of leaders by strengthening our middle schools  teachers  and students   If our country wants to remain competitive in math and science on a global level  we must break down any barriers that are preventing our kids from getting the world class education they deserve        Middle school is a critical time in a student   s educational and social development   It is important to reach at risk students early  before they experience a decline in grades and attendance   Research shows that sixth graders who do not attend school regularly or fail math and English are likely to drop out before graduating from high school     said Senator Reed  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee      This legislation will help reform our nation   s middle schools and provide increased support and training for middle school teachers   By targeting additional resources to these grades we will help our children reach their full potential and successfully transition to high school  college  and the workforce        I am very grateful to Senator Obama for initiating the Middle School Bill in the Senate   Middle Schools have long been a forgotten area in our school system     said Congressman Grijalva      This legislation will reverse this pattern and invest in the most crucial years of the education pipeline to ensure our students succeed     The middle school years are a time when academic achievement for U S  students falls dramatically  Minority and low income students are disproportionately affected by underinvestment in middle schools  International math and science comparisons indicate that students in the U S  do not start out behind students in other countries  but they do lag by the end of the middle grades   Many sixth grade students in urban  high poverty schools might attend school sporadically  might be suspended  or fail classes   Research shows that sixth graders with these indicators can account for 40 50  of eventual high school dropouts  and two thirds of the students who will be moved out of their homes and into the juvenile justice system   Since middle schools are more likely than elementary schools or high schools to be identified for improvement  we must identify and address these problems immediately    The Success in the Middle Act would authorize grants to states and school districts to improve low performing middle schools  States would use research findings and promising practices  and work with community partners  such as universities and non profits  to develop plans to improve middle school student achievement   Schools would use early identification data systems to focus on those students most at risk  and to determine how best to teach and support them  Funds would also be authorized to perform research on effective practices to support student learning  and on effective instruction for the middle grades   Specifically  this Act would  Authorize  1 billion a year to states to provide competitive grants to local school districts to improve low performing schools that contain middle grades  Using research findings and promising practices  states would develop detailed plans to improve middle school student achievement   Comprehensive centers  universities  and non profits  would provide technical assistance to the states in developing these plans   Develop and utilize early identification data systems to identify those students most at risk of subsequently dropping out  and to assist school districts in providing targeted interventions to help all middle grades students succeed  Invest in effective strategies at the state and district level such as providing professional development and coaching to school leaders  and developing and implementing comprehensive  school wide improvement efforts and implementing student supports  Authorize funds to generate and disseminate the results of research to identify and employ effective practices that support student learning and success at the middle level   This legislation is supported by the National Education Association  National Association of Secondary School Principals  National Middle School Association  Alliance for Excellent Education  ACT  College Board  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  International Reading Association  Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development  National Council of
