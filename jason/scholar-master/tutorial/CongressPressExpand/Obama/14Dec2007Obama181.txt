                                       Senators Concerned Service Members Suffering from Mental Illness are Not Receiving Impartial Reviews Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Contact  Natalie Ravitz  Boxer   Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Liz Richardson  Kerry   Case of Lt  Whiteside illustrates the need to review DoD policy Washington  D C    U S  Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Barack Obama   D IL  and John Kerry  D MA  today sent the following letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates    December 14  2007 The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   We are concerned over reports that members of our Armed Forces with underlying mental health conditions are not receiving balanced  fair  and impartial reviews when facing judicial punishment and administrative discharge for engaging in misconduct that could be related to their conditions   We understand and support the necessity of maintaining good order and discipline in the military  At the same time  we are concerned that the decision to prosecute a service member with serious mental health issues may  in some cases  be carried out without appropriate consideration of recommendations made by uniformed mental health providers  As such  we ask you to promptly review guidelines for the administrative handling of such complex cases    On December 2  2007  The Washington Post ran a story entitled    A Soldier   s Officer    that clearly illustrates our concerns  The piece details the ordeal of Army First Lieutenant Elizabeth Whiteside  who according to available reports  served honorably at both Water Reed Army Medical Center  WRAMC  and in Iraq before experiencing severe mental health symptoms and attempting suicide  During her apparent suicide attempt  Lt  Whiteside threatened a number of her fellow service members  and as a result  we understand the Army is currently deciding whether to pursue a court martial against her    What we find particularly troubling about this case is that military commanders with no medical training derided the documented medical opinions as to Lt  Whiteside   s mental condition and their bearing on the case  Colonel Terrence J  McKenrick  commander of the Warrior Transition Brigade at Walter Reed  charged that even though medical professionals had determined Lt  Whiteside had a    severe mental disease or defect  she knowingly assaulted and threatened others and injured herself     Another commander wrote that Lt  Whiteside   s    defense that she suffers from a mental disease excusing her actions is just that   an excuse  an excuse to distract from choices and decisions made by Lt  Whiteside     These statements are contrary to the apparent recommendations of Lt  Whiteside   s battalion commander in Iraq that disciplinary actions not be taken  and show a callous disregard for the diagnosis of qualified psychiatrists at WRAMC  who found that Lt  Whiteside suffered from a    severe major depressive disorder and a personality disorder    and    disassociation with reality      We believe that service members should be held accountable for their actions  and we recognize that the Manual for Courts Martial provides procedures for handling mental health issues in judicial proceedings  However  this case highlights the need for the Department to review its administrative procedures and training programs to ensure that commanders give full and fair consideration of the recommendations made by trained mental health providers before initiating disciplinary actions against soldiers suffering from mental diseases   Additionally  as Senators who have worked extensively to improve mental health care services for our armed forces  we find it unacceptable that officers with no medical training   who are required by law to protect the impartiality of the military justice process   would make dismissive statements regarding Lt  Whiteside   s mental health condition  These comments only undermine respect for the mental health profession and increase the stigma associated with seeking mental health care   According to the Congressionally mandated report of the Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health     every military leader bears responsibility for addressing stigma  leaders who fail to do so reduce the effectiveness of the service members they lead     The Department is best served by ending policies that discriminate against service members who suffer from mental health problems and working to eliminate the stigma that prevents too many from seeking care  That is why we strongly urge you to ensure that the recommendations of qualified medical professionals play a clearly defined and important role in proceedings to discharge or punish any service member with an underlying mental health condition    Thank you for your consideration of this important request     Sincerely    Barbara Boxer                                             United States Senator                                    Christopher S  Bond  United States Senator
