   Wyden  Obama Introduce    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007      U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Wyden  Obama Introduce    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007    Wednesday  December  5  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jennifer Hoelzer  Wyden  or Amy Brundage  Obama  5 Star Safety Rating System Brings Transparency to Credit Card Agreements   Washington  D C      Working to give consumers the tools to make informed choices about complex credit card agreements  U S  Senators Ron Wyden  D OR  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007      The legislation creates a five star safety rating system for credit cards in order to increase the transparency of credit card agreements and encourage issuers to abandon abusive practices by offering consumers fair terms they can understand        This legislation will help people understand if they can expect their card issuer to treat them fairly  or kick them when they are down     said Wyden      With the financial future of so many Americans dependent upon unreadable jargon in credit card documents  arming consumers with usable information is more critical than ever           Consumers need some way to know which credit cards are safe and which ones are most likely to get them into financial trouble with fees  penalties  and charges     Senator Obama said      A Safety Star system is an innovative approach to require credit card companies to increase transparency and hold them accountable for any hidden charges or changes   This bill will give consumers a powerful tool to protect themselves  while giving credit card companies an incentive to improve their practices        Much like the five star crash test rating system for new cars  the    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007    will give consumers a window into the safety of their credit cards   Under the legislation  every credit card  billing statement  agreement  application  and piece of marketing material will be required to carry the credit card   s safety star rating  which will range anywhere from one to five stars  with five stars representing the safest cards       Cards will be awarded stars based on a points system  with cards earning points for consumer friendly terms and losing them for terms designed to get consumers into trouble   For example  card issuers that can change the terms of an agreement at any time for any reason would receive a one star safety rating   while credit cards that give 90 days notice before the issuer intends to change terms  or cards that write their agreements at an accessible reading level would get more stars       Under the Credit Card Safety Star rating system it is expected that most of the cards available on today   s market will rate an average of one or two stars   Similarly  when the five star crash rating system for new cars first came into existence  no car received more than two stars in any of its crash ratings   Today  however  many cars receive five star ratings   The Credit Card Safety Star program is designed to have a similar effect on the credit industry by forcing card issuers to compete on the basis of providing a consumer friendly product   Consumers prefer credit cards with fair terms  so they are more likely to choose cards with higher star ratings   Therefore  card issuers will have to improve their practices in order to attract and keep customers     The Credit Card Safety Star program would be administered by the Federal Reserve and periodically reevaluated and updated based on market innovations and the program   s effectiveness   Because some issuers may refuse to abandon some of their worst practices despite market competition  the program is designed to accommodate the possibility of further legislation or regulations eliminating such practices     According to data from the Federal Reserve and the U S  Census Bureau  in September 2007  U S  consumers were carrying close to  880 billion in credit card debt     nearly  2 900 for every man  woman and child in the country   Credit card debt has increased by almost  163 billion since 2004  an increase of over  500 per person in the U S   or 23  in just 3 years     For more information  including the complete bill                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
