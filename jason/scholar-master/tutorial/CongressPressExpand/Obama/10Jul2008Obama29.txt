Lobbying Law  Thursday  July 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT     Brian Fallon  Schumer   Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  DOJ Has Not Consistently Enforced Federal Law Requiring Disclosure of Foreign Influences on U S  Policy Democratic Senators Urge Inspector General to Examine DOJ Decision Making Behind Enforcement of Lobbying Regulations Senators Have Also Proposed Bill To Close Loophole Exempting Lobbyists For Foreign Corporations From Reporting Requirements WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Barack Obama  D IL   today called on the internal watchdog at the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to investigate the agency s spotty enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   a federal law requiring disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign entities such as governments and political parties  The senators believe that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of FARA  allowing certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad  the senators said   Too many lobbyists are skirting the law and operating in the shadows  and in too many cases  the Justice Department is standing at the light switch  refusing to turn it on  We want answers   Schumer said   The public has a right to know when our government is being lobbied by foreign interests and the Department of Justice has a responsibility to uphold and enforce the law in all circumstances    In a place where we need more transparency  not less  lapses in enforcement of lobbying disclosure laws should not be taken lightly   McCaskill said   This is serious matter  and I expect the Inspector General to address it head on to assure the enforcers are truly enforcing the law    It is unacceptable that lobbyists can exploit loopholes to hide their lobbying contacts on behalf of foreign businesses and governments   said Senator Obama    The American people have a right to know who these individuals are representing and which American officials they re lobbying   Abusing the law to hide access and special treatment is exactly the kind of Washington culture that I ve been fighting against   I am proud to stand with Senators Schumer and McCaskill to close these loopholes  and I call on the Justice Department to immediately investigate this abuse of the law   The intent of FARA  passed by Congress in 1938  was to bring transparency to the work of lobbyists representing foreign clients by requiring the lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice  But in recent months  multiple cases have surfaced where lobbyists acting as foreign agents have either registered with the DOJ late or not at all  Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless   Senators Schumer  McCaskill and Obama today asked the DOJ Inspector General for a report on the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law  The Senators have also called on the Inspector General to take appropriate steps within the Department to look at the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General with suggestions as to how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  In June  Senators Schumer  McCaskill  and Obama unveiled legislation that would close two loopholes allowing U S  lobbyists to influence government officials on behalf of foreign clients without having to disclose their activities  The Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  would require all lobbyists representing foreign clients to register under FARA  even if they have already registered under Lobbying Disclosure Act  LDA   Under current law  lobbyists registered under LDA are exempt from also registering under the more rigorous FARA  The bill would also require that any lobbying contacts with U S  officials on behalf of foreign clients be disclosed even when they occur outside of the United States  Currently  the law only covers contacts that occur  within the United States    A copy of the Senators  letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine is below     July 9  2008 Mr  Glenn A  Fine  United States Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Mr  Fine  It has come to our attention that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA    We would like to know more about the decision making process behind FARA enforcement and whether or not enforcement has been uneven or lax over time   As you are well aware  FARA was passed in 1938 and requires disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign governments  individuals  political parties  and corporations   Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad   Recently  we introduced the Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  in order to close two loopholes in the law that allow certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  We believe that the requirements under FARA are clear and should be enforced in all circumstances   Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless  We know that you share our commitment to maintaining the public s trust in government   We believe that allowing individuals to break the law and operate in the dark on behalf of foreign entities will erode this trust we hold so dear   Therefore  we request an examination of the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law    We hope that you take appropriate steps within your Department to look into the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General or his appropriate subordinate with suggestions on how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  We also request that you transmit to us  and the appropriate congressional committees of jurisdiction  a report on your findings  We look forward to hearing from you on this matter     Charles E  Schumer    United States Senator
