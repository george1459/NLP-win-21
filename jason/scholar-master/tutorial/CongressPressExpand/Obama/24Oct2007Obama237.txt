Honorable Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301 1000 Dear Secretary Gates    We are writing to request a full accounting from the Department of Defense on the number of psychological injuries sustained by service members since October 2001 and how the military reports on and invests in treating these less visible psychological injuries   Recent media accounts indicate that the number of service members seeking care for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  from the Veterans Administration  VA  jumped 70  over a 12 month period  or an increase of some 20 000 cases   In addition  reports of the total number of cases of PTSD treatment at the VA since 2001     50 000 cases     far exceed the number of wounded documented by the Pentagon     While the literature suggests that symptoms of psychological injuries such as PTSD often surface after the initial trauma  these reported numbers not only underscore the increase in demand for mental health resources among our veterans  but suggest that many of our brave active duty service members are sustaining less visible psychological injuries at a time when the military faces a severe shortage of behavioral health personnel   As a result  many of our warriors may lack access to care just at a time when early treatment could be beneficial   In light of the fact that mental health care is now the second largest area of VA treatment sought by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans  it is incumbent on the military to ensure it is providing adequate treatment before our warriors ever separate from service   Especially in combat theaters  where recent reports also suggest a spike in suicides  we must ensure service members facing the stress of combat operations have access to resources and care for psychological injuries    For these reasons  we ask that you provide the following information    What is the total number of cases of PTSD among active duty service members documented by each military department since October 2001   Please distinguish between those cases that were diagnosed in and out of a combat theater   Is this number reported in the Pentagon   s regular compilation of wounded injured figures  whether or not cases require a medical evacuation   Of this number  how many received treatment from a mental health professional    What is the total number of other reported psychological injuries documented by each military department since October 2001   Please distinguish between those cases that were diagnosed in and out of a combat theater   Is this number reported in the Pentagon   s regular compilation of wounded injured figures  whether or not cases require a medical evacuation   Of this number  how many received treatment from a mental health professional   What procedures and referral mechanisms are in place in each military department for a service member who may want to seek counseling in a combat theater   How are service members currently trained to identify symptoms of combat stress   What is the approximate number of mental health staff  differentiated by specialty  deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  by calendar quarter and military department  since October 2001   Of this number  on average how many are embedded with units in forward operating areas    What is the number of mental health staff  differentiated by specialty  for each major mobilization and demobilization Army and Marine Corps site  Please provide the number of military personnel assigned to each of these installations   What incentives are in place  or being considered  to attract additional behavioral health specialists  differentiated by specialty   For Fiscal Year 2002 through 2007  what has been the total annual expenditure  by quarter and military department  on mental health care for active duty service members   Of these totals  how much was expended for staffing  both for military personnel and private contractors    Caring for the mental health of our service members should be as important as caring for their physical wounds   Thank you for providing this information to our offices by November 13  2007    Sincerely  Barack Obama                                                                                        United States Senator                                                                             Christopher S  Bond       United States Senator
