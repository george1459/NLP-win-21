   Obama Urges Congress to Clear Way For More States to Pass Iran Divestment Legislation   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Urges Congress to Clear Way For More States to Pass Iran Divestment Legislation Thursday  July 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Congress to pass legislation that would clear the way for more states to divest their pension funds from businesses with assets in Iran   In May  Obama introduced the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act  S  1430   which empowers Americans to apply economic pressure on the Iranian regime by establishing a federal list of entities that invest in Iran and allowing for divestment   This legislation would enable investors and state and local governments to ensure they are not invested in companies that support Iran s oil and gas industry      The need for these laws is clear   said Senator Obama    Iran uses the revenue it generates from its energy sector to finance its pursuit of nuclear weapons and support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas  Along with a sustained diplomatic effort and toughened multilateral sanctions on Iran  divestment is a useful tool that state and local governments can use to increase economic pressure to persuade Iran to end its dangerous policies      In the past  Supreme Court decisions have called into question whether states have the constitutional authority to pass such laws   For that reason  Congress needs to pass the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act  S  1430  which I introduced in May   This bill would clarify that states have the authority to pass divestment legislation with respect to Iran  and provide information from the federal government to make it easier for them to do so   I am proud that fourteen of my colleagues have cosponsored this bill so far  but Iran s seeming unbridled drive for nuclear weapons makes this a matter of considerable urgency   I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in working to pass this legislation without delay
