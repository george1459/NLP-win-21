   Obama Statement on Supplemental Bill that Sets a Target Redeployment Date   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Supplemental Bill that Sets a Target Redeployment Date Thursday  April 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Says we are one signature away from ending Iraq War WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement after the Senate approved the supplemental funding bill that sets a target date to remove U S  combat troops from Iraq      We are one signature away from ending the Iraq War   President Bush must listen to the will of the American people and sign this bill so that our troops can come home          I opposed this war from the start   I said then that it would distract us from pursuing those who attacked us and would entangle us in an occupation of undetermined length  cost and consequences  This war has no military solution  and the Iraqi people need to take responsibility for their own future          That   s why I believe that my plan for a phased withdrawal with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31st  2008 is still the best way to pressure the warring factions to reach a political settlement necessary to end this war   This similar plan responsibly redeploys our troops from Iraq while protecting our interests in the wider Middle East   It ensures that we are as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in          All of us have been touched by the heroic sacrifices troops have made in service to our country    With the stroke of a pen  President Bush can bring them home to the families who love them and to a country ready to honor them for their service
