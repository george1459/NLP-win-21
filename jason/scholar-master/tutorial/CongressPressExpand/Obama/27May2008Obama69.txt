                  Durbin  Obama  Costello Request Meeting with VA Secretary to Discuss Marion VA  Tuesday  May 27  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or David Gillies  Costello  Senators ask for explanation of ABI investigation delay  WASHINGTON  D C    Two weeks after the Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  in Marion  Illinois resumed outpatient surgeries  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Jerry Costello  D IL  today requested a meeting with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  James Peake  to discuss the progress at the Marion facility   The Senators are asking for an update on the status of a pending Administrative Board of Investigation  ABI  report at the Marion facility to determine which individuals were responsible for allowing a decline in the quality of patient care  including nine deaths as a result of substandard care    As surgical procedures restart in Marion  it is important that we continue to work toward returning the VAMC to a full service medical facility   said Durbin    This can not be done before the conclusion of the ABI report and without a permanent leadership team in place   I expect the VA to make every effort to finish this report and implement the recommendations as soon as possible    Our nation s veterans should expect nothing less than the best care and treatment at veterans  facilities in Illinois and throughout the United States   said Obama   After last year s unacceptable tragedies at the Marion VA  we must do everything we can to guarantee that the VA maintains the highest standards for its medical personnel and operations  Our veterans must not be put in danger when they are seeking help  I am committed to working with Senator Durbin  my Illinois colleagues  and Secretary Peake to ensure this facility is once again capable of providing our veterans with the quality medical attention they deserve    While some progress is being made at Marion  there are still many questions that need to be answered   said Costello    A full public accounting of the problems at the facility needs to be made by the VA in order to move forward   In a February 19  2008 letter  Secretary Peake informed Senator Durbin that the ABI was interviewing VA employees and would complete its final report in April   Despite multiple inquires into the status of the ABI s final report no revised completion date has been offered   On May 8  the VAMC facility in Marion  Illinois resumed low risk  outpatient surgeries that had been suspended in August 2007 after an apparent spike in post surgical deaths     May 27  2008 The Honorable James B  Peake  M D    Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake  We are writing to urge the completion and release of the pending investigation at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  in Marion  Illinois  and request a meeting with you to discuss the situation there  For many years  veterans from Illinois  Indiana  and Kentucky have given high grades to the Marion VAMC   The men and women who work at the hospital today are committed to continuing to provide high quality care for our veterans  Unfortunately  poor leadership and communication led to serious problems at the facility last year  including surgical malfeasance associated with the deaths of nine veterans   The Veterans Administration  VA  reassigned five individuals  including the VAMC director  chief of staff  and chief of surgery  to non clinical areas after concerns about the quality of patient care at the facility arose in 2007  The reassignments became effective as early as September 14 of last year   After a three month delay  the VA convened an Administrative Board of Investigation  ABI  to determine which individuals at the Marion VAMC were responsible for allowing these serious problems to continue  In a February 19  2008 letter  you informed Senator Durbin that the ABI was interviewing VA employees and would complete its final report in April   That date has passed   Our staff has contacted your office on multiple occasions to inquire into the status of the ABI s final report   Your office has been unable to offer a completion date  We are also concerned that veterans are being asked to travel for surgical operations that once were available to them in Marion   While we are pleased that the VAMC resumed minor outpatient surgeries on May 8  we are looking for more information from you on the plans for returning the Marion VAMC to a full service medical facility  We request a meeting with you at your earliest availability to discuss the completion of the ABI report  the progress in hiring permanent hospital leadership  and the return of the high quality of care for which the Marion VAMC has historically been known    Sincerely                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
