Obama  Time To End Debate On Yucca  Find Alternatives Wednesday  October 31  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Obama Has Consistently Opposed Yucca Mountain as a Storage Site for Nuclear Waste WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  yesterday sent the following letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  EPW  Chairman Barbara Boxer  calling on them to use today s EPW Committee hearing on Yucca Mountain to explore new alternatives for safe  long term solutions for storing spent nuclear fuel     Obama  who has been a consistent opponent of Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository for nuclear waste  urged the Committee and federal government to move past the decades long debate on Yucca Mountain and focus on finding new alternatives to Yucca     In the letter  Obama stated   the selection of Yucca Mountain has failed  the time for debate on this site is over  and it is time to start exploring new alternatives for safe  long term solutions based on sound science     Below is a copy of Obama s letter     October 30  2007   The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  528 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510 The Honorable Barbara Boxer  Chairman  Committee on Environment and Public Works   410 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510 Dear Leader Reid and Chairman Boxer  I understand that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is holding a hearing on October 31 entitled   Examination of the Licensing Process for the Yucca Mountain Repository   at which Senator Reid is scheduled to testify   I know both of you have been working on this issue for many years  so I am writing to share my perspective on the issue given its importance to my home state of Illinois   Although I am no longer a member of the EPW Committee  I respectfully offer the following views and ask that they be included as part of the hearing record    Separately  I will be submitting questions for the hearing witnesses  Given the nation s rising energy demand and the serious problems posed by global climate change  we need to increase the use of carbon free energy sources  such as solar  wind  and geothermal energy   But we cannot deny that nuclear power is     and likely will remain     an important source of electricity for many years to come   How we deal with the dangerous byproduct of nuclear reactors is a critical question that has yet to be resolved     As you may know  Illinois has 11 nuclear reactors     more than any other state in the country   Nuclear power provides more than 50 percent of the electricity needs of Illinois   Where and how we store spent nuclear fuel is an extremely important issue for my constituents   Currently  in the absence of any alternative  spent nuclear fuel generated by Illinois  reactors is stored in Illinois    In 1987  Congress attempted to reach a national solution to the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste by abandoning the scientific consideration of a wide range of possible sites and instead unilaterally imposing a final decision to focus only on Yucca Mountain  Nevada   During the past 20 years  over the strong opposition of the people of Nevada  billions of dollars have been spent by taxpayers and ratepayers in the construction of this location   Millions of dollars have been spent on lawsuits  and hundreds of millions more will be spent in the future if the Department of Energy fails to meet its contractual obligations to nuclear utilities    Proponents suggest Yucca Mountain will not be ready to accept spent fuel shipments for another 10 years  more realistic prognostications suggest we are at least two decades from Yucca Mountain accepting shipments    Legitimate scientific questions have been raised about the safety of storing spent nuclear fuel at this location   With regard to Yucca Mountain  the National Academy of Sciences maintains that peak risks might occur hundreds of thousands of years from now   In 2004  a federal court questioned whether standards developed by the Environmental Protection Agency for the Yucca Mountain repository were sufficient to guarantee the safety of Nevadans   Questions also have been raised about the viability of transporting spent nuclear fuel to Nevada from different locations around the country   Although it would seem to serve the interests of Illinois     and other states with nuclear reactors     to send our waste to another state  transporting nuclear waste materials poses uncertain risk   In fact  since a large amount of this spent fuel would likely travel by rail  this is a serious concern for the people of Chicago  which is the transportation hub of the Midwest    Because of these safety issues and the unwavering opposition from the people of Nevada and their elected officials  there is strong reason to believe that many more billions of dollars could be expended on Yucca Mountain without any significant progress in moving towards a permanent solution to the problem of where to store spent nuclear fuel    For these reasons  I believe that it is no longer a sustainable federal policy for Yucca Mountain to be considered as a permanent repository   Instead of re examining the 20 year licensing process and the billions of dollars that have already been spent  the time has come for the federal government to refocus its resources on finding more viable alternatives for the storage of spent nuclear fuel   Among the possible alternatives that should be considered are finding another state willing to serve as a permanent national repository or creating regional storage repositories  The federal government should also redirect resources toward improving the safety and security of spent fuel at plant sites around the country until a safe  long term solution can be implemented    Regardless of what alternative is pursued  two premises should guide federal decision making   First  any storage option should be supported by sound science   We need to ensure that nuclear waste can be safely stored without polluting aquifers or soil and exposing nearby residents to toxic radiation    Second  we should select a repository location through a process that develops national consensus and respects state sovereignty  not one in which the federal government cuts off debate and forces one state to accept nuclear waste from other states   The flawed process by which Yucca Mountain was selected now manifests itself as a profoundly expensive endeavor of monumental proportion      In short  the selection of Yucca Mountain has failed  the time for debate on this site is over  and it is time to start exploring new alternatives for safe  long term solutions based on sound science   I thank you both for your leadership on this issue  and I appreciate your consideration of my views   Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator
