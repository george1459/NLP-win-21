Ortiz  Obama   Jordan Stark  Hagel   Ciaran Clayton  Cantwell   or Derrick Crowe  Smith  Legislation would aim to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Congressman Adam Smith  D WA  today hailed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee s passage of the Global Poverty Act  S 2433   which requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs  This legislation was introduced in December   Smith and Congressman Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House last September    With billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world  global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces   said Senator Obama   It must be a priority of American foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water  As we strive to rebuild America s standing in the world  this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere  I commend Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar for supporting this bill and moving it forward quickly    Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century   Senator Hagel said    This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world    Global poverty directly impacts our national security  We must rally private sector and government resources to eliminate extreme global poverty and to fight global disease   said Senator Cantwell    With more than 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day  it is of the utmost importance to make sure these people get the help they need and push for sustainable economic growth  We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries and extend our hand to people in need      Global poverty is one of the greatest moral and security challenges facing the world today  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion live on less than  1 a day   This bill represents a major advance in our effort to address global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I am pleased to see the Senate Foreign Relations Committee take significant steps toward its final passage   Congressman Smith said   For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world s poorest people  In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015  We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act   Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015   Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables     Requires the President to report back to
