 Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  President  We are writing in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request for a major disaster declaration for Winnebago County and Stephenson County as a result of flooding beginning August 7 and continuing through August 8  2007    Preliminary assessments indicate that homes and businesses located in the path of the rapidly rising flood water in the City of Freeport in Stephenson County and the Village of Cherry Valley and the City of Rockford in Winnebago County received the most severe impacts of the flash flooding   These homes and businesses sustained structural damage to basements  foundations  and first floor living areas   The electrical  heating  air conditioning and ventilation systems in hundreds of homes sustained major damage   Governor Blagojevich declared Winnebago County a disaster area on August 7  2007 and declared Stephenson County a disaster area on August 8  2007    The damage assessment found that 820 single or multi family homes were impacted by the floodwaters  many sustaining major damage   Specifically  245 single family homes and 52 multi family homes were affected by floodwaters  73 single family homes and 43 multi family homes sustained major damage  and 274 single family homes and 121 multi family homes suffered minor damage   Twelve single family homes were destroyed  This is the second time in eleven months that the same area in Winnebago County  primarily in the City of Rockford  has been devastated by a flash flood   Governor Blagojevich   s request for disaster assistance regarding the previous flood and his subsequent appeal were denied   As the community is still struggling to recover from last year   s Labor Day flash flood  the need for federal disaster assistance is greater      We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of Winnebago County and Stephenson County can receive federal disaster assistance   Specifically  we support the Governor   s request for Individual Assistance  including the Individuals and Households Program  and Small Business disaster loans   We also support the request for Hazard Mitigation Assistance for all counties statewide   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any appropriate way  Sincerely     Richard Durbin  United States Senator                                                   Barack Obama                           United States Senator                 Donald Manzullo  United States Representative
