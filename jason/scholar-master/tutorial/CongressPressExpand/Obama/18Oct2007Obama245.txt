   Obama Calls on Gates to Ensure All Service Members Receive Full Educational Benefits   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Calls on Gates to Ensure All Service Members Receive Full Educational Benefits Wednesday  October 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Urges Gates to Consider Waivers to Get National Guard and Reservists Benefits They Deserve   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  expressing concerns that some members of the National Guard and Reserves are being denied educational benefits they deserve after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   Members of the National Guard and Reserves are required to serve for 730 days in order to receive the education benefits earned by those who serve in active duty   However  according to news reports  many returning National Guard and Reservists have discovered that they will not receive these benefits either because their service fell a few days short of 730 days  or because their service orders were issued for a few days less than 730 days  In the letter  Obama  a member of the Senate Veterans    Affairs Committee  calls on Gates to clarify the Department   s authority to provide waivers for these service members  evaluate how widespread the problem is  and propose recommendations to resolve this problem     The fact that those men and women in the National Guard and Reserves who put their lives on the line to serve their country are being denied full educational benefits is simply wrong  and we need to fix this problem today     Senator Obama said      Like members of our military serving in active duty  service members in National Guard and Reserve leave their families  and risk life and limb for our country   There is no reason that they should have to fight this kind of bureaucratic mess to be able to access the benefits they deserve when they come home   I urge Secretary Gates to address this issue as soon as possible and consider any options that will allow us to fully keep promise to these heroes and their families     Below is a copy of the letter     October 16  2007 The Honorable Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301 1000 Dear Secretary Gates   As you know  in many cases  members of the National Guard and Reserves are required to serve for 730 days in order to receive the level of educational benefits afforded to their active duty counterparts   However  according to recent news accounts  a number of returning service members have discovered that they will not receive these benefits either because they served a few days less than 730 days  or because their service orders were issued for a few days less than 730 days    I believe that these members of the National Guard and Reserves are being unfairly treated  and I ask that you exercise some flexibility and  where appropriate  grant waivers from this service requirement for educational benefits  This problem is just one challenge presented by the complexity of the current maze of educational benefits and the varying eligibility requirements facing our returning service members   Even as Congress works to update these benefits  slash red tape  and ensure fairness and equity for our service members  I would ask that you respond to these interim questions   What statutory authority  if any  does the Department of Defense currently have to provide waivers for those cases in which members of the Guard or Reserves have fulfilled their commitment to serve our nation but have fallen short of receiving benefits that are due to their active duty counterparts   What plans are underway to review orders issued since 9 11 to Guard members and Reservists to determine how widespread this problem is  and does the Pentagon plan to provide waivers for these cases   If so  what would be the military   s threshold for time served in order to grant the more generous educational benefit to members of the Guard and Reserves until the law can be revised   What legislative changes would the Department recommend to correct the inequities in the eligibility criteria for educational benefits for our service members   While there are different views of the war in our country  I know there is no disagreement about the tremendous sacrifice being made by the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have performed valiantly under exceedingly difficult circumstances   They have done everything that we have asked of them   And at a minimum  we owe them educational benefits that are understandable  accessible  and are commensurate with their noble service   For that reason  I ask that you exercise some degree of flexibility in addressing cases of Guard and Reserve members who have fallen a few days short of receiving the educational benefits they deserve and  wherever appropriate  I ask that you grant waivers from this service requirement   Thank you for your consideration to this request     Sincerely     Barack Obama   United States Senator
