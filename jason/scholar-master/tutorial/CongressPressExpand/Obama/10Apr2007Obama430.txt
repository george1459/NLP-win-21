   Obama Calls on IRS to Protect Taxpayers    Privacy   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on IRS to Protect Taxpayers    Privacy Monday  April  9  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Following reports of lax security procedures  asks for investigation  solution WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter calling on Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Mark Everson to fully account for the loss of computers containing sensitive taxpayer information  to audit vulnerabilities taxpayers face when they turn over personal information to the IRS  and to find a solution that protects taxpayers    privacy   The Washington Post reported last week that an Inspector General report found that    thousands of taxpayers could be at risk of identity theft or other financial fraud because the Internal Revenue Service has failed to adequately protect information on its 52 000 laptop computers and other storage systems    and that 500 IRS laptops that may have contained sensitive information were lost or stolen in a 3    year period   The text of the letter is below    Dear Commissioner Everson   When the federal government demands sensitive personal and financial information from taxpayers in order to assess or verify tax liability  the government has a duty to protect and safeguard that information   And yet  as the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported last month  IRS officials have failed to respond adequately to the loss or theft of hundreds of computers containing sensitive information   The report notes that    it is likely that  sensitive data for a significant number of taxpayers have been unnecessarily exposed to potential identity theft and or other fraudulent schemes     When ChoicePoint and Lexis Nexis had security breaches in 2005  hundreds of thousands of consumers were at risk of having their personal information exposed and their identities stolen   Congress will not tolerate this level of potential exposure to privacy violations by the private sector and we cannot tolerate it by the IRS or any government agency   The federal government must be a good steward of the information with which we are entrusted  or we breach the trust that entitles us to require that information in the first place   Since Americans have no choice in sharing their personal information with the IRS  the IRS has an obligation to ensure that its data security system is foolproof and that their privacy is protected   The job of the IRS is one of the most complicated in the federal government because our tax code is a mess and because Congress and the President rely on the IRS to administer many federal policies   You should be commended for your efforts to reduce the tax gap and to improve administration of the nation s single most effective anti poverty program  the EITC   There s no question that most IRS employees work hard and want to do the right thing   But let s not jeopardize the good work of the IRS by failing to address immediately the weaknesses that have been identified and working proactively to prevent similar problems in the future   The IRS has reportedly adopted new security training  software  and hardware solutions to mitigate the risks of data loss in the future   These are welcome improvements   But  without exaggerating or downplaying the scope of the problems involved  we owe the American people answers   I am requesting that you provide to my office   1  a fuller accounting of what went wrong and how it happened  2  a general audit of taxpayer privacy vulnerabilities under current  or any proposed  IRS practices and procedures  3  a clear reporting about what s being done to ensure that the problems are fixed and all significant security gaps are closed  4  a plan to identify and remedy whatever harm may have come to the victims of lax IRS security  including the notification of taxpayers whose data security was compromised  This information can and should be used to strengthen data security by the IRS and other federal agencies and to inform public policies related to data privacy   I look forward to continuing to work on this issue with you   Please outline your findings  plans  and conclusions with regard to numbers 1 4 above and respond to my office within two weeks
