   Obama Calls on President to Take Immediate Action to Protect Our Children From Lead  Tainted Toys   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on President to Take Immediate Action to Protect Our Children From Lead  Tainted Toys Wednesday  August 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Obama Press Office 202 228 5566 Consumer Product Safety Commission has been without a chair for 13 months WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  urging him to do everything possible to protect our children from toys contaminated with lead   In the letter  Obama calls on the President to immediately nominate a chairman to the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  who will be a forceful advocate for the interests of American parents   Since July 2006  the CPSC has been operating without a full set of commissioners  preventing the remaining two commissioners from voting on civil penalties or taking regulatory action   Obama also requests that the President support a funding increase for the CPSC to protect America   s children from lead contaminated toys   In November 2005  Obama introduced the Lead Free Toys Act to provide the CPSC with the authority to ban children   s products containing lead as hazardous substances  The text of the letter is below  Dear President Bush  In light of the recent recalls of lead contaminated toys manufactured in China  it is incumbent upon our government and our business to do everything possible to protect our children from dangerous products   For that reason  I have written over the past two weeks to the Senate Commerce Committee  the Toy Industry Association  and the U S  Trade Representative urging immediate action to rid the marketplace of toys containing lead paint    The White House can     and should     take immediate action as well  including   nominating a chairman to the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  who is committed to the interests of consumers  instead of industry  and increasing the CPSC   s resources and authority   In recent months  there have been a number of high profile recalls of children   s products manufactured in China involving lead paint   Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health problems in young children including IQ deficiencies  reading and learning disabilities  reduced attention spans  hyperactivity  and damage to the kidneys  brain and bone marrow    Some of the recent recalls of Chinese manufactured toys include  In March 2007  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  announced three separate recalls of 108 600 units of children s necklaces and 128 700    Elite Operations    toy sets due to high lead paint content   In April  4 million    Groovy Grabber    bracelets and 396 000 metal key chains were recalled because of high lead content   In May  103 000 pieces of metal jewelry marketed in conjunction with    High School Musical    were recalled because of high lead content   In June  the RC2 Corporation recalled 1 5 million Thomas   Friends wooden toy railway sets that were coated with excessive levels of lead paint    Two weeks ago  Mattel announced the recall of 83 types of toys worldwide because the paint in the toys contained excessive amounts of lead   This worldwide recall involved almost 1 million plastic preschool toys  including the popular Big Bird  Elmo  Dora and Diego characters    And just yesterday  Mattel announced the recall of 253 000 toy jeeps featuring the Sarge character from the movie    Cars    due to lead paint on the jeeps    The CPSC is the primary federal agency charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of serious injury or death   However  since July 2006  the CPSC has been operating without a full set of commissioners   According to the Consumer Product Safety Act  the two remaining commissioners can continue their regulatory activities for six months after a vacancy  but after those six months  a commission with only two members is not able to vote on civil penalties or take regulatory action   It has now been thirteen months without a full commission  In order for the CPSC to safeguard the interests of our most vulnerable consumers    our children    it is important that a third commissioner be named as soon as possible   And  because the current vacancy is for a new chairman  it is important to name someone who has a longstanding commitment to consumer protection   Unfortunately  the background of your first nominee for the chairman position did not indicate such a commitment  In March  you nominated Michael E  Baroody  executive vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM   to be the CPSC chairman   A number of well respected advocacy groups objected to Mr  Baroody   s nomination because of his history of working to    dilute safety proposals pending before the Commission      Among the initiatives Mr  Baroody spearheaded at NAM was opposition to a CPSC proposal to improve safety standards for baby walkers   Further raising concerns about Mr  Baroody   s ability to act independently from the industry that he was supposed to be regulating was his acceptance of a  150 000 severance payment from NAM   Mr  Bardoody withdrew his nomination in May      Leading the nation   s premier product safety commission is an important responsibility that should be entrusted to someone who can be a forceful advocate for the CPSC   s mission   I urge you to nominate someone quickly who will safeguard the interests of American parents  instead of manufacturers    In addition to nominating a new chairman    which will give the CPSC the required number of members to take regulatory action    it is important that the commission be given the resources it needs to perform its mission   For the last several years  the commission   s funding has hovered around  60 million annually even though more and more foreign manufactured consumer products are entering the market   The number of full time staffers at CPSC has also shrunk to about 400 employees  less than half the size of the staff in 1980  Recently  the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill to increase the CPSC budget to  70 million     7 2 million above last year   s amount and  6 8 million above the Administration   s budget request   If the Administration is serious about protecting America   s children from dangerous toys  I ask you to publicly announce your support for this funding increase   Moreover  the CPSC should have the authority to ban children   s products containing lead as hazardous substances   That is exactly what the Lead Free Toys Act  which I introduced in both the 109th and 110th Congresses  would do   I hope the Administration will consider supporting this important legislation  The American people     and in particular  American parents     trust that the products they are purchasing have undergone a thorough inspection and are safe to use   We need to ensure that their trust is not misplaced  and so I call on you to take immediate steps to allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to function more effectively   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
