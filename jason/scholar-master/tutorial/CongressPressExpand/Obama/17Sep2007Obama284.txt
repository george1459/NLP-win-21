   Obama Statement on Indian Health Care Improvement Act   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Obama Statement on Indian Health Care Improvement Act Wednesday  September 12  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511   WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  made the following statement on the Medicare  Medicaid and SCHIP Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2007  which passed out of the Senate Finance Committee today     For more than 14 years  Congress has failed to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and complete a comprehensive review and modernization of Native American health care   This is simply unacceptable     As infant mortality and suicide rates escalate and more and more Native Americans suffer from debilitating diseases like diabetes  modernizing and improving Native American health care could not come at a more urgent time     While the U S  government has a responsibility to provide health care stemming from treaty obligations  it is also this country s moral imperative to address the significant health care disparities between the Native American population and the American population as a whole   We must ensure our tribal health care programs are adequately prepared to provide preventative health care as well as treatment for substance and alcohol abuse  domestic violence  and mental health issues   Native Americans also deserve the same high quality health care professionals that care for families throughout the country     With 21st century health care challenges  it s inconceivable that Native Americans are receiving 20th century solutions   This Congress has a unique opportunity to make this bill law   I am proud to cosponsor this bill and I strongly urge its swift passage in the Senate
