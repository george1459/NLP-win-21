Illinois Thursday  April  3  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Obama cosponsored legislation in 2005 to restore grant funding WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  joined a bipartisan coalition of senators in calling on the Senate Appropriations Committee to fully fund the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  Byrne JAG  Program in this year s Supplemental Appropriations bill   For more than two decades  the Byrne JAG program has provided funding each year for nearly 4 000 state and local law enforcement officials to help make communities safer and improve criminal justice programs    Last year  the Senate approved  660 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget for this program   However  facing a veto threat from the President  this critical funding was reduced to  170 million in the Omnibus Appropriations package     Keeping our communities safe and ensuring that our justice system is fair and effective are top priorities for me in Illinois and throughout the country   said Senator Obama    Since I first met with local law enforcement officials in Alton in 2005 to discuss the growing threats posed to our neighborhoods by meth production and addiction  I have consistently demanded that the President increase funding for the Byrne program   Nearly three years after I joined to introduce legislation to restore this funding  the President has once again slashed these funds   This is unacceptable  and I will work with my colleagues to restore this funding as soon as possible    Since 2005  Senator Obama has urged his Senate colleagues and the President to increase funding for this program  In August of that year  Obama met with nearly a dozen local law enforcement officials and prosecutors at the Alton Law Enforcement Center in Madison County to hear first hand accounts of their experience with problems caused by meth use and production   These officers and prosecutors primarily expressed their concerns about the negative impact these funding cuts would have on drug investigations  particularly relating to meth  throughout the state   After hearing these concerns  Obama returned to Washington and joined several of his colleagues to introduce legislation to save the Byrne JAG program    The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran  Restoration of severe cuts made to the Edward Byrne Justice Grant  Byrne JAG  program through last year s omnibus appropriations bill is vital to avoid law enforcement layoffs and suspension of hundreds of anti drug  gang and violent offender efforts across the country   Therefore  we respectfully request that you provide  489 6 million for the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  Byrne JAG  program in any Supplemental Appropriations bill that comes before the Senate   This addition would restore Byrne JAG funding to the same level previously approved by the Senate in the Commerce Justice Science  CJS  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008  FY 2008   The Byrne Formula Grant Program is a tried and tested program that has served us well for more than two decades   The program s broad based support was verified in the Senate s passage last year of S 231  the Feinstein Chambliss Byrne JAG Reauthorization Act  which would extend this  1 095 bill authorization through 2012   The bill received 52 co sponsors and passed the Senate by unanimous consent   As you know  the Senate approved CJS Appropriations bill for FY2008 would have funded Byrne JAG at  660 million   Following a veto threat  however  difficult choices had to be made in conference  and in the Omnibus Appropriations bill that ultimately passed  Byrne JAG funding for FY2008 was reduced to only  170 4 million   This figure represented more than a 2 3 drop from Byrne JAG s actual appropriated levels in FY2007  In the wake of these drastic cuts  various law enforcement agencies  as well as numerous police and sheriff s offices  have notified us that these FY2008 Byrne JAG cuts will have a devastating effect on law enforcement  forcing them to possibly close multi jurisdictional drug and gang task forces  and negatively affecting a variety of other crime control programs   Particularly at a time when a risk of adverse economic conditions may lead to increased crime  it is vitally important that we support our nation s finest in their efforts on the front lines  where they risk their lives daily keeping Americans safe  Unless these Byrne JAG funds are restored promptly  law enforcement agencies may be forced to dismantle multi jurisdiction task forces that often took years to create and develop   And individual officers serving on those task force members will face a loss of income or even their jobs  some of which have been held for years  Each year  Byrne JAG dollars fund over 4 000 police officers and prosecutors working on over 750 drug enforcement task forces in all 50 states across hundreds of urban and rural countries and cities   On an annual basis  Byrne JAG funding leads to over 220 000 arrests  54 000 weapons seized  the seizure of 5 5 million grams of methamphetamine  and the breakup of almost 9 000 methamphetamine labs   These successes show that we need to continue what we are doing  not cut back  Funding for Byrne JAG  at its  1 095 billion authorized level  has long been supported by America s leading law enforcement organizations  including the National Narcotic Officers  Associations  Coalition  National Sheriffs  Association  National Association of Counties  National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors  Legal Action Center  National District Attorneys  Association  National HIDTA Directors Association  International Association of Chiefs of Police  Major County Sheriffs Association  National Criminal Justice Association  National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies  Major City Chiefs Association  National Troopers Coalition  State Association of Addiction Services  the National Crime Prevention Council and the Fraternal Order of Police  There is strong bipartisan support for the Byrne JAG Program  and we urge you to provide this critically needed funding in any supplemental appropriations bill that comes before the Senate this year                                Pursuant to
