 the Dalai Lama Monday  April  7  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Gordon Smith  R Ore   today led a bipartisan group of Senators that introduced a resolution condemning the violence in Tibet  The resolution also calls on China to open substantive dialogue with His Holiness  the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet    The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Joseph Biden  D Del    Amy Klobuchar  D Minn    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio   Elizabeth Dole  R N C    Maria Cantwell  D Wash    Olympia Snowe  R Maine   Robert Menendez  D N J    Susan Collins  R Maine   Barack Obama  D Ill    Senator Robert Byrd  D W V    Senator George Voinovich  R Ohio   Charles Schumer  D N Y    and Patty Murray  D Wash     The resolution introduced today comes in the wake of protests that have swept across Tibet  and reports that these protests have been met with overwhelming force and a crackdown by the Chinese government  Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of fatalities  and the arrest of more than 1 000 protesters in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of China    As a friend of China and the Dalai Lama  I am saddened to see the situation in Tibet deteriorate to this point   Senator Feinstein said   Violence cannot solve this matter   The United States must use its influence to bring the Government of China and the people of Tibet together to begin the process of reconciliation and dialogue    In the 1990s  I carried three letters to President Jiang Zemin from the Dalai Lama requesting a face to face meeting   Six rounds of talks since 2002 between the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China and representatives of His Holiness have not yielded any results   So  I urge the leadership in China to begin the process of open substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama on meaningful Tibetan religious and cultural autonomy within the People s Republic of China     Senator Smith said   China s violent crackdown on the people of Tibet is inexcusable  They have long sought acceptance among the ranks of global leaders  but the methodical and brutal oppression of free speech  political protest and the repression of an entire ethnic population are not the actions of a world leader  The Chinese government must act immediately to end the violence    It is critical that the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama engage in a mutually respectful dialogue to restore peace and stability in Tibet   said Senator Biden   By engaging in talks with Tibet instead of violence  President Hu would gain the opportunity to speak the motto of the Beijing Olympics    One World  One Dream    to the entire international community  I can think of no greater symbol of peace than to have President Hu Jin tao and the Dalai Lama jointly attend the opening ceremony of the games  united in their commitment to promote genuine reconciliation on the Tibetan plateau   Specifically  the resolution  Condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the Government of the People s Republic of China and the people of Tibet  Calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China and urges that these discussions take place with all deliberate speed   Calls for the release of individuals who protested in a peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and wounded in the violence that followed the protests   Calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts to enter monasteries to  reeducate  monks and nuns  to respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph  and to respect and protect basic human rights  as provided in the Constitution of the People s Republic of China   Calls on the Government of China to honor its commitment to allow international journalists free access to China from mid 2007 to October 17  2008   Calls on the Government of China to provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet  the response of the Government of China  and the manner and number of detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests   Calls on the United States Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002  22 USC 6901 note   including the stipulation that the Secretary of State  seek to establish an office in Lhasa  Tibet to monitor political  economic  and cultural developments in Tibet   and also to provide consular protection and citizen services in emergencies  and Urges that the agreement to permit China to open further diplomatic missions in the United States should be contingent upon the establishment of a United States Government office in Lhasa  Tibet    China s crackdown on the people of Tibet is inexcusable   Senator Brown said   Beijing has long sought a place at the table of global leaders  But systematic and violent repression of free speech  political protest and the eradication of ethnic culture  religion  and language are not the acts of a world leader  nor a country we should be striving to open to free trade  President Hu Jintao must take immediate steps to end the violent repression  open up to western media and release all political prisoners    In order to reach its full potential as a global leader  China must respect human rights and religious freedom of all its citizens   said Senator Cantwell    Dialogue with the Dalai Lama is essential   Senator Menendez said   The people of Tibet deserve communication  not crackdowns from the Chinese government  If they choose to voice their opinions  they deserve the right to be treated with civility and humanity  Instead  they are met with deadly violence  It s time for the dialogue to begin and the Dalai Lama to be included     Every day we learn about the tragedies facing the Tibetan people  and I condemn the use of violence to confront peaceful protests   said Senator Obama    It s time that the Chinese government respect and protect the basic human rights  religion  and culture of the Tibetan people   Senator Dole said   Particularly as the world prepares to turn its attention to the summer 2008 Beijing Olympic Games  China should be taking steps to improve its human rights and religious freedom record   Unfortunately  China instead has engaged in a harsh repression of the people of Tibet  adding to their already negative influence in the crackdown in Burma   The violence needs to end     Following is the text of the resolution introduced today   Whereas  beginning on March 10  2008  Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhist monks began demonstrations in Lhasa  the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People s Republic of China  Whereas those protests spread to elsewhere in the Tibet Autonomous Region and to Tibetan autonomous areas in the Sichuan  Gansu  and Qinghan provinces of China  Whereas  long suppressed resentment prompted violent clashes between demonstrators and government forces in the streets of Lhasa  resulting in innocent civilian casualties  the burning of buildings  and extensive property damage  Whereas Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of fatalities  and the arrest of more than 1 000 protesters in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of China  Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism  Whereas  the Government of China continues to restrict the rights of Tibetan Buddhists to practice their religion freely  Whereas the Dalai Lama has condemned the violence that began on March 14  2008  and announced his continuing support for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing  China  Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he does not seek independence for Tibet from China and has called for negotiations to bring about meaningful autonomy for Tibet that allows Tibetans to maintain their distinctive identity within China  Whereas the Constitution of the People s Republic of China guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens  but the 2007 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom of the Department of State states that   d uring the period covered by this report  the Government  of China  s respect for freedom of religion remained poor   and Whereas  following the demonstrations that began on March 10  2008  the Government of China began severely restricting access to journalists and diplomats and creating a shortage of independent verification of the situation on the ground in Tibet  Now  therefore  be it Resolved  That the Senate    1  condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the Government of the People s Republic of China and the people of Tibet   2  calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China and urges that these discussions take place with all deliberate speed   3  calls for the release of individuals who protested in a peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and wounded in the violence that followed the protests   4  calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts to enter monasteries to  reeducate  monks and nuns  to respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph  and to respect and protect basic human rights  as provided in the Constitution of the People s Republic of China   5  calls on the Government of China to honor its commitment to allow international journalists free access to China from mid 2007 to October 17  2008   6  calls on the Government of China to provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet  the response of the Government of China  and the manner and number of detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests  and  7  both     A  calls on the United States Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002  22 USC 6901 note   including the stipulation that the Secretary of State  seek to establish an office in Lhasa  Tibet to monitor political  economic  and cultural developments in Tibet   and also to provide consular protection and citizen services in emergencies  and  B  urges that the agreement to permit China to open further diplomatic missions in the United States should be contingent upon the establishment of a United States Government office in Lhasa  Tibet                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
