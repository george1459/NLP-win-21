   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting  Thursday  July 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Michael Ortiz Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice s attendance at the ASEAN Regional Forum  ARF  Ministerial meeting in Singapore is an opportunity for us to reflect on the relationship between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and indeed Southeast Asia itself   After September 11  official U S  attention returned to Southeast Asia focusing especially on concerns about Islamic extremism in the region  This threat remains  coming from a small number of extremists living amidst a broadly tolerant and moderate Muslim population in Southeast Asia   But it must not be the sum total of our attention and interest in the region  Our alliances with Thailand and the Philippines  and special relationship with Singapore  remain critical components of our regional presence  Relations with Indonesia  Malaysia  and Vietnam will only become more essential to the security and prosperity of the United States  and the world  in coming years    Half of the world s oil passes through Southeast Asia s sea lanes  as does a third of global trade   U S  trade with the ten nations of ASEAN is more than  170 billion per year  making the region as a whole our fourth largest trading partner    ASEAN s impact extends beyond Southeast Asia and provides the model for  and in some cases the core of  many transnational institutions in the Asia Pacific region   ASEAN has led efforts to construct new vehicles for regional cooperation and confidence building among nations with histories of tension and mistrust  The ASEAN Regional Forum is one such organization   These efforts have helpfully supplemented the existing regional security arrangements  notably the U S  system of alliances  that have underwritten stability for generations   ASEAN is at a crossroads in its own institutional development  and in its relations with the United States    The new ASEAN Charter offers the promise of a more cohesive and assertive institution  one that demands respect for human rights from its member states  These emerging trends need to be strengthened  and I join the growing number of those in Southeast Asia who recognize that what happens in one ASEAN member country often affects the interests of others  As a U S  Senator  I will support ASEAN s efforts to evolve to accommodate this era of increasing inter dependency    I remain particularly concerned about conditions in Burma  I commend ASEAN for its attempts to reach the suffering people in southern Burma  who continue to struggle in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis  But more needs to be done to reach them  I hope the upcoming ARF meeting deals directly with this issue  as well as with broader plans for regional cooperation on humanitarian assistance to the country   I urge ASEAN to take the lead in a broader  long term effort to effect a coordinated international response to the situation in Burma that can encourage the junta toward reform and true national reconciliation in that country     The United States needs to strengthen its relationship with ASEAN  and we have some new opportunities to do just that   But to do so we must listen to the region s concerns and be part of the regional discussion  The United States should hold summit meetings with ASEAN s leaders   In addition  I am pleased that the United States is the first country to have an Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs  but that is only a beginning step   We should encourage others in the Asia Pacific region to work with us to strengthen ASEAN and to address a growing list of developmental challenges and new security threats  such as infectious disease  drug and human trafficking  environmental degradation  climate change  energy security and disaster mitigation  Attendance at Asian regional meetings sends important signals to the region s leaders about the importance of East Asia  and particularly Southeast Asia  to the continued security and prosperity of the United States   We should demonstrate unmistakably through our high level participation in such forums that our interests are profoundly engaged in the region  I have a deep personal interest in Southeast Asia  for four of the first ten years of my life  I lived in Indonesia with my mother and sister  My years there gave me an appreciation for the region s rich diversity of cultures  societies  and traditions  Our policy toward Southeast Asia should reflect an understanding of that diversity  and of the increasing importance of the region to the peace  stability and prosperity of the United States and the broader international community
