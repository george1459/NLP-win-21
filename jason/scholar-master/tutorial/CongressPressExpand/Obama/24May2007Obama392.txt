   Obama  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Should be Tough  Respect Nation   s Values   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Should be Tough  Respect Nation   s Values Wednesday  May 23  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today spoke on the Senate floor about comprehensive immigration reform  saying comprehensive and bipartisan immigration reform is necessary and should strengthen our security  promote our economic interests  and reaffirm our heritage as a nation of immigrants   Obama announced plans to introduce an amendment with Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  that would remove that arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family preference is considered and increase the points for family ties   Under the current agreement  an applicant would have to obtain 55 points through other criteria before receiving points for family ties   He said he intends to introduce a second amendment with Senator Menendez that would sunset the immigration point system in five years and call on Congress to examine the consequences of the program and determine whether it should continue   Senator Obama   s floor statement is below       Last year  I spoke at one of the marches in Chicago for comprehensive immigration reform   I looked out across the faces in the crowd  I saw mothers and fathers  citizens and immigrants  people of Polish and Mexican descent  working Americans  and children          And what I know is that these are people we should embrace  not fear   We can and should be able to see ourselves in them          I do not say that to diminish the complexity of the task   I say it because I believe it must guide our discourse   We can and should be able to fix our broken immigration system   I think the bill that has come to the floor is a fine first step  but it still requires some changes  and I am working with others to improve it           In approaching immigration reform  I believe that we must enact tough  practical reforms that ensure and promote the legal and orderly entry of immigrants into our country   Just as important  we must respect the humanity of the carpenters and bricklayers who help build America  the humanity of garment workers and farm workers who come to America to join their families  the humanity of the students like my father who come to America in search of the dream   We are a nation of immigrants  and we must respect that shared history as this debate moves forward          To fix the system in a way that does not require us to revisit the same problem in twenty years  I continue to believe that we need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace   And that means a workable mandatory system that employers must use to verify the legality of their workers          But for reform to work  we also must respond to what pulls people to America and what pushes them out of their home countries   Where we can reunite families  we should   Where we can bring in more foreign born workers with the skills our economy needs  we should   And these goals are not mutually exclusive   We should not say that Spanish speaking or working class immigrants are only good enough to be temporary workers and cannot earn the right to be part of the American family          With regard to the most pressing part of the immigration challenge     the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U S      we must create an earned path to citizenship   Now  no one condones unauthorized entry into the United States   And by supporting an earned path to citizenship  I am not saying that illegal entry should go unpunished   The path to permanent residence and eventual citizenship must be tough enough to make it clear that unauthorized entry was wrong          But these immigrants are our neighbors   They go to our churches  and their kids go to our schools   They provide the hard labor that supports many of the industries in our country   We should bring them out of hiding  make them pay the appropriate fines for their mistakes  and then help them become tax paying  law abiding  productive members of society          I am heartened by the agreement that we have to put all 12 million undocumented immigrants on a path to earned citizenship   But there are other parts of the compromise deal before us that cause me serious concern           Let me briefly address some of those concerns          In order to stem the demand for illegal workers  we need a mandatory employment verification system that is actually mandatory   It needs to allow employers to check with the Department of Homeland Security to see that their employees are legally eligible to work in the United States   This is something I worked on last year   But this year   s version of the employment eligibility verification system would give DHS too much power to force the screening of everyone working in America without appropriate safeguards   I will be working with others to offer an amendment to make this provision closer to what we proposed last year          As for the guestworker program in the bill  it proposes to create a new 400 000 person annual temporary worker program that could grow to 600 000 without Congressional approval   And it expands the existing seasonal guestworker programs from 66 000 up to 100 000 in the first year and 200 000 after that   At the end of their temporary status  almost all of these workers would have to go home   That means at the end of the first three years  we would have at least 1 2 million of these new guestworkers in the country with only 30 000 of those having any real hope of getting to stay   That will just create a new undocumented immigrant population          As we have learned with misguided immigration policies in the past  it is na  ve to think that people who do not have a way to stay legally will just abide by the system and leave   They won   t   This new group of second class workers will replace the current group of undocumented immigrants  placing downward pressure on American wages and working conditions   And when their time is up  they will go into the shadows where our current system exploits the undocumented today         I will support amendments aimed at fixing the temporary worker program that Senator Bingaman and others will be offering   And if we   re going to have a new temporary worker program  those workers should have an opportunity to stay if they prove themselves capable          But the most disturbing aspect of this bill is the point system for future immigrants   As currently drafted  it does not reflect how much Americans value the family ties that bind people to their brothers and sisters or to their parents          As I understand it  a similar point system is used in Australia and Canada and is intended to attract immigrants who can help produce more goods   But we need to consider more than economics  we also need to consider our nation s unique history and values and what family based preferences are designed to accomplish   As currently structured  the points system gives no preference to an immigrant with a brother or sister or even a parent who is a United States citizen unless the immigrant meets some minimum and arbitrary threshold on education and skills          That   s wrong and fails to recognize the fundamental morality of uniting Americans with their family members   It also places a person   s job skills over his character and work ethic   How many of our forefathers would have measured up under this point system   How many would have been turned back at Ellis Island          I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator Menendez to remove that arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family starts to count and to bump up the points for family ties          And at the appropriate time  I will be offering another amendment with Senator Menendez  to sunset the points system in the bill   The proposed point system constitutes  at a minimum  a radical experiment in social engineering and a departure from our tradition of having family and employers invite immigrants to come   If we are going to allow this to go forward  then Congress should revisit the point system in five years to give us time to examine the concept in depth and determine whether its intended or unintended consequences are worth the cost of continuing the experiment or whether we should return to the existing system that allows immigrants to be sponsored through family and employers          In closing  we must construct a final product that has broad bipartisan support and will work   The time to fix our broken immigration system is now   If we do not fix it this year  I fear that divisions over the issue will only deepen and the challenge will grow
