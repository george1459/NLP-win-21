Calls on Blackwater to Testify Before Senate Monday  October 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Calls on Prince to testify  Release details of Iraq contract  WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  called on Chairman Joseph Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to ask Erik Prince  the head of Blackwater  to testify before the Committee and provide details of the company   s contract in Iraq  In February  Obama offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674   a comprehensive piece of legislation requiring more information and accountability on private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  The Senate passed an Obama amendment in the Defense Department Authorization bill that will require federal departments to compile and report information to Congress on the role of contractors in Iraq  Obama has also introduced a separate bill  S  2147  to require private contractors to be held accountable under federal law    Below is a copy of the letter  October 15  2007  The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman   The Honorable Susan Collins  Ranking Member  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs   Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins   As you know  on September 16  2007  personnel from Blackwater USA  a private security contracting firm  killed as many as 17 Iraqi civilians in an incident in Baghdad   This incident  which has damaged the United States    reputation in the eyes of the Iraqi people  has highlighted the need for more oversight of our government   s use of contractors in Iraq   I am writing to request that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hold hearings on the proper role of private security contractors  as well as the September 16 incident  Earlier this month  Erik Prince  the head of Blackwater  testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform   At that hearing  Chairman Waxman decided not to ask Mr  Prince specific questions about the September 16 incident out of deference to a pending FBI investigation   However  in two interviews broadcast yesterday  Mr  Prince provided a detailed accounting of what he believes happened that day  asserting that Blackwater guards were fired upon  despite evidence to the contrary  On CNN   s    Late Edition     Mr  Prince suggested that Blackwater   s actions are dictated by the State Department        W e send professionals over there to do a job we do  dictated by the U S  government  by the State Department who hires us   We recruit  vet  equip  train and deploy them  and then we turn them over to the operational control to the U S  government         T hey dictate the missions  they dictate the vehicles  they provide the weapons  they tell us where to go and what to do     Mr  Prince also said that he welcomed greater scrutiny of Blackwater   s operations   On CBS       60 Minutes     Mr  Prince said      We absolutely want more oversight   We welcome the accountability   We want a good name for this industry      Given Mr  Prince   s willingness to submit to additional oversight  as well as the importance of these issues to our ongoing effort in Iraq  I request that you invite Mr  Prince to testify before our Committee  Although the House Oversight Committee shed some light on Blackwater   s practices and the State Department   s relationship with Blackwater  there are still many issues involving Blackwater that merit further oversight   These issues include   the lack of transparency associated with the hiring and conduct of private security contractors  the lack of accountability over their actions  the State Department   s role in covering up previous incidents in which Blackwater guards shot at Iraqi civilians  and the impact of the contractors    behavior on our efforts to win hearts and minds in Iraq and Afghanistan   All of these issues  I believe  merit further investigation by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee    In preparation for such a hearing  I believe it would be prudent to request a copy of the contract that Blackwater received from the State Department to conduct its mission   According to press accounts  that contract was awarded without competition from multiple bidders   Moreover  there remain questions about the rules of engagement under which Blackwater contractors operate in Iraq  including a belief that State Department contractors operate under rules of engagement that are more permissive than those under which Defense Department contractors operate  Given the military   s increased reliance on such private security contractors  greater oversight from our Committee would be both timely and important to ensuring that we understand not just what mistakes have been made  but how we can correct them in a way that protects our national interest   I thank you in advance for your consideration of my request       Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator
