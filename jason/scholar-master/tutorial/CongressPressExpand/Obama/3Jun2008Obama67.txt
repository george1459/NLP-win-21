legislation   We should do everything we can to ensure that the American public can easily access and track how the Federal government does its business   said Senator Obama    Our government took an important step last year by launching USASpending gov and giving ordinary citizens an important tool to hold Washington accountable   While USASpending gov has had tremendous success  this new legislation will expand the public information available on the website and improve the quality of government financial data   I thank Senator Coburn and the many government watchdog groups who have worked with me on this issue  and I hope Congress will quickly pass this important legislation    In our system of government the best ethics reform has always been frequent elections and the ability of citizens to hold their elected officials accountable   This legislation will give the American people valuable new tools in that effort   I m proud to have worked with Senators McCain  Obama and Carper on this important legislation   Dr  Coburn said   I m pleased to have the opportunity to work once again with my Senate colleagues to improve the transparency of federal spending   This bill is a continuation of our efforts to give taxpayers the power to know exactly what their money is being spent on and to help us in our efforts to root out waste and fraud   This legislation makes it much easier to hold agencies  contractors and others who receive federal funding accountable for their activities and their performance   said Senator Carper  In April 2006  Obama and Coburn introduced the

maintained by the Office of Management and Budget   The President signed this legislation into law in September 2006 and USASpending gov was launched in December 2007    Today  USASpending gov tracks approximately  1 trillion in Federal grants  contracts  earmarks and loans  provides real time updates of data concerning Federal spending  gives users an opportunity to post comments and provide feedback  and displays spending data according to contractor  grantee  and congressional district  This Act would expand information on USASpending gov to include    A copy of each Federal contract in both PDF and searchable text format   Details about competitive bidding  the range of technically acceptable bids or proposals  and the profit incentives offered for each contract   The complete amount of money awarded  including any options to expand or extend under a contract  An indication if the Federal award is the result of an earmark  Information about government lease agreements and

about Federal tax compliance by Federal award recipients  Information about parent company ownership that will be made accessible  along with other data on USASpending GOV  through application programming interfaces  Links to publicly available Government reports    The Act would improve data quality on USASpending gov through    Improved searchability of data and use of unique award identifiers that prevent the release of sensitive personally identifiable information  A simple method for the public to report errors and track the performance of agencies in confirming or correcting the records for which error reports have been filed    Agency inspectors general review statistically representative samples of agency awards to verify accuracy and compliance with improved data
