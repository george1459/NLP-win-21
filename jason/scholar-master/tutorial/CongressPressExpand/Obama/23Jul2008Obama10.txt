   Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus Express Concerns Over Recent VA Promotion    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus Express Concerns Over Recent VA Promotion  Wednesday  July 23  2008  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Doctor who oversaw Marion VA facility chosen to oversee VA quality and safety WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  were joined by Congressmen Jerry Costello  D IL  and John Shimkus  R IL  in expressing concern over the recent appointment of Dr  Peter Almenoff   the former head of the regional network responsible for the Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Center in Marion  Illinois   as the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health and for Quality Safety    In a letter to Secretary of the VA  Dr  James Peake  the members of the Illinois Congressional delegation asked for an explanation of the VA s decision to promote Dr  Almenoff along with a full description of his new responsibilities   Additionally  they asked for any information the VA may have about his efforts to ensure high quality medical care at Marion as director of the VA Heartland Network   Dr  Peter Almenoff had oversight authority over the Marion VA Medical Center when nine lives were lost due to substandard care   said Durbin    Just last week  he was given a promotion expanding his authority over healthcare throughout the VA   Critical questions about Dr  Almenoff s role in overseeing the quality of care at Marion VA should have been answered before he was appointed to this new position    After last year s unacceptable tragedies and negligent administration of the Marion VA  it s deeply troubling that Secretary Peake would promote the individual apparently responsible for the mismanagement of the facility to lead the Department s health quality and safety efforts   said Senator Obama    There are too many unanswered questions about Dr  Almenoff s role in the mismanagement of Marion that it seems imprudent to move forward with this appointment without further explanation  Our veterans and service members deserve care worthy of their sacrifice  and they should not be put in danger   I look forward to Secretary Peake s prompt explanation    We have repeatedly emphasized that the VA needs to be very clear with the public about how it is proceeding to restore confidence in the Marion VAMC and the overall veterans  health system   said Costello    Given Dr  Almenoff s previous position  we need more information as to how his promotion best serves the VA and our veterans moving forward    Many veterans have lost confidence in the Marion VA Medical Center  and their trust must be earned back   Shimkus said   Promoting someone at this time who had been in the chain of command  such as Dr  Almenoff  sends the wrong message to those who have put their lives on the line for this nation   Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus have been closely monitoring the progress at the Marion VA Medical Center and the progress being made in hiring a new professional leadership team for the facility   Last month  in a meeting with the four Illinois lawmakers  Secretary Peake announced that a new leadership team will be put in place this fall at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion  Illinois      text of letter below and attached   July 23  2008   The Honorable James B  Peake  M D    Secretary of Veterans  Affairs  Department of Veterans  Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake  Last week  the Department of Veterans  Affairs announced that its quality and safety efforts will be led by an official with a questionable track record of ensuring quality and safety at a VA medical care facility in Illinois   Dr  Peter Almenoff  who will serve as the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Quality and Safety  formerly directed the VA Heartland Network responsible for the Marion VA Medical Center   As you know  at least nine veterans died in 2007 because of surgical incompetence at the Marion facility   The VA reviewed the facility after the deaths and found easily identifiable problems at Marion   We are not aware of any efforts by the network to fix these problems in the months before the spike in mortality levels   Indeed  the Department s reviews identified certain deficiencies with the network led by Dr  Almenoff  The role of the network in the failure of the Marion facility was never formally reviewed   Nor were network officials included in the Administrative Board of Investigation review   Instead  the VA has promoted the director  who should have been aware of the mismanagement at Marion    mismanagement that led to the deaths of veterans who had every right to trust that they would receive quality medical care  It is difficult to understand the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff   News of his promotion will be frustrating for the veterans who rely on the Marion medical center  particularly since quality and safety issues were at the forefront of the facility s troubles   It may also be of concern to veterans nationally  as Dr  Almenoff presumably will be responsible for quality and safety issues for the entire VA   You have promised to visit Marion and meet with concerned individuals there  and we are sure you will be asked during your visit about the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff  We would appreciate an explanation for the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff and a full description of his new responsibilities  along with any information the VA may have about his efforts as director of the Heartland Network to ensure high quality medical care at Marion  Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic
