   Obama  Ellsworth Hail Passage of Bill to Require Federal Contractors to Pay Taxes   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama  Ellsworth Hail Passage of Bill to Require Federal Contractors to Pay Taxes Wednesday  December 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  Obama  or Liz Farrar  Ellsworth    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Brad Ellsworth  D IN  today praised Congress    passage of their proposal to withhold federal contracts from companies and grantees that have not paid their federal taxes   This provision was included in the Omnibus Appropriations package  H R  2764   which the President is expected to sign into law  According to studies by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   thousands of federal agency contractors owe billions of dollars in unpaid taxes  This provision will withhold large federal contracts from businesses and organizations that failed to file tax returns and were delinquent on payroll taxes for a significant period of time   Obama first introduced this proposal as an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill  and it was also attached in the Senate to bills funding military construction and the Departments of Defense  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development  Transportation  Veterans Affairs  Commerce  Justice  and State   Ellsworth originally introduced the Federal Contractor Accountability Act  H R  1986  in the House of Representatives in April 2007    Today  Obama and Ellsworth introduced legislation     the Contracting and Tax Accountability Act     to make the fix permanent for all federal spending on contracts and grants     Companies that fail to pay their taxes are not responsible enough to be contractors with the federal government     said Senator Obama     Millions of hard working Americans don   t get a free pass if they don   t pay their taxes  and neither should corporate interests   This provision will ensure that corporations that receive taxpayer funding play by the rules  and it will increase transparency and accountability over how our money is spent        It   s wrong for government contractors who owe millions in unpaid taxes to pad their bottom lines with taxpayer dollars  Not only do these bad actors cheat our government of tax revenue  they gain an unfair advantage over businesses that play by the rules     said Ellsworth     I am proud to work with Senator Obama in pushing this practical and cost effective way to ensure all companies compete on an equal playing field and our tax dollars are being used wisely     In numerous studies  the GAO found that thousands of General Services Administration  GSA  contractors maintained tax debts totaling over  3 billion  Many of these businesses failed to forward payroll taxes withheld from their employees and other taxes to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   Failure to submit payroll taxes is a felony under the law  Moreover  some companies even redirected payroll taxes for personal gain  These companies were contractors for numerous federal agencies  Federal law does not require federal agencies to adequately consider tax debts in making contracting decisions  In fact  current law prohibits the disclosure of taxpayer data  which means there is no mechanism for contracting officers to access the IRS   s tax data when conducting their review of prospective contractors   While the government requires agencies to consider various criteria  including financial resources  business ethics  and integrity  a contractor with seriously delinquent tax debt is not disqualified from receiving federal funds   Without a systematic review process  the federal government ultimately continues to award lucrative contracts to companies with significant tax debt  This provision will withhold federal contracts and grants over  5 million from tax delinquent businesses and organizations in fiscal year 2008                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
