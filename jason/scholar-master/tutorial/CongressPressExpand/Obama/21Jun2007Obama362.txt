               Feingold  Obama Push for Strongest Ethics and Lobbying Reform Bill Possible Thursday  June 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact   Zach Lowe or Ben LaBolt                                                                                   Architects of Ethics and Lobbying Reform Bill Urge Senate Leaders to Maintain Provisions That Will Lead to Real Change in Way Washington Works  Washington  D C      U S  Senators Russ Feingold  D WI  and Barack Obama  D IL  are pushing for Congress to produce the strongest ethics and lobby reform bill possible   Feingold and Obama are urging several Senate leaders  who will play important roles in the bill   s fate as the Senate prepares to negotiate the final bill with the House of Representatives  to include several key provisions that passed the Senate but were left out of the House version of the bill   Feingold and Obama were two of the main architects of the Senate bill which passed in January with broad bipartisan support   Senate Majority Leader Reid hailed the bill as one of the most significant pieces of legislation dealing with ethics and lobbying reform in our nation   s history   Also signing the letter were all of the freshmen Democratic Senators including Senators Brown  D OH   Cardin  D MD   Casey  D PA   Klobuchar  D MN   McCaskill  D MO   Sanders  I VT   Tester  D MT   Webb  D VA   and Whitehouse  D RI   who made cleaning up Washington crucial parts of their successful campaigns       The public voted for change last November in part because people were sick and tired of the way Washington works     Feingold said      Without provisions like a strong lobbyist gift ban  and tough restrictions on privately funded travel and corporate jet flights  the bill won   t do enough to change the status quo in Washington          Last November  the American people sent a message to Washington to clean up its act  so it   s important that Congress take tough action on lobbying and ethics reform     said Senator Obama      Since donors are now limited in the amount of money they can contribute to candidates  the greatest measure of influence is how much an individual raises   The final ethics bill must require that candidates disclose those who have bundled contributions for their campaigns  so that we can expose the link between lobbyists who are raising campaign cash in exchange for votes on legislation and start changing the way Washington works        The text of the letter reads     June 21  2007 The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  The Honorable Mitch McConnell  Minority Leader The Honorable Dianne Feinstein  Chairman  Committee on Rules and Administration  The Honorable Robert Bennett  Ranking Member  Committee on Rules and Administration The Honorable Joseph Lieberman  Chairman  Committee on Homeland Security   Government Affairs  The Honorable Susan Collins  Ranking Member  Committee on Homeland Security   Government Affairs Dear Senators Reid  McConnell  Feinstein  Bennett  Lieberman  and Collins   At the beginning of the 110th Congress  the Senate worked diligently in a bipartisan fashion to pass a strong lobbying and ethics reform bill aimed at changing the culture of political Washington   That bill  known as S  1  included several provisions that we view as vital   We urge you to ensure that the Senate conferees on S  1 champion these Senate passed provisions and seek to include them in the final bill brought back to the Senate floor   In particular  we believe that the following provisions must be included in the final bill if the Congress is to fulfill its promise to deliver to the American people a lobbying and ethics reform measure that constitutes real reform and will lead to real change   A strong lobbyist gift ban     The Senate bill includes a modification to the Senate Rules to prohibit lobbyists and organizations that employ or retain lobbyists from giving gifts  including free meals and tickets  to members of Congress and their staffs   This provision must not be weakened   Restrictions on corporate jet flights     The Senate bill requires Senators to pay the charter rate when flying on corporate jets for personal  campaign  or official purposes   All components of this provision must be retained   The changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act included in the Senate bill  but not the House bill  are essential so that incumbents and challengers in congressional races are treated equally   Disclosure of political contributions and bundling by lobbyists     With gifts banned  the Senate bill requires disclosure of the various ways that lobbyists can legally provide financial assistance to elected officials   This includes contributions to campaign committees  lawmaker   s charities or entities designated by a lawmaker  Presidential libraries  inaugural committees  and events to honor or educate elected officials   To make sure the public has a complete picture of the financial ties between legislators and lobbyists  the provision requiring disclosure of participation in fundraising events and of contributions collected or arranged for lawmakers must also be included   Revolving door amendments     Current revolving door restrictions have proven ineffective in preventing members of Congress from profiting on their public service and gaining undue lobbying access to their former colleagues   The Senate bill increases the    cooling off period    for members of Congress from one year to two years    By contrast  the House bill does not change the current cooling off period    The Senate bill also expands the activities that former members must refrain from during that period   Finally  senior staff are prohibited for one year from making lobbying contacts with the entire house of Congress for which they worked  instead of just the employing office   All three of these components are important to restoring public confidence in Congress and should be included in the conference report   Limits on privately funded travel     Following the lead of the House  which significantly changed its travel rules in January  the Senate bill includes provisions designed to ensure that lobbyists and organizations that employ lobbyists do not pay for multi day trips that the public often sees as boondoggles   The Senate bill permits legitimate educational trips paid for by groups that do not lobby and one day trips to give speeches or attend events related to official business   Elaborate trips were central to the Jack Abramoff scandal  and these new rules must not be weakened in conference   Lavish convention parties     The Senate bill contains a rule change that prohibits Senators from attending events held in their honor and paid for by lobbyists or entities that employ or retain lobbyists at the national party conventions   These events have come to symbolize both the excess and the access of some lobbyist lawmaker relationships   This provision should be included in the conference report   Greater transparency in the legislative process     The Senate bill contains a number of provisions to open the legislative process to greater public scrutiny and understanding  including ending the practice of secret Senate holds  making conference reports available on the Internet at least 48 hours before voting on them  providing a 60 vote point of order against conference report items outside the scope of the conference  prohibiting    dead of night    additions to conference reports  and earmark reforms   These provisions must be retained in the final bill   We believe that a strong lobbying and ethics reform bill can help change the way politics is conducted and policy is pursued in Washington  thereby increasing public confidence in Congress   The Senate   s work in January gave the public hope that real reform could actually occur on a bipartisan basis   We strongly urge you to make sure that those hopes aren   t dashed in this last stage of the legislative process   We look forward to working with you to pass a final bill of which the Senate  and the public  can be proud   Sincerely     Russ Feingold  D WI   Barack Obama  D
