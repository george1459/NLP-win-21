   Obama  Harkin  Raising Renewable Fuel Standard Boosts Our Rural Economy   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Harkin  Raising Renewable Fuel Standard Boosts Our Rural Economy Friday  October 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Kate Cyrul  HARKIN    Bill will ensure market keeps pace with ethanol boom  Builds bridge to next generation of biofuels    WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  yesterday introduced a bill to immediately update the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  to require the production of 18 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2016 including 3 billion gallons of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol   The legislation will implement the RFS requirements that were included in the energy bill passed by the Senate in June   However  negotiations between Senate and House on competing energy bills have stalled  and the new RFS has yet to take effect   Obama and Harkin s bill recognizes the need for prompt action to update these renewable fuel requirements to provide market certainty to small  local  and farmer owned ethanol producers      Despite a boom in production of ethanol by small plants across the country  most consumers around the country have been unable to fill up their cars and trucks with E85 gasoline because of problems in the distribution of ethanol and obstacles to greater ethanol distribution by oil companies   The average spot market price for ethanol has dropped 30 percent over the past six months   With ethanol prices dropping this severely  according to the New York Times   there is likely to be a sweeping consolidation of the industry  and some small companies could go out of business      Without the market stability provided by an increased RFS  many small ethanol plants would face increasing financial danger that could cause them to fail  which would not only jeopardize an important bridge to the next generation of cellulosic fuels  but also hurt farmers  small ethanol producers  and the rural economy as a whole      Those family farmers and local ethanol producers have set an example for how to embrace new technologies to lessen our dependence on foreign oil  and they ve in turn strengthened the rural economy   Senator Obama said    I ve listened to local producers and heard first hand how the dive in ethanol prices is having real  day to day effects on their livelihood  We need to ensure that Washington is giving them a fair shot to compete against the big oil companies that have dominated this industry  kept us dependent on foreign oil  and compromised our environment   We are at a critical time in the history of our renewable fuels industry  and we need to fix the imbalance in the market that s working against locally owned plants   If we are serious about creating clean  renewable sources of energy  we need to support the creation of a domestic biofuels industry that will take us from corn ethanol to cellulosic ethanol    It won t happen if these ethanol plants go out of business because ethanol prices continue to fall and Washington insiders continue to block much needed reforms   I thank Senator Harkin for his longstanding leadership on this issue       We need to increase domestic production of clean  renewable biofuels for national energy security   said Senator Harkin    While the backbone of that industry has been  and continues to be ethanol from corn  we know we need to develop and commercialize biofuels made from cellulosic feedstocks as well   Our farm bill will support that advanced biofuels development   In the meantime  we also need to ensure steadily expanding markets for biofuels  markets that currently are being pinched by limited product distribution channels and consumer access   This new standard is precisely the bridge required to support the steadily expanding use of biofuels to replace more of the gasoline powering the vehicles on our highways      The need for an updated RFS is clear   Currently  ethanol production is booming     but the energy industry is not keeping up   Less than one percent of the nation s 179 000 gas stations  which are franchised from major petroleum companies  offer E 85   Two percent of the nation s 230 million cars are capable of burning E85 ethanol  and American automakers are poised to make half their fleets E85 capable in the next five years     but await the oil industry to allow consumer access to these fuels      A higher RFS was also part of The Biofuels Security Act  legislation introduced on the first day of the new Congress in January  by Senators Obama  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  and Dorgan
