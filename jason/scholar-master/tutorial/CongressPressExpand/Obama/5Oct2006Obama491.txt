                                                     Senators Criticize Bush Administration   s Failure to Monitor Communications of Deadly Terrorists in U S  Custody Wednesday  October  4  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor  202  228 5511  Reid Contact  Jim Manley or Rebecca Kirszner  202  224 2939  Date  October 4  2006  Senators Criticize Bush Administration   s Failure to Monitor Communications of Deadly Terrorists in U S  Custody   WASHINGTON     In a letter to President Bush  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D NV  and Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today said that the Administration   s failure to monitor the communications of deadly terrorists already in U S  captivity calls into question the ability of this Administration to conduct the intelligence operations required to effectively fight terrorism    In a report released yesterday  the Department of Justice Inspector General  IG  Glenn Fine concluded that    the  Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high risk inmates on its monitoring lists is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism  criminal activities  or other inappropriate behavior     As a result  according to the IG report     the threat remains that terrorist and other high risk inmates can use mail and verbal communications to conduct terrorist or criminal activities while incarcerated       In their letter  the Senators said     The failure to monitor the communications of these deadly terrorists already in captivity calls into question the Bush Administration   s ability to wage an effective war on terror and competently conduct intelligence operations that are crucial to keeping our nation safe       The Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  is supposed to carefully screen 100  of mail sent and received by high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists  When the mail is in a foreign language  the BOP is expected to have the mail reviewed and translated by someone fluent in that language   The BOP is also supposed to monitor verbal communications of convicted terrorists over the telephone  in visiting rooms  and in the cellblock     But the report found that these communications are rarely if ever monitored  and that BOP officials are lacking the resources and training required to do their jobs    Some of the most troubling conclusion in the report include   The BOP did not hire any full time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005     four years after the 9 11 attacks   At one federal prison  only 0 3  of mail for all inmates was randomly screened by BOP staff   At one federal prison  the three FBI agents responsible for terrorism matters were not even aware that there were two inmates at the prison who were incarcerated for international terrorism crimes     Below please find the full text of the letter    October 4  2006   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear President Bush     We are writing to express our serious concerns about your Administration   s failure to monitor all mail to and from convicted terrorists in federal prisons   Your Administration   s disregard for this basic surveillance obligation leaves our nation at grave risk    As you know  the Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  is supposed to carefully screen 100  of mail sent and received by high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists   When the mail is in a foreign language  the BOP is expected to have the mail reviewed and translated by someone fluent in that language   The BOP is also supposed to monitor the verbal communications of convicted terrorists over the telephone  in visiting rooms  and in the cellblock     These screening requirements are intended to address the real threat posed by terrorists in our prisons   For instance  in March 2005  news reports indicated that three convicted terrorists at the federal penitentiary in Florence  Colorado  who were imprisoned for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center had written approximately 90 letters to Islamic extremists between 2002 and 2004   Some of these letters were written to members of a Spanish terror cell with links to terrorists suspected in the March 2004  train bombings in Madrid    However  in a report released yesterday  the Department of Justice Inspector General  IG  Glenn Fine concluded that    the BOP has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high risk inmates on its monitoring lists is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism  criminal activities  or other inappropriate behavior      As a result  according to the IG report     the threat remains that terrorist and other high risk inmates can use mail and verbal communications to conduct terrorist or criminal activities while incarcerated        The failure to monitor the communications of these deadly terrorists already in captivity calls into question your ability to wage an effective war on terror and competently conduct intelligence operations that are crucial to keeping our nation safe    Among the report   s findings are the following    At 7 of the 10 prisons surveyed by the IG  the amount of mail involving convicted terrorists that was monitored has decreased since FY 2005 because of BOP cost cutting initiatives   At one federal prison  only 0 3  of mail for all inmates was randomly screened by BOP staff    The BOP did not hire any full time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005     four years after the 9 11 attacks     The first group of Arabic language specialists hired by BOP received no counterterrorism intelligence training during their first year of employment that would help them analyze the mail they were reading    At one prison  only 3 out of 1 385  0 2   of calls involving high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists  were monitored during the month of August 2005   The prison also housed organized crime figure John Gotti  Jr   who was awaiting trial for kidnapping and racketeering  and none of his 50 phone calls during that month were monitored    The BOP did not audio record the social visits of terrorist inmates  and according to the IG report     the BOP may be missing opportunities to detect terrorist or criminal activity       There is wide variation in the amount of information shared between the BOP and FBI regarding terrorist inmates   At one federal prison  the three FBI agents responsible for terrorism matters were not even aware that there were two inmates who were incarcerated for international terrorism crimes   The prison staff at another facility learned from a news article  rather than the FBI  that an international terrorist housed at their prison was a high ranking member of al Qaeda and had trained to be a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden    We urge you to take immediate action to ensure that the Bureau of Prisons remedies this serious security failure   In the War on Terror  there is no excuse for any agency to allow terrorist activity in its midst   The Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons must stop convicted terrorists from engaging in terrorist communications    We ask that you respond by October 13  2006  as to the steps that you are taking to address this problem   Thank you    Sincerely    Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  Senator Barack Obama
