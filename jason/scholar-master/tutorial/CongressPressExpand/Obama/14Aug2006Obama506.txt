WASHINGTON   In the wake of reports that four no bid contracts for Gulf Coast reconstruction have ballooned from  400 million to  3 4 billion  U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  Monday sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison asking him explain what efforts have been made to stop the use of no bid contracts  how these contracts were allowed to balloon  and what  if any  additional authority the agency needs to permanently stop these abuses     We cannot express to you in strong enough terms how serious this issue is to us and our Senate colleagues  On four separate occasions over the past year  the Senate has unanimously approved amendments to limit the use of non competitive procedures in contracting   the Senators wrote   Competition is good for American business  and it s good for the government  It helps to ensure high quality and low costs  Competition is what the American people have a right to expect  and that s what we intend to achieve     Obama and Coburn said that in both private meetings and public testimony  Director Paulison has expressed concerns about the use of no bid contracts and promised that FEMA would employ non competitive procedures rarely and only when absolutely necessary to avoid unacceptable disruption to critical services  But despite these repeated assurances  news reports indicate that no bid contracts are still being awarded  The four contractors who won no bid contracts to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees have seen the value of the contracts balloon from  400 million to about  3 4 billion  and these contractors were awarded another  1 billion in potential contracts last week from FEMA     Given your strong statements in opposition to no bid contracts  we were greatly troubled to learn that FEMA is continuing to extend these contracts to the point that their value is now more than eight times the original contract value   the Senators wrote   Since we are nearing the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  we question whether any emergency remains that would justify a continued reliance on no bid procedures     Below please find the full text of Obama and Coburn s letter       August 14  2006    The Honorable R  David Paulison  Director  Federal Emergency Management Agency  500 C Street S W   Washington  D C  20472 Dear Mr  Paulison  We are writing to express our grave concern about the contracting practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  that were highlighted August 9th in the Washington Post   According to the Post  four no bid contracts awarded to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees have ballooned in value from  400 million to about  3 4 billion    In private meetings with us on December 15  2005 and May 17  2006  you expressed similar concerns about the use of no bid contracts and promised that FEMA would employ non competitive procedures rarely and only when absolutely necessary to avoid unacceptable disruption to critical services     You also have made similar public statements to our Senate colleagues   In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6  2005  you stated  I ve been a public servant for a long time  and I ve never been a fan of no bid contracts   Sometimes you have to do them because of the expediency of getting things done   And I can assure that you we are going to look at all of those contracts very carefully   All of those no bid contracts  we are going to go back and re bid  Given your strong statements in opposition to no bid contracts  we were greatly troubled to learn that FEMA is continuing to extend these contracts to the point that their value is now more than eight times the original contract value   Since we are nearing the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  we question whether any emergency remains that would justify a continued reliance on no bid procedures  Indeed  just last week  we learned that the four contractors   Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw   who received the original no bid contracts were awarded new contracts to provide temporary housing   Each of these new awards has a contract ceiling of  250 million   And while the congressional advisory announcing the awards indicates that these contracts were awarded  through a full and open process   concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the competitive process  We cannot express to you in strong enough terms how serious this issue is to us and our Senate colleagues   On four separate occasions over the past year  the Senate has unanimously approved amendments to limit the use of non competitive procedures in contracting  The American people deserve the benefits of competition in government contracts   Competition is good for American business  and it s good for the government   It helps to ensure high quality and low costs   Competition is what the American people have a right to expect  and that s what we intend to achieve   In order for us to assess whether additional Senate action is necessary  we request that you respond to the following questions by August 31  2006 What efforts  if any  have you made to stop the use of no bid procedures  What procedures were used for the latest  250 million contracts awarded to Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw  What  if any  additional resources or authority do you need to stop the use of no bid procedures      Sincerely  Tom Coburn  M D   United States Senator Barack Obama                                                                           United States Senator
