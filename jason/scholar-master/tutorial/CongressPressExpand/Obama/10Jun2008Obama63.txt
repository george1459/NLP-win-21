   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Senate Bills to Cut Energy Costs   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Senate Bills to Cut Energy Costs Tuesday  June 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement following the Senate s votes on the Consumer First Energy Act  S  3044  and the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act  H R  6049    Both measures were blocked today       Today  Senate Republicans turned a blind eye to the plight of America s working families and our nation s worsening dependence on foreign oil   At a time when Americans are struggling with skyrocketing energy prices  including paying over  4 00 a gallon for gasoline  Senate Republicans blocked debate on important legislation that would have provided tax relief for low income families and spurred on investments in job creating research and development and alternative energy     Senate Republicans also refused to extend critical investments in renewable energy  such as solar  wind  and cellulosic ethanol   I am particularly disappointed that the tax credit for the installation of biofuels pumps at gas stations  a provision I helped enact in 2005  is among the provisions that were blocked     These proposals alone would not have solved our serious energy problems  but they would have provided American families with some much needed relief from record high gas prices   They also would have put America on track to having real alternatives to foreign oil and helped make our economy less vulnerable   We must stand with American families and not with those that are taking advantage of them  and I am committed to working with my colleagues to pass these important measures                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
