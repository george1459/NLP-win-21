   Obama Renews Support for Embryonic Stem Cell Research   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Renews Support for Embryonic Stem Cell Research Wednesday  April 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Says proposed alternatives are not substitutes WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement during the debate on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  I stand in full support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act as I did when this bill was introduced and sent to the President   s desk in the 109th Congress   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill   I am frustrated by the opposition this bill has generated and saddened that we are preventing the advancement of important science that could potentially impact millions of suffering Americans   The study of stem cells holds enormous promise for the treatment of debilitating and life threatening diseases   However  in order to reach this level of medical achievement  much more research is necessary to understand  and eventually harness  the amazing potential of stem cells   Instead of creating roadblocks  we must all work together to expand federal funding of stem cell research and continue moving forward in our fight against disease by advancing our knowledge through science and medicine   Each year  100 000 Americans will develop Alzheimer   s disease  with impaired memory  ability to understand  and judgment    Over 1 million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year  and risk complications that include blindness  damaged nerves and loss of kidney function   We all know or have met individuals with spinal cord injuries  including national celebrities  local war heroes and loved ones from our own families and circles of friends  who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence   For most of our history  medicine has offered little hope of recovery to the 100 million individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries   Until now   Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments  if not cures  for those affected by Alzheimer s disease  diabetes  spinal cord injury and countless other conditions   Many men  women  and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the life saving applications of adult stem cell research   Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants  a type of stem cell transplant  which can significantly prolong life  or permanently get rid of the cancer   This therapy has been used successfully for decades  and is saving lives everyday   Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations  Adult stem cells  such as those used in bone marrow transplants  can only be collected in small quantities  may not be a match for the patient  which can lead to rejection  and have limited ability to differentiate  or transform into specialized cells   Similarly  the promising advances of stem cell use from a patient   s own cord blood  as illustrated by the success stories of Dr  Joanne Kurtzberg from Duke University  also have their limitations   If  for example  a young cord blood recipient   s condition should deteriorate after his or her initial treatment  or should develop another illness  there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use    The few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future treatment  or stem cells would have to be obtained from another source   Two of my constituents  Mary Schneider and her son Ryan  are well aware of the potential of cord blood treatments   Her son  diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 2 years of age  has made what appears to be a full recovery after treatment with his own cord blood   Despite the compelling results witnessed by the Schneider family  they also firmly believe and support expanded research of embryonic stem cells to combat disease   A recent scientific paper about stem cells derived from amniotic fluid has drawn much attention   While this offers an exciting alternative to regenerative medicine therapies  the author of that report  Dr  Anthony Atala  has himself urged that his work on amniotic stem cells will not replace the continued need for investigation into treatments with stem cells derived from embryos   All of these alternative treatments are just that  alternatives  and are not substitutes for embryonic stem cell research   Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources  including in vitro fertilization   At this very moment  there are over 400 000 embryos being stored in over 400 facilities throughout the United States  The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples  However  many of these embryos will go unused  destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal    We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos  just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use  cord blood use  and amniotic fluid use   The promise of embryonic stem cells has come to light in a recent achievement by researchers at Johns Hopkins   They were able to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats through embryonic stem cells   One can   t help but wonder when  not if  this research will be translated into techniques that will help human patients who have lost the ability to walk   Of course any work in this area must have appropriate oversight  Embryonic stem cell research demands comprehensive  thoughtful and carefully crafted ethical and scientific guidelines  We must not only look to guidance from the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration but also to our reason  our morals and our compassion   The President   s veto of the stem cell bill proposed in the last Congress prevents government funding beyond 78 previously established stem cell lines   However  recent estimates on the number of viable cell lines bring the numbers down closer to 20   Clearly  we are moving backwards in our efforts with these current restrictions   Stymieing embryonic stem cell research is a step in the wrong direction   It closes the door on many Americans awaiting new treatments that could potentially provide a better quality of life  or  perhaps  even save their life   My hope  and the hope of so many in this country  is to provide our researchers with the means to explore the uses of embryonic stem cells so that we can begin to turn the tide on the devastating diseases affecting our nation and the world
