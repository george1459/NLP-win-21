  Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants Thursday  March 30  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Durbin Contact  Sandra Abrevaya   202  224 7115    Date  March 30  2006  Illinois and New Jersey Senators Introduce Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants Two Plants in Chicago Area Could Threaten More than 1 million People   CHICAGO   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Durbin  D IL   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and Bob Menendez  D NJ  today introduced legislation to drastically improve security at our nation s chemical plants     There may be no greater failure of our government than the fact that we have done almost nothing to secure one of America s most vulnerable targets   the 15 000 chemical plants in America   said Obama   These chemical plants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists looking to cause widespread death and destruction  Despite this  security at our chemical plants is voluntary   left to the individual plant owners  While many chemical plant owners have taken steps to beef up security  too many have not  In Illinois  there have been recent reports by ABC 7 in Chicago of chemical plants with dilapidated fences  insufficient guard forces  and unprotected tanks of hazardous chemicals  These plants are basically stationary weapons of mass destruction  Their security is light  their facilities are easily entered  and their contents are deadly      Chemical plant security is a serious problem and the combination of lax security and deadly chemicals is a toxic mix   said Durbin    Illinois has more facilities that store extremely hazardous materials then any other state  with over 100 000 pounds of hazardous substances stored in over 600 facilities   It is unacceptable that we have chemical plant facilities in our state and in other parts of this country that anyone can stroll onto   This bill puts a lock on the door and real fencing in the yard     There are 111 facilities in the United States where a worst case scenario attack on a chemical plant could threaten more than one million people  according to the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Two of these facilities are within Chicago s city limits  Illinois has at least 11 facilities where a large scale chemical release could threaten more than a million people    The Chemical Safety and Security Act of 2006 would replace current weak voluntary chemical plant security standards with a clear set of federal regulations that all plants must abide by  Plants that are considered a high risk to large population areas or critical infrastructure would face more stringent standards    Plant owners and employees would work together to tailor their security plans to address each individual facility s vulnerabilities  but they would face tough penalties for noncompliance  The bill would also protect the right of states to establish security standards that fit local needs so that states like New Jersey that have been leaders in chemical security do not see their current laws weakened    The bill addresses all methods to reduce risk  including physical security such as security forces  perimeter defenses  hazard mitigation and emergency response  But the bill also requires the use of safer technologies to reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a target  This concept  known as Inherently Safer Technology  involves methods such as changing the flow of chemical processes to avoid dangerous chemical byproducts  reducing the pressures or temperatures of chemical reactions to minimize the risk of explosions  reducing inventories of dangerous chemicals and replacing dangerous chemicals with benign ones  Each one of these methods reduces the danger that chemical plants pose to our communities and makes them less appealing targets for terrorists     Safety regulations can be implemented in a way that is flexible enough for the industry yet stringent enough to protect the American people   Senator Obama said   It is long past time to put the security of our nation ahead of special interests or politics   Now is the time to act to protect our citizens      This is a comprehensive bill that will satisfy the need for tighter security at chemical plants with a minimum of disruption for chemical manufacturers   said Durbin    It not only increases onsite security  it calls for stricter rules on chemical production and protects employees who expose security risks   We need tough  enforceable standards for chemical plant security and this bill will move us much closer to that goal     Lautenberg Obama  The Chemical Security and Safety Act  Establishes General Duty to Improve Security at Facilities Storing Threshold Amounts of Chemicals  Requires chemical facilities to take steps to improve security  including improving barriers  containment and mitigation  safety training  and  where possible  use safer technology   Known as  Inherently Safer Technology   or IST  includes using less toxic chemicals and employing safer procedures   Identifies High Priority Chemical Facilities  Directs the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to work with the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   as well as state and local agencies  to identify  high priority  chemical facilities that would receive priority oversight   Prioritization would be based on the threat posed to public health and safety due to proximity to population centers  type and amount of chemicals involved  and threats to national security and critical infrastructure    Requires High Priority Facilities to Conduct Vulnerability Assessments and Develop and Implement Response Plans  Directs DHS to work with EPA  as well as with state and local agencies  to establish regulations to require each high priority facility to do the following   Conduct a vulnerability hazard assessment  Develop a prevention  preparedness and response plan that incorporates the assessment results  and includes actions to reduce vulnerabilities by improving security measures and  where possible  uses safer technology   In developing the plans  facility operators must consult with facility employees and local first responders  Participate in periodic scheduled and unscheduled site visits and inspections to assure compliance with security plans and other requirements  Establish safety and security advisory committees at each facility that includes employees and managers  Conduct drills to practice prevention  preparedness and response plans   Provide employees with security training every year   The bill would establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate best practices for risk assessment  security planning  and the use of Inherently Safer Technology   Protects State Laws  Protects state and local government s right to establish chemical security and safety requirements more stringent than national standards   Protects Whistleblowers  Protects employees who report dangerous gaps in security to the Department of Homeland Security   Protects Sensitive Information  Protects security information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other state or local disclosure laws    Inherently Safer Technology  IST   Widely Accepted   The concept of Inherently Safer Technology  IST  was developed in 1977 by chemical industry insiders who were seeking innovative ways to reduce risk     The Department of Homeland Security s July 2004 draft Chemical Sector Specific Plan states that inherently safer chemistry and engineering practices can prevent or delay a terrorist incident  noting that it is important to make sure that facility owners and operators consider alternate ways to reduce risk  such as inherently safer design  implementing just in time manufacturing  or replacing high risk chemicals with safer alternatives    The Department of Justice recognized the value of IST in introducing a methodology to assess chemical facilities  vulnerabilities in 2002    New Jersey requires chemical facilities to review the practicability of adopting inherently safer technology in its 2005 chemical security law    Industry uses IST in its volunteer security standards   The American Chemistry Council s  Responsible Care R  Security Code of Management Practices  requires that chemical sources take  into account inherently safer approaches to process design  in implementing security measures   Options to Reduce Risk  Alternative reaction routes or plant layout  the sequence of reactions in the process may reduce or eliminate a hazardous exposure   For example  in producing the insecticide Carbaryl  one can change the sequence of steps in the reactions process so that the potentially dangerous methyl isocyanate is eliminated as an intermediate product   Simplification  eliminate unnecessary complexity so workers can comprehend the process and recognize hazardous circumstances   Energy limitation  the energy potential   whether electrical  chemical or kinetic   is reduced in order to reduce the hazard of an exposure   For example  reducing temperature or pressure in reactions can reduce potentials for explosions   Substitution  safer materials or processes are substituted for more hazardous substances or processes   For example  substituting an inherently toxic substance for one that is biologically benign   Intensification or minimization  avoid the catastrophic potential of an exposure by storing small amounts of a substance   For example  storing less volume of flammable chemicals   Economically Viable   A recent study by an MIT Professor published in the journal Safety Science identified more than two dozen feasible inherent safety alternatives   The majority of those options were shown to have payback times of less than two years  Overall  25 percent of the options were implemented during the study   Examples from across the Country  In Washington  DC  the Blue Plains Sewage Plant switched from volatile chlorine gas to less volatile sodium hypochlorite bleach  which has far less potential for airborne off site impact   In Cheshire  Ohio  American Electric Power selected a urea based pollution control system rather than one involving large scale storage of ammonia that would have endangered the surrounding community   In Cuyahoga County  Ohio  ALCOA reduced its potential off site impact by working with local emergency planners and ending on site storage of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid   There are 148 gasoline refineries in the country   Fifty of them use hydrogen fluoride to increase the octane  Hydrogen fluoride is highly toxic  If released into the air  the liquid turns into a heavy  low lying gas  In the last ten years  many refineries have switched to safer alternatives like sulfuric acid or modified hydrogen fluoride that does not turn into a gas   Shifting Risk Rather than Eliminating Risk   There are few examples where shifting technologies appears safer  but actually increases risk  For example  at times  the only viable replacement for a toxic chemical is one that is more flammable or that risks public health   These examples are a minority and can be managed when IST is reviewed on a facility by facility basis and balanced against increases in overall threat
