   Obama Asks President to Ensure National Guard Has Resources Necessary to Respond to Domestic Emergencies   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Asks President to Ensure National Guard Has Resources Necessary to Respond to Domestic Emergencies Tuesday  May  8  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt    Equipment has been depleted as units are deployed overseas WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush requesting that he ensure that the National Guard has the resources necessary to respond to domestic emergencies and disasters  The text of the letter is below  Dear President Bush  I   m troubled by reports that our emergency response capabilities continue to be hampered because National Guard resources have been diverted overseas   The Guard provides our first defense against disasters that strike on our soil   In light of the tragic events in Greensburg  Kansas  I   m writing to ask you that the federal government ensure that the National Guard has the resources necessary to respond to disasters here at home   In my home state of Illinois  the Air National Guard reports shortages of trucks  earth movers  and other equipment critical to emergency response   According to the Government Accountability Office  the Illinois National Guard only has 45 6  of its dual use equipment on hand   That   s under half of what we need to dam the Mississippi if it overflows   That   s under half of what we need to respond to deadly tornadoes   That   s under half of what we need to evacuate wounded civilians from an attack   Our National Guard should never be overstretched to the point where we allow our homeland security and emergency response capabilities to erode   We must provide our troops with all of the resources they need to perform their missions overseas  but we must also ensure that civilians at home are protected from natural disasters and security threats   Governor Sebelius was right to question the diversion of the Guard   s resources and personnel overseas   There   s no question that this has undercut our emergency preparedness and our homeland security   While the Emergency Management Assistance Compact allows states to cooperate in times of emergency  you know that during a disaster  time equals lives  and the extra time needed to mobilize outside assistance cannot compare with the effectiveness of having people and equipment positioned and ready to respond to a disaster   Your administration should make available all aid necessary to help the residents of Greensburg recover from the tragedy that leveled their homes   The National Governors Association has requested budget authority to reequip Army and Air National Guard units returning from overseas missions     and that authority should be granted    We cannot afford to learn a lesson about unmet needs each time a disaster strikes   The National Guard is the essential mechanism through which states prepare for and respond to emergencies   If your administration chooses to divert state resources to assist the military overseas  this gap should be filled in order to protect Americans at home
