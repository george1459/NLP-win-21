introduce Admiral Daniel L  Cooper   He is the VA Undersecretary for Benefits   Admirable Cooper        Applause from the audience    MODERATOR PONCE   And the Honorable Richard J  Griffin   He is the Inspector General for the VA   Mr  Griffin        Applause from the audience    MODERATOR PONCE   And it is now my pleasure to introduce Senator Richard Durbin        Applause from the audience    SENATOR DURBIN   My thanks to Phil Ponce  to Wright College and Secretary Nicholson     First  let me thank the veterans   Once again  we are gathering together to honor what you have given to America  to make certain that it goes beyond the speeches of Memorial Day and the speeches you will hear at the campaigns to show our commitment to you by what we do  rather than what we say     Thank you for what you gave to this country  and what you continue to give  and we ll continue to stand by you and make sure that you re treated fairly   Thank you so much for being here today     Let me say to Secretary Nicholson  thank you   Thank you for keeping your word for coming to Chicago  as you promised Senator Obama and me several months ago to meet with the veterans of the Chicagoland area to talk about the challenges we face     Secretary Nicholson  it wasn t your leadership that brought us to this point today  but it is your leadership that can lead us from this point forward to make certain that we treat veterans fairly in every region of the country  certainly in the area of Chicago     Let me also say about those who work for the Veterans Administration   There are many conscientious  hard working  good people working for the VA at the hospitals  at the clinics  at the offices   We salute them   We thank them   If there is room for improvement  we want to work with them to make certain that the VA continues to be an agency that serves our veterans so well     So now a thanks to their report of the Inspector General  we come together today armed with the facts  armed with information  and the information that has been given to us unfortunately is disappointing     Too many times Illinois vets were denied disability claims and compensation unfairly not one year  not for five years  but for 20 years Illinois ranked dead last in the United States of America compensating its victims   We can talk about demographics and trends  but it won t explain the fact that we were last in the nation 20 straight years     There is more to the story   And when you look closely at the IG s report  you can see it   If a veteran came in to pursue a claim and didn t bring a VSO or an attorney with him  he was likely to receive maybe only half of what he was entitled to   We also know that the worst experience dealt with claims where there was some subjective judgment   It wasn t an amputation   It was a question of how much of a loss   In those cases  IG s report tells us there was a wide disparity     For posttraumatic stress disorder  100 percent  it turns out in New Mexico  you were five times more likely to receive it than the State of Illinois   When it comes to individual unemployability  it turns out if you were in one of the high states that the IG s report analyzed  you were three times more likely to receive it than in the states of the low states  like Illinois     The conclusion for decades   Illinois veterans pursuing a claim without an attorney came up with a about half of what they were entitled to  and if the claim involved a subjective decision  they may have received as little at 20 cents on the dollar compared to other states     Let me see    we have to also take a look at the Chicago Regional Office   The report of our veterans on that Regional Office is a call for leadership and a call for change in that office        Applause from the audience    SENATOR DURBIN   We have to make certain that the veterans coming to that office do not leave disappointed  feeling that they didn t receive a timely  fair  prompt and thorough decision     I think things are getting better   The report indicates they are   But we can improve even more  and we have to strive to do that     Secondly  we have to make sure that when it comes to resources  we provide them   When you do a survey across America and have almost 2 000 people working in VA office surveyed  and two thirds of them say there just aren t enough people working here to keep up with the case load to treat the veterans fairly  that is a call to arms not just for the Secretary  but for members of Congress to appropriate the money to put it in the Veterans Administration system     Let me close by saying this          Applause from the audience      SENATOR DURBIN   Let me close by saying this   We need to make sure that we don t fight a war on the cheap  and we ve got to make certain that we don t serve our veterans on the cheap   We have to say to veterans  soldiers of today and the young men and women we are trying to recruit that we will stand behind you     When it comes to posttraumatic stress disorder  we have to acknowledge the obvious   There is a wave of challenges coming at us   We haven t dealt with this issue as seriously and completely as we should have     I thank you for gathering today  for adding your voices in this meeting to tell us what our challenge will be   I thank you for your leadership and making America safer   And now let s work together to make veterans across Illinois fairly compensated and respected for what they gave to our country          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you  Senator Durbin   And now it is my pleasure to introduce Senator Barack Obama        Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   Thank you so much   Thank you  everybody   It is wonderful to see this great turnout   Many of you participated in some Town Hall meetings that we had when I was first elected  and one of my first priorities was obtaining a seat on the Veterans Committee  because as I traveled across the state  the thing I consistently saw was that our best and our brightest  having fought for in wars  having provided that enormous devotion to their country were coming back and feeling neglected  feeling mistreated  feeling ignored     And the thing that I pledged when I was sworn in as the Senator was that if nothing else in the first couple of years in the Senate  I could make absolutely certain that there would have been a strong advocate in the United States Senate          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   It so happened  it so happened that as I was joining the Veterans Committee  that a story broke in the Sun Times indicating that there was a huge discrepancy between disability payments for Illinois veterans relative to veterans in other states   These were not small discrepancies   We re talking about discrepancies on the magnitude of  5 000   And immediately we requested  Senator Durbin and myself  meeting with Secretary Nicholson  to not only find out why this had occurred  but more importantly how we were going to solve it     I am grateful for Secretary Nicholson on following through on his pledge to come and report directly to Illinois veterans   And I am grateful to the IG s office for conducting their report in a timely fashion   But the purpose of the meeting today is not only to go over what has happened in the past  it is to make absolutely certain that it never happens again          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   That s going to be our top priority   I just want to    I have a visual here  just to underscore what Senator Durbin talked about   This is a chart that was included in the report  Review of State Variances in VA Disability Compensation Payments   This is contained in the report prepared by the IG     The first year  1985  go back all the way up to 2000   If you look from 1985 to 2004  Illinois ranks 50th every single year  each and every year   It is not 49 some years  it is not 42nd some years  it is every single year it is number 50     Now  as Senator Durbin indicated  it appears that there have been some improvements in terms of new claims   If you were lucky enough to file your claim in the last year or the last two years or the last three years  then it appears based on the report prepared by the IG that you have a good likelihood of doing relatively well if you re an Illinois veteran     But one of the critical issues that I think  Mr  Secretary  we re going to need to talk about today is what happens to all the veterans who filed their claims during this 20 year period          Applause from the audience      SENATOR OBAMA   How can we make them whole   I know based on some of the statements that were made yesterday that the Veterans Administration has as a matter of policy the ability of every veteran to appeal their claims   But from my perspective  at least  and I think Senator Durbin shares this view  it is not sufficient to say to veterans who may have been shortchanged for 20 years  well  you can go through the same process all over again  wait for the same number of years as you went through before  and potentially get the same results     It strikes me that there should be some way to expedite and review what happened during this 20 year period in order to make certain that people are treated fairly  and they don t have to wait     Let me just close by saying this  because we want to leave sufficient time for the Secretary and for your questions   If you look structurally at what is happening in the Office here in Chicago and in Illinois  what is clear is that despite the fine work of many officers who are working within Veterans Affairs  they are understaffed  they are not able to produce timely and accurate reports  they are not able to do the job that needs to be done on behalf of veterans     Now  the President issued the budget in which he said we don t need more money for the VA   And you know  as Senator Durbin said  this is not something that you caused   You just came in   And so I m not holding you responsible for what has happened in the past  but my understanding at least was  and you testified before my Committee  I was sitting there  that we have adequate resources to meet the challenges     I guess my point is that if we ve got the majority of your own employees indicating that we are not sufficiently staffed in order to provide timely service to these veterans  then it seems to me that we ve got to come up with the resources to make sure that we fix that system          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   If we don t  if we don t  then what I fear will happen is that we will have some nice words at this meeting today  but three years  four years when the cameras aren t here and the newspapers aren t around  we start slipping back into the same situation that we have had for the last two decades  and that s what I want to prevent     So I hope that there is going to be in your responses some structural issues that are addressed in terms of how we can improve what happens in Chicago  what happens in Illinois  to make certain that our veterans  who have done such great service for all of us  that we are repaying the debt that we owe each and everyone of them     Thank you very much  everybody          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you  Senator   Thank you  Senator Obama     Our next speaker grew up on a tenant farm in Iowa   He is one of seven children   He is a 1961 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point   He served eight years on active duty as a paratrooper and Ranger qualified Army Officer   He served 22 years in the Army Reserve  and retired as a Colonel   While serving in Vietnam  he earned the Bronze Star Medal  Combat Infantryman Badge  the Meritorious Service Medal  the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry and two Air Medals     Please join me in welcoming the Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs          Applause from the audience     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Good afternoon  everyone   Thank you for this opportunity of being here   I want to thank particularly Senator Durbin  Senator Obama for inviting me to come and giving me the opportunity to be here with you and to be heard   I want to send my greetings to the Lieutenant Governor of the State  Mr  Quinn  and I also want to thank the many colleagues that I have here from the VA     I was very happy to get this invitation to come here  and doubly happy that our Inspector General really accelerated his place so that we could have his report  his study completed  and informed so that we could make it public  which we will do here today with copies for you  if you want to take one with you     Just before coming here today  it was my pleasure to be out at the Hines VA Hospital campus where we dedicated a new spinal cord injury clinic and a new blind rehabilitation center out there  which so far as I know  the first tangible results of our new CARES or asset realignment process in the VA where we re trying to have VA services the closest and most convenient that we can to where the veterans are     A lot of facilities were built during or just after the war   We ve had great demographic shifts since then  and some facilities need to be closed  others need to be expanded  like we ve just done  which we were able to do because we consolidated some other facilities     For nearly 75 years  I say nearly  in July  it will be 75 years  that s our 75th Birthday   The Department of Veterans Affairs has honored this nation s commitment to our veterans   It is a commitment rooted in the values that we Americans place on those of you who have worn our nation s uniform     I have a special perspective on this  because four months ago  I was an Ambassador in Italy at the Vatican when I was asked to come back to take this job   And the other ambassadors from all over the world said what is it you re going to do  you are going to be a minister  as they say in new government   What will you do   I said if confirmed by the Senate  I will be the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs     None of them knew what I was talking about   They had a vacuous look on their face   There is no other country in the world that has something like we have in our VA  and it speaks to the value that we have for the veterans     This Town Hall communicates yet another important message I think   There is a question concerning the process by which the VA has provided  and continues to provide benefits and services to our veterans   And this has come to the light of day here and we are addressing it     Late last year  when press reports questioned the fairness of our claims process  the Inspector General  who is an independent agency of our Department  was asked by my predecessor to do a system wide review of our claims and benefits process to see what problems there are or might be   After all  our long standing commitment is that every veteran s claim will be treated fairly and equitably no matter where that veteran might live     As many of you know  the Inspector General released his report yesterday  along with eight recommendations   They are good recommendations I think  and we are taking them seriously  and we are taking them on board  and we re going to take action     In fact  seated at this table right down here to the right of Senator Durbin is our VA Inspector General  Richard Griffin  who has come here today to answer questions on his report if so appropriate     Seated right beside him is a gentleman that has already been introduced  that s the Undersecretary for Benefits for the VA  Admiral Dan Cooper   His charge to me is to make sure that those recommendations become reality     And let me conclude by saying something as clearly and sincerely as I can   We are committed to doing what is right for our veterans   If that entails that we have to set up a special operation here in Illinois to review your claims or to look at new claims that you as an eligible veteran want to make  we will do that   We want each of you to feel that you have been treated fairly and equitably by your VA  because you deserve that     The past is past  but as I have been charged by both of these Senators  the future is now  and we are going to make a special effort to see if we can have you feel sure that you have been treated fairly and equitably by the VA so that you will have a chance if you so choose to have a review of that  or you can bring the new information to us  and we will make every effort to see that that is reviewed  and reviewed fairly and equitably for you     Thank you          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you  Mr  Secretary     At this point I will be reading questions from the audience  and when I read the question  I am going to read the name of the person who submitted the question  and I would invite you to stand or raise your hand as your question is being answered     The first question comes from John Donnegan of Chicago  U S  Army   The question is for Secretary Nicholson   Mr  Donnegan  would you care to indicate where you are     MR  DONNEGAN   Right here     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   And the question is for Secretary   Why does a veteran need representation in order to get benefits     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Can you hear me   Is it working     Well  the short answer is that you don t   But the veteran service organizations  American Legion  VFW  et cetera  have people that are trained  and they can make available to become advocates for a veteran in filling out a claim  and so it is up to the veteran about whether or not he or she wants to make use of these veteran service representative organizations    SENATOR OBAMA   Can I just make a comment on that   The    Secretary Nicholson is correct that it is not required  but and perhaps the Inspector General wants to comment on this as well   This study shows that those who use VSO advocates tend to receive substantially higher benefits than those who do not     So my first piece of advice to everybody  every veteran here  work with your VSO  because it makes a difference          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   If I m not mistaken  Mr  Secretary or Inspector General  the difference is as much as  1 700    SENATOR DURBIN   62    SENATOR OBAMA   Excuse me    6 200 if you use one of these advocates as opposed to when you didn t   And I think that part of my understanding in terms of some of the variables that create discrepancies between states is that some states have higher utilization of these VSOs than others do   Is that correct     MR  GRIFFIN   If I may  we have placed 300 copies of the executive summary of our report on a table in the hallway so that you could pick the report up  take a look at it   If you have questions that don t get addressed today that you would like to ask me about  please call us   The entire report  which is 200 pages  is available on our website  which is identified inside the cover     Just a point of clarification about how these different numbers are over the years   The first numbers that triggered the local interest in the payments that we received in Illinois represented the average payment that was the result of ratings done in Illinois for the past 60 years  and it was an average payment   So if you had a rating done in 1946  and it hasn t changed  your rating is part of that average     What we did is we looked at more current data  because to go back to  45 and  46  first of all  we didn t have time to do that  and secondly  we wanted to see what has been happening lately     And in looking at the data for the last six years  for the first half of fiscal year  05  the Chicago office ranks fifth in the country for new and reopened claims  just so you are aware of that     As far as the 6 225 goes  that number came from our examination of the 60 years worth of data   The  1 700 that the Senator referred to initially refers to the delta for ratings done in 2004   So it has shrunk  perhaps it has shrunk because of legislation that created Duty to Assist by VBA   And the fact is that if you are strapped from a human resources standpoint  if you have VSOs who are familiar with the system  who can work in support of the VBA employees   SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Say what VBA is    MR  GRIFFIN   I m sorry   Veterans Benefits Administration   That s like a fourth multiplier for them  and they also know how it is done  and that results in these higher numbers    MODERATOR PONCE   The next question comes from Tom Brophy  U S  Army from Oswego   Mr  Brophy  if you care to stand or indicate   MR  BROPHY   Here you go   MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   This is his question is for the Secretary  and the question is   Considering that half of the reasons for Illinois  low ranking deal with demographics that can t be changed  how do you account for Illinois raising average benefits in the last two years  aside from rater subjectivity   Mr  Secretary     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I think that s a real good question  and the technical expertise that we have here resides in Undersecretary for Benefits and the IG who did this research study   So I will ask first for Admiral Cooper to respond  and then if you have anything to add  please do  Mr  Griffin     ADMIRAL COOPER   I would say the major factors are the changes that we started making three years ago   Four years ago the Secretary of the VA asked that a study be done  and I was asked to chair that study   I came in and got some very knowledgeable people  and realized that across VA  we were doing things in disparate ways  each RO was operating differently   And so as a result  we set up some very specific rules as to how it is organized  how the IT applications are done  how the processes are set up   We then set up better specialized training   We also set up very specific oversight from Headquarters where I have people who will go out and visit the regional offices to make sure they re doing much better     So I think everybody was raised   I also think that the Regional Office Director that went in about the year 2000 and other people that we have put in there who are very talented have helped to a great degree     MODERATOR PONCE   The next question was submitted without a name   The question is   It is my understanding that it takes 300 days to certify an appeal   What are you doing to reduce the backlog   Mr  Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I don t know if it is 300  and Admirable Cooper can respond to that more specifically  but the appeals do take time   They re appealed initially to the Board of Veterans Appeals  which is an independent  quasi independent board that reviews the decision of our claim adjudicator  and they will typically ask for more data from the hospitals and from the doctors that made the examination  and they may need to see more things from the veteran s record     And so there is  there is pervasive time  a drag in there  if you will  where that data has to be gotten where those reviews have to be accomplished     I will ask Admiral Cooper if he has anything he would like to add    ADMIRAL COOPER   First I would like to say that yes  it is 300 days to date   Two years ago  it was 400 some days   That is not much relief  but that at least explains that we are trying to make progress     Secondly  I would say to you this   Veterans Claims Assistance Act that came into effect in late 2001 laid down very specific time requirements  and one of those is whenever we send you a letter and say we need some information  you have at least 60 days to answer that letter   And every time we find a new fact and we need to get new information from you or ask for an explanation  that is another 60 days that is allowed   So let me say the time is too long   We re working very hard on it     The final point I would make to you is we are today getting about 800 000 claims a year into the VBA   So all those things are factors   They are too long   We re working on it very hard     MODERATOR PONCE   Senator Durbin    SENATOR DURBIN   If I could just follow up on that   It was an excellent question  and here is some information that I would like to ask the Secretary or Admiral or someone to respond to     Currently it takes the Chicago VA office 206 days from receipt of a claim until final decision   That s 39 days more than the national average of 167 days   We ve also learned that the office  Chicago office sends almost one out of four claims  23 percent  to Cleveland  St  Louis  Muskogee  Oklahoma  or Milwaukee to be processed     We also find out that when it comes to appeals  that in this situation  Chicago had 56 percent of its appeals cases kicked back for more information last year   This year so far  182 cases out of 376  almost half decided by the Board of Veterans Appeals  have been remanded back to the Chicago VA for more documents   It takes two years to reach the point where it is remanded   It can be doubled that time once it is sent back     So I think what this tells us is  and what you just said  we need more people   We need more people processing these claims          Applause from the audience     SENATOR DURBIN   And I    I know having worked in Washington for a while and members and delegates  and I think Senator Obama raised the fact  but I have to ask you  Mr  Secretary  how can we make good on our promise to do a timely review of these claims and appeals without more people to get the job done     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   That s a fair question and fair comment   If  if we need more people in this office  I think we ve added some already  we will add them     But let me just point out  because there is    in this appeals process  as Admiral Cooper just said  there are statutory time plugs in there of 60 days every time something new is needed from you  you have 60 days to respond     So I would say if you come in and we re working with you  give your information back to us just as quickly as you can     AUDIENCE MEMBER   How is that going to get more people     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   If we need more people here  we re going to get them   And as I said when I spoke earlier  this is a    it looks like  you know  we could make a special effort for you to come in and have a review or come in with a new claim  and we re going to have people there to process it and do it just as timely as we can     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Are you going to get more people     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I would    I would say yes  we are  because it is           Applause from the audience    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   We re probably going to need      MODERATOR PONCE   The next question comes from Mr  John Piciolo   He is from Lockport  Illinois  and Mr  Piciolo  would you like to raise your hand or stand  sir     He has a two part question   Do the proposed funding levels for  06 reflect the anticipated need of vets returning from Iraq  number one     And number two  will vets currently in the system have benefits reduced to accommodate the new vets   Mr  Secretary     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Good question   The answer is yes   The budget that has been submitted by the President to the Congress is a record budget   The VA budgets have gone up 47 percent in the last four years   This record is a record budget if its approved at that level  and it anticipates our needs of our returning heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan     And as to the second part of your question  sir  by having them being a priority in our treatment will not diminish the care that we give to our existing veterans     SENATOR OBAMA   Mr  Piciolo  I just want to comment   You know  the Secretary presented the President s budget  and you know  I have utmost respect for the Secretary being here  being willing to talk to the veterans directly  but I do have to say that the initial budget presented by the President  if I m not mistaken  called for a one half of one percent increase over previous years  not sufficient to cover the anticipated return of the significant number of Iraqi and Afghani troops     Senator Durbin has done some terrific work documenting the incidents of posttraumatic stress disorder that in previous years often times went undiagnosed   If we re doing our job well  it will be diagnosed this time   All that seems to point to a need for significant additional resources if we re not going to have a situation in which either the timetables get stretched out further for claims  or the amount of time that it takes for veterans to receive services is prolonged     And so I guess I m just wondering  just if you can amplify a little bit on the question  are you currently reviewing next year s budget to accommodate for this growth from what we anticipate to be more veterans coming into the system     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   You re talking about the  06     SENATOR OBAMA   The  06 budget    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Yes  we are looking at that   That s a dynamic process  and it is     AUDIENCE MEMBER   What about the  100 billion to treat illegal immigrants    SENATOR OBAMA   Hold on a second    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   We are    I also want to point out  Senator  is that in that budget  we do have  100 million requested increases for PTSD  research and frequency    SENATOR OBAMA   Okay    MODERATOR PONCE   The next question is from George Fraser   Mr  Fraser  if you care to stand or raise your hand   The question is   Hines doctors are very good  as well as assistants  but delays in treatment and mistakes with paperwork and determinations are the norm     Secretary Nicholson  would you please respond to this observation     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Well  if they re making mistakes or delays  I m sorry to hear that   I will tell you that I ve been in this job now almost four months and have visited many of our hospitals  including Hines today  and I m extremely proud as an American and as a veteran and as a Secretary of the job of what the people are doing at our hospitals  I have been extremely impressed     And even more importantly than what I think of them probably is what third party evaluators do   And recently we had an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine that said the VA Integrated Health Delivery System is the best there is   It said that about the VA   And I can brag about that  because I didn t make it that way  but I m very proud and grateful that it is     Is it perfect  probably not   But the staff that I have met in these hospitals  most of whom can make more money elsewhere  work there  and the common denominator in their response to me when I say how can we keep you  how do we keep you at the VA  they said I get to take care of veterans   So they really believe in what they re doing     If there is a chronic case of mistakes or delays  I would like to know more about it individually  because I m sure we can correct that     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Why is there no nurse s aides on the second and third shift at Hines   Nurses have to          Inaudible comment made in the      audience      MODERATOR PONCE   The question was  and then we will stick to the cards  the question has to do with why there are no nurses on the second or third floor     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Nurse s aides    MODERATOR PONCE   The nurses have to take care of everyone   AUDIENCE MEMBER   On the second and third shifts  nurses that are on shifts now have no one else to help them   They cover all of the things that happen on the ward     MODERATOR PONCE   So the question is      AUDIENCE MEMBER   They have to take care of all the patients  if there is any kind of accidents  if they soil their beds  if they soil the floor  they have to come and take care of it   When you ring your buzzer and ask why  you have some need for yourself  you are lucky if someone comes within an hour     Before  it used to be  and even three or four years ago  if you would ring that buzzer and somebody would be there within ten minutes   MODERATOR PONCE   All right   Let s get a response to that  and then we will stick with the cards   Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I m not able to respond to this in the detail  but I will  if we get your name and so forth  I will find out and get you an answer     MODERATOR PONCE   I am reminded that there are specific health officials here in the lobby area who can respond to specific kinds of concerns  so if you have any more questions along those lines  there are people to respond to your questions     The next question comes from Ben Dock Wagner   Mr  Wagner  if you want to raise your hand     MR  WAGNER   Right here   MODERATOR PONCE   The question is according to the error rate for 2003  why are 27 percent of disability claims in Illinois decided incorrectly     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Do you have a response to that Admiral     ADMIRAL COOPER   I will merely say that we are continuing to look at it  we continually look at it   And the report I have as of three days ago that the error rate is about 10 to 11 percent  which is still not good enough     I don t know the 27 percent of three years ago   I know we have tried to work very hard and beat people down to get these thing right     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Could I get a mike over here     MODERATOR PONCE   Real quickly  yes  sir   And sir  I would say if you have a follow up question  get to the question so we can get to other questions too  please   Thank you   AUDIENCE MEMBER   My follow up question would be another question     MODERATOR PONCE   Go ahead   AUDIENCE MEMBER   The VA is telling me  what I know about this  I have been involved with    as an Airmen officer  and they are telling us  they say a severed leg is worth more in Montana than it is in Illinois  and it just doesn t make sense          Applause from the audience     AUDIENCE MEMBER   I will give you one example   I have a friend in Texas  who was at the same battle of the Chosen as I was   My buddy that was in the Battle of the Chosen Reservoir lives in Texas   We have the same 85 percent disability from frostbite where we lost part of our toes and our ears  and he    I get  1 400 less a month than he does     One more point   On my  1 400  I m supposed to be getting 2 250  and I m retired  and they take it out of my Navy retirement  and we fought that   President Bush did sign a law to drop concurrent receipt  and the VA turned around  and here is what they did  boys and girls  they phased it over a ten year period   I will be dead and buried before I ever get my money   Thank you very much          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Mr  Secretary  before we answer that  we are going to be sticking to the cards after that  because I would like to get to those of you who submitted the cards   Unfortunately we are going to have to have to limit the impromptu questions from the audience  as legitimate as they are     Mr  Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   First of all  thank you for your service   I will tell you that the loss of a limb is the same everywhere     AUDIENCE MEMBER   No  it isn t   Cost more to live in Texas    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I m going to refer to our Inspector General  if he wants to elaborate a bit on that answer  and then I can take up or have one of our people talk to you individually   I have people here that they will be here all day and into the evening for those of you who want to talk with them about your specific case  sir     AUDIENCE MEMBER   All right   Thanks a lot          Inaudible comments made from the      audience      MODERATOR PONCE   Excuse me   We really have to take the cards    MR  GRIFFIN   May I respond to that     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   MR  GRIFFIN   In the course of our review  we reviewed 270 000 cases involving below the knee amputation  above the knee amputation    can I just   These are real examples  just so you have the benefit of the information  and deafness  and we checked by diagnostic code for those things   Because it was suggested during the course of our review that a below the knee amputee in Chicago ought to get the same money as a below the knee amputee in another part of the country     So we specifically pulled that data  and for the 270 000 cases that we looked it that four categories  we had about a 99 percent consistency rating   The ones that were not consistent  we referred to VBA     And we re finding out some of them  the reason they were different than the assigned rating is that they had a secondary condition that caused them to get more     I would think  as the Secretary said  I would take your case to the Regional Office people here and have them review it          Inaudible comments made by the      audience      SENATOR OBAMA   Sir    AUDIENCE MEMBER   I have been there many times    SENATOR OBAMA   Mr  Inspector General  this might be a good time to amplify for the veterans the point that seems to be made in the report  that is  if there is inconsistencies when it is an identifiable physical disability  but it does appear that there are huge discrepancies when it comes to ailments like posttraumatic stress disorder  in which some states are receiving significantly higher than others     Part of the concern  Senator Durbin and I spoke yesterday and talked to your assistant  was that our understanding  and maybe you can explain this to me  is that the criteria by which you evaluate and rate these disabilities was first designed in the 1940s when my grandfather  a WW II vet was first leaving Patton s Army  and it strikes me that there has been a lot of medical advances since that time   We have a lot more information about the difficulties that many veterans face     I m wondering what systematic steps we can start taking to update that system to start achieving more consistency across states     MR  GRIFFIN   As indicated in our report  using the disability such as PTSD  which involves obviously mental conditions  which are not easily measured  there is a wide discrepancy or variance depending on where you re located   Some of that variance may be due to the fact that the stressor event to which the PTSD benefit is tied is not present  and therefore  it brings into question that rating     Let me say this   We reviewed 2 100 PTSD files in seven different regional offices   We looked at two in what we call the high cluster in states that had the highest average payment  and we looked at two at the bottom  and we looked at three in the middle   In looking at those cases  my audit staff used the protocol that Veterans Benefits Administration has in their manual for rating PTSD cases     In the cases we reviewed  in two of those seven regional offices  one office had a 40 percent error rate  and I defined that by saying that when we looked in that case file  there was nothing in the file that would support the stressor event that their claim was tied to   That s a problem     And Admiral Cooper has agreed that they will take a second look at those   Another office was at 36 7 percent   Illinois was at 21 7 percent of the PTS    of the 300 files we looked at here  where we couldn t locate in the file what the stressor event was     So it is a problem   There is variance   It needs some work   It is 45 year old rating schedule   It doesn t reflect the technology of today  or the employment opportunities of today   Because right after World War II  there are different opportunities today  and although the schedule and the system has been increased over the years  it needs to be given a thorough going over     If you have never seen that rating schedule  it is about the size of the Chicago yellow pages   The raters have been trying to go through that sometimes with only very general terms to describe the condition  such as mild  moderate  severe  pronounced   It doesn t give them a lot of help to try and determine which of those ratings is most appropriate    SENATOR DURBIN   I would like to say one word on this   I want to say a word about this posttraumatic stress disorder  and I want to salute Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn on this   We ve been working together   I think this is a huge growing problem that we re going to face in the Veterans Administration          Applause from the audience     SENATOR DURBIN   I just    we have had  Lieutenant Governor Quinn and I had have town meetings where vets coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan   You Vietnam vets know what I m talking about   If they don t get a helping hand quickly  things can go down fast in their lives     Mr  Inspector General  when I read the summary  page seven  here is what you write  talking about 100 percent disability related to PTSD  and here is what you write     For example  New Mexico has the highest payment average of  12 004  and 12 6 of its veterans are in this group   Illinois has the lowest average payment of  6 961  and only 2 8 percent of its compensation recipients are rated 100 percent     So it is not only the fact that almost five times as many veterans are receiving compensation for this problem in New Mexico  the payment that they re receiving is almost twice as much          Applause from the audience     SENATOR DURBIN   So if you could    could you address that particular issue   This goes beyond subjectivity as I see it  if I read your figures correctly    MR  GRIFFIN   New Mexico is one of the states that we reviewed PTSD cases in   We had a problem with 35 percent of the 300 cases we reviewed   Again  we used the same protocol in all seven offices   When we finished  we sat down with the three Regional Office directors at all seven locations  and although as you would expect  there was some push back on some of the cases that we challenged   More than half of them they agreed on  and in one office they agreed with 94 percent of our conclusions     You are right   It is a growing problem   It is a real condition   Please don t misunderstand   I know that   I also know  though  that at the end of fiscal year 1998  VBA was paying  1 7 billion a year for posttraumatic stress compensation   And at the end of fiscal year 2004  they re paying  4 3 billion   So it has gone up 2 6 billion     And you should know that the cases that my people reviewed  and we just review them and report what we find  we reviewed the cases in Illinois   Illinois was one of the regional offices we came to  and the fact is we had on average 25 percent over the seven locations that were not supported by a stressor event in the file     So it has grown   No question   There are other denominators that are attached to it   We found that upon achieving 100 percent ratings  39 percent of the 92 that we looked at for this circumstance ceased coming in for mental health treatment   They continued to come to the VA for other treatment  but 39 percent of them  their mental health treatments went away by 82 percent  and some of them never came back     So we have to realistically look at this and determine  you know  what s going on  and I think that s what is going to happen     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Part of those are 18 000 homeless guys    MODERATOR PONCE   Our next    excuse me   Excuse me   We need to move on  because time is limited     Our next question  Mr  Secretary  comes from David Rogers   Mr  Rogers  would you care to    Mr  Rogers     The question is  Mr  Secretary  what can you do  what will you do to bring emergency relief to homeless and disenfranchised vets          Applause from the audience     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   That s a very important question  and we are working on that diligently   In fact  I was here in Chicago  now I think maybe it has been four weeks ago  to break ground for a 131 bed shelter facility in conjunction with the Archdiocese of Chicago and Catholic Charities on the old St  Leo parish in South Chicago   That s going to be a beautiful facility  and we  the VA are going to co position a community based outpatient clinic right there with it  and a vocational rehabilitation training facility   So we ve made a major commitment to that     This is a big problem for our country   There are we think over 300 000 homeless veterans in America  and as far as I m concerned  there shouldn t be any   And we  the President  the President has thrown down a gauntlet when he came into office that in ten years  we want to end chronic homelessness for veterans  and we are making strives towards that     I chair the Intergovernmental Task Force on Housing with some other cabinet officers   We have a meeting coming up I think the week after next   It is a priority of the government  and we need to do these public private partnerships with faith based organizations  lever all we can so that we can  number one  find facilities for our homeless veterans  and then two  do the therapeutic programs that it takes to help them break barriers  their addictions  their chronic conditions  and give them hope and self value so we could get them back to being the productive people that they once were          Inaudible comment from the      audience      AUDIENCE MEMBER   I have not had the biggest snow job  inaudible    Thank God I met you in Skokie at the Lithuanian American Post   I ve got two letters  one for you and one for Senator Durbin and Senator Obama  because I know something will be taken care of   These are for you   SENATOR DURBIN   One of my staff people  Christina  if she s still around     MODERATOR PONCE   This is a question from Katie Boisie of Chatham  Illinois   Ms  Boisie  would you care to stand     The question is to Senator Obama   Senator Obama  what opportunities are there for personnel returning from OIF to support the veterans  especially those injured or needing further assistance     I m not sure  could you explain what the OIF is     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Operation Iraqi Freedom   MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   SENATOR OBAMA   Well  you know  I think this is a wonderful question  and that is how can we utilize our veterans to help veterans  because I know that in some of the Town Hall meetings that we ve had  a lot of times there is an emphasis on fact that there aren t enough veterans working in VA  that particularly when it comes to some of the homeless issues that I think Secretary Nicholson sincerely wants to deal with it  it is much more effective if somebody who has been in the field is reaching out and can relate to some of the issues that some of these folks are going through     So I don t have clear answers right now in terms of what those opportunities are  but I would love to talk to you and other individuals that are interested  and one of the things that we might be able to do is set up some organizational structures or institutions here in the State working with the VSOs  working with the VA  to potentially do some of work   And it sounds like there may already be some systems that are in place  Secretary   Are you aware of      SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Yeah    SENATOR OBAMA      some mechanisms that we can plug in for persons like this young woman     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Yeah   I would like to amplify that  because that is a very important question   In fact  you know  I am the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  and I consider it almost anything it affects a veteran  an affair of the veteran  and employment is certainly one of them     I have learned that among our age cohort of veterans of 20 to 24 years old  20 3 percent of them are unemployed   That s five times the national unemployment rate   That s unacceptable   These are people who signed up  did the training  performed their job in the military  got an honorable discharge  and one of five of them are unemployed     So I m taking steps   I have had a meeting now with people from the Department of Labor   I have gotten into the National Governors Association to commit to us that we are going have a big conference in Washington next month to develop a program to reach out to employers through the governors  through the major trade associations  and have them make an extra effort to find our veterans and to hire them   One  because they make great employees  and they ve gone through all of this stuff I ve told you  and two  because they deserve it   And if we can forge this linkage  I think we can make great strives in employing our veterans   Thank you     SENATOR OBAMA   Ms  Boise  I will have my staff get in touch with you after the meeting so we can make sure we get your contact information    MODERATOR PONCE   I m afraid this is going to have to be the last question   You know  I wish we had more time     This is from Andre Carter of Chicago  and the question   Mr  Secretary  what is going to come out of this meeting     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I m glad you asked that question   Where is he   Because that s    I was hoping I would have a chance to summarize what is going to come out of this  because we are making ourselves available starting right now   Where are your people     AUDIENCE MEMBER   In the lobby    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   People are in that lobby now   If you want now to go and leave your name  social security number  talk to them  whatever you want to do today  they will stay there until the last person leaves   We are going to make a special mobilization commitment to review those of you that want to be reviewed   If you have new information  new claims that you want to make  we are going to make an extra effort to serve you here in      MODERATOR PONCE   Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   In Illinois   Thank you very much    MODERATOR PONCE   And I understand the Secretary is on a very tight schedule  but Senator Obama  Senator Durbin  we have very brief closing statements   SENATOR OBAMA   First  the only thing I want to say is I am so grateful to all the veterans for the great questions   They were all on point   Give yourselves a round of applause        Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   For those of you who are interested in staying and talking to our staff or the VA staff  just make sure myself and Senator Durbin will be around a little bit longer to talk to you and respond to some of your questions more directly     SENATOR DURBIN   I just want to say thank you   I also want to thank the Secretary   It wasn t easy for him to take these questions   He did it   You hold us accountable   We will hold him accountable  and we are all accountable to you   Let s make sure the veterans end up the winners   MODERATOR PONCE   As the meeting is breaking up real quickly  I would like to note some people who have not previously been           Inaudible remarks made by      Moderator Ponce  due to the      audience leaving      STATE OF ILLINOIS           SS   COUNTY OF DuPAGE       Lisa M  Grau  being
