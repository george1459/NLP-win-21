   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on HELP Committee Hearing on the WARN Act s 20th Anniversary   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on HELP Committee Hearing on the WARN Act s 20th Anniversary Tuesday  May 20  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today submitted the following testimony to the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on Plant Closings  Workers  Rights and the WARN Act s 20th Anniversary   I started my career on the south side of Chicago trying to help people in communities devastated by steel plant closings get back on their feet   One of the things I learned early on  and have seen over and over again  is that American workers who have committed themselves to their employers expect in return to be treated with a modicum of respect and fairness   Failing to give workers fair warning of an upcoming plant closing ignores their need to prepare for the transition and deprives their community of the opportunity to help prevent the closing   I know that you have heard the frustration of workers who are let go by email the day before a plant closes or are told when they come to work that their services are no longer necessary   Many of these workers support families that are living from pay check to pay check  squeezed by the demands of rising health care costs  the declining value of their homes  and wages that have been stagnant for decades   It adds insult to injury to close a plant without warning employees   There may be no stronger advocate for these workers than Senator Brown  and I thank you for holding this hearing and authoring legislation to strengthen the Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification Act  WARN    I fully support your efforts and look forward to helping you move the legislation through the process   We must give the WARN Act teeth to ensure that workers are not chewed up and spit out without a job or a paycheck    When I was a member of the Illinois Senate  I worked to strengthen enforcement of the existing WARN Act by requiring the Illinois Department of Employment Security to annually notify employers of their responsibilities under the WARN Act   But we must act at the federal level to close the loophole that allows employers to disregard the WARN Act without penalty     Congress passed the WARN Act in 1988 to give workers and communities two months  advance notice to adjust to an impending plant closing or layoff   And where employers have complied with the law  retraining and other readjustment efforts have a much greater chance to succeed than when such programs are rushed into place because there was no advance notice of a plant closing   But despite the WARN Act  employers have all too often failed to provide workers with that vital notice   The GAO has found recently that 24 percent of all layoffs are subject to WARN requirements  yet employers provided notice in approximately one third of these situations  And courts have increasingly dismissed lawsuits brought by workers who have been unfairly denied notice     Senator Brown s FOREWARN Act would modernize and enhance the WARN Act s protections   I am proud to be a co sponsor of this important legislation   It would reduce the mass layoff figure from 50 to 25 employees  and reduce the threshold for coverage of firms from 100 to 50 employees   The FOREWARN Act would also lengthen the notification period from 60 to 90 days  require employers to provide written notification to the Labor Secretary  and increase penalties for violations of the WARN Act from back pay to double back pay   Finally  the bill authorizes the Labor Department to enforce the law  and permits state attorneys general to pursue claims if the Labor Secretary fails to act within six months   These are long overdue improvements in the law   Workers and their communities have a right to know when they are facing a serious risk of a plant closing   Making that information available before the plant closes can  in the best case scenario  help communities come together to prevent the loss and  in the worst case scenario  help workers and communities prepare for the difficult transition to come   Basic fairness and respect for working men and women require that we pass the FOREWARN Act                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
