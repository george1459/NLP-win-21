   Obama  Durbin  Hare Introduce Bill to Improve Student Behavior in Schools   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Durbin  Hare Introduce Bill to Improve Student Behavior in Schools Tuesday  October  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Christina Mulka  Durbin   or Tim Schlittner  Hare  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL   and Representative Phil Hare  D IL  today introduced the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act  H R  3407  S  2111   which directs resources to innovative programs designed to teach positive behavior as a way to improve school climate and make it easier for students to learn   Positive Behavior Support  PBS  programs define and support appropriate behaviors by explicitly teaching students about good behavior and including it as part of the curriculum    PBS programs have resulted in improved school climate and more time spent on learning   For example  at Lincoln Elementary School in Chicago Heights  the number of students sent to an administrator   s office for fighting dropped by half over the course of a year   At Springfield High School in Springfield  out of school suspensions decreased by 38   allowing students to learn more by reclaiming 180 school days that would otherwise have been lost to suspensions  At Mark Twain Primary School in Kankakee  disciplinary referrals decreased dramatically  from 268 before PBS compared to 38 last year  at the same time  ISAT reading and math scores are at an all time high       America   s teachers deserve our long term commitment so that they can provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed     said Senator Obama      Positive Behavior Support programs have proven successful in Illinois and throughout the country   They teach good behavior and reduce the need for discipline in the classroom  in turn allowing more time for teachers to teach   We must expand these innovative programs to teach our students about positive behavior   Let s give our teachers this additional tool to support their teaching  and let   s give our children the benefit of high expectations and supports for good behavior   These programs would not only strengthen our schools  but would bolster our nation   s competitiveness by providing the best possible learning environments for our next generation of leaders        When students act out  the classroom environment is damaged making it more difficult for students to learn and teachers to teach     said Durbin      Good behavior is a skill that can be learned and should be taught   Unfortunately  in many cases  children do not receive this lesson at home  Illinois is one state that has developed a system to address this problem in the classroom   These Positive Support Behavior programs can serve as a national model to improve student behavior   The bill that Senator Obama  Congressman Hare and I are introducing today will give teachers the resources they need to improve their classroom environment and allow more time for academic instruction        The old formula of attempting to yield good behavior and academic performance by threatening students with detention or other punishment has run its course     Hare said     The PBS approach rewards students for doing the right thing while recognizing that success in school is contagious  My visit to Monmouth Roseville Junior High in February convinced me that many students in PBS programs are motivating each other to reach new heights  As a member of the Education and Labor Committee  I felt compelled to introduce the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act   I look forward to working with Senator Obama and the Illinois PBIS Network to ensure this bill is included in the soon to be reauthorized No Child Left Behind law     In PBS schools  the adults act together to set common expectations  not just for learning  but for the behaviors that support learning   In any given school  the problem might be a general lack of discipline  too much bullying  or a loss of instructional time due to suspensions   Schools can address any of these problems  using proven practices  supported by a collaborative network of researchers  schools  and teachers  along with universities and resource centers that work with over 6 700 schools in 38 states  More than 700 schools in Illinois already use PBS      Illinois leads the nation in implementing school wide PBIS with over 700 schools in 179 districts supported by the Illinois PBIS Network     said Lucille Eber  Ed D   State Director of the IL PBIS Network      These schools are experiencing decreases in discipline problems  increases in academic achievement  and improved measures of school safety   Additionally  schools that achieve full implementation show greater capacity for success with students who have more serious behavioral learning needs   More importantly  we have seen these results increase and sustain over the past nine years in Illinois schools     Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act  To support PBS efforts  the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act amends Elementary and Secondary Education Act  ESEA  to make PBS an allowable use of funds  and proposes an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services  More specifically  the Act  Provides flexibility for use of Title I funds  State agencies may use these funds to provide technical assistance and support to schools as they implement PBS   Schools may use funds to improve school climate and academic achievement  Amends the needs assessments for use of Title II funds  so that they may take into account improvement of school climate in awarding subgrants for professional development  Amends the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities provision to include support for programs  such as PBS  that improve school climate and reduce discipline problems  Amends school counseling provisions  to ensure that applications for grants should include information on the need for behavioral intervention services  such as PBS  Amends the Department of Education Organization Act  to establish an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services   This office would coordinate the federal role in supporting counselors  school social workers  and others  who help teachers by providing academic and behavioral support for students  This legislation is supported by the American School Counselor Association  The Arc of the United States  National Association of State Directors of Special Education  and 23 other organizations
