   Senate Approves Obama Bill Providing  40 million for Homeless Veterans and Veterans Employment   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senate Approves Obama Bill Providing  40 million for Homeless Veterans and Veterans Employment Thursday  March 16  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  March 16  2006  Senate Approves Obama Bill Providing  40 million for Homeless Veterans and Veterans Employment   WASHINGTON   The Senate today unanimously approved legislation introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  that would provide  28 million in additional funding to help homeless veterans and  12 million dollars to increase employment services for veterans as part of the 2007 budget    Each and every night  more than 200 000 of our nation s veterans are homeless   said Obama   More than 400 000 will experience homelessness over the course of a year  In my home of Chicago  as many as 38 000 veterans spend a night homeless over the course of a year  but our government is doing far too little to help these veterans find homes and employment     Obama said his legislation would help homeless veterans by increasing funding for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program  HVRP   which provides food  clothing  mental health and substance abuse counseling  and employment and housing assistance to homeless veterans    The President s budget funds HVRP at less than half the intended level  Obama said that with its funding diminished  HVRP would only be able to assist 16 250 veterans next year  which amounts to less than one third of the homeless veterans in the Chicago area alone   Obama said his amendment would allow the program to help more than twice that many veterans   This funding would put a roof over the head of another 20 000 homeless veterans and would take another step towards ending the shame of a nation that allows those who risked their lives in war to come home to a life on the streets     Obama said the legislation would also provide an additional  12 million to the Department of Labor to improve jobs services for hard to place veterans  Earlier this year  Obama voiced concern about the fact that Illinois ranks dead last in job placement rates for veterans    According to Labor Department statistics  only 34 percent of Illinois veterans who seek assistance find jobs   said Obama   That s almost half the national average of 62 percent and nine points lower than the second worst state  Part of the solution to this problem is to increase funding for this program  which is why I am extremely pleased that this legislation passed the Senate today     Last year  Senator Obama has emerged as a leader on the issue of Homeless Veterans  He introduced the Sheltering All Veterans Everywhere Act  SAVE Act  to strengthen services for homeless veterans  The SAVE Act reauthorizes and expands two critical programs that serve veterans the HVRP and the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem  GPD  Program  which helps local governments and non profit organizations build  improve  maintain and staff homeless shelters and service operations  The SAVE Act would double funding for the GPD program to  200 million and extend HVRP to help prevent homelessness for at risk veterans    Senator Obama is a member of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee
