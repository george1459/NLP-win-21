   Obama  USDA Should Not Undermine Legislation to Help Black Farmers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  USDA Should Not Undermine Legislation to Help Black Farmers Wednesday  August  8  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Obama Press Office  202 228 5566 Reports show USDA employees improperly lobbied against Pigford legislation WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to examine recent allegations that USDA employees used federal resources to lobby against legislation that would allow black farmers to file claims under the Pigford settlement   According to federal law and USDA policies  the use of federal resources for lobbying members of Congress is strictly prohibited   The Pigford settlement  approved in 1999  allowed black farmers to file claims against the USDA for failing to respond to racial discrimination complaints between 1983 and 1997   Recently passed legislation in the House of Representatives would allow certain previously denied farmers an opportunity to re file their settlement claims and have them reviewed on their merits   Obama has introduced companion legislation  S  1989  in the Senate  The text of the letter is below    Dear Secretary Johanns  I am writing to express my serious concerns regarding recent reports that U S  Department of Agriculture   USDA   employees are using federal resources to lobby against recently passed legislation   Specifically  news reports indicate that certain USDA Farm Services Agency employees have been circulating an e mail encouraging their colleagues to contact members of Congress to oppose provisions in the House passed Farm Bill   The targeted provisions would provide unjustly denied black farmers an opportunity to have their claims filed pursuant to the Pigford settlement reviewed on the merits  As you know  the use of federal resources for lobbying is specifically prohibited by 18 U S C    1913  which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for activities that directly or indirectly are  intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress  to favor  adopt  or oppose       any legislation  law  ratification  or appropriation  whether before or after the introduction of any bill   As the   this statute is  interpreted to prohibit government employees from engaging in substantial grass roots lobbying campaigns using telegrams  letters  or other forms of communication that directly or indirectly encourage the public to contact members of Congress in support of  or in opposition to  legislation       The e mails referenced in various media accounts appear to violate both USDA ethics guidance and federal law   The news reports note that some USDA employees have circulated a message urging their colleagues to rally against the Pigford provision in the House passed Farm Bill   The e mails quote Carolyn Cooksie  Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs as saying it would be  awful  to allow 73 000 late filers to qualify for awards   The e mails go on to warn of what would happen if the bill passes  The agency will be required to submit a boatload of information within 60 days of anyone filing which will bury us   Not to mention  most of this information we don t have        Carolyn is doing a lot of legwork in the Senate trying to stop it but NACS  National Association of Credit Specialists   NASE  and other FSA  Farm Service Agency  employees need to contact their senators and work hard to get it stopped   The contacts need to be made before the debate starts in the Senate        Remember  don t make contacts using the office telephone or computer   Send your contacts from home or from another location other than the office  but send them  I appreciate that Farm Services Agency employees have received a memorandum reminding them of the legal prohibitions against lobbying with federal resources   However  the employees  e mails raise a larger question of whether the Department is capable even now of providing black farmers   and all farmers   with fair and equal access to USDA loans and services   As you are well aware  the Pigford settlement was an acknowledgement that black farmers suffered discrimination from the USDA for many years   It is unconscionable that some USDA employees appear to be more concerned about their workloads than on correcting a serious injustice   I ask that you publicly disavow the apparent efforts of these employees to undermine the attempts to provide justice to Pigford claimants   I also ask that you notify me by August 15  2007  as to what steps you have taken to remedy this situation and prevent a recurrence  including employee training or disciplinary action   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
