   Obama Bill Would Make Election Fraud  Voter Intimidation Illegal   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Bill Would Make Election Fraud  Voter Intimidation Illegal Thursday  June  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt       WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today testified in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on voter intimidation and election fraud   Senators Obama and Schumer  D NY  introduced the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 earlier in the year   This bill would make voter intimidation and election misinformation punishable by law  and contains strong penalties so that people who commit these crimes suffer more than just a slap on the wrist  It would also address the real harm of these crimes    people who are prevented from voting by misinformation     by establishing a process for reaching out to these misinformed voters with accurate information so they can cast their votes in time  Calculated efforts to disenfranchise voters persist each year and during every election to achieve unfair political advantage   During the previous election in 2006  thousands of Latino voters in Orange County  California received letters telling them that if they were immigrants and voted they would be jailed   In Maryland  voters received fabricated sample Democratic ballots that featured Republican candidates for governor and senator   And in Virginia  voters were phoned by a fraudulent    Virginia Elections Commission    claiming they were ineligible to vote   There are countless other examples  and these practices must be stopped   His testimony is below      It   s hard to imagine that we even need a bill like this   But  unfortunately  there are people who will stop at nothing to try to deceive voters and keep them away from the polls   What   s worse  these practices often target and exploit vulnerable populations  such as minorities  the disabled  the elderly  or the poor          We see these problems year after year and election and after election  and my hope is that this bill will finally stop these practices in time for the next election          The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act makes voter intimidation and deception punishable by law  and it contains strong penalties so that people who commit these crimes suffer more than just a slap on the wrist   The bill also seeks to address the real harm of these crimes    people who are prevented from voting by misinformation     by establishing a process for reaching out to these misinformed voters with accurate information so they can cast their votes in time          There are some issues in this country that are inherently difficult and political   Making sure that every American can cast a ballot shouldn   t be one of them   There is no place for politics in this debate     no room for those who feel that they can gain a partisan advantage by keeping people away from the polls   As the members of this Committee know all too well  politics have colored some of the recent actions of the Department of Justice  so our bill includes a private right of action to ensure that individuals who are victims of deceptive information have legal recourse if an Attorney General turns a blind eye to these types of practices          As the New York Times stated in its January 31st editorial on this issue     the bill     is an important step toward making elections more honest and fair  There is no reason it should not be passed by Congress unanimously      I ask that this editorial be placed into the record          It   s time to get this done in a bipartisan fashion  and I believe this bill can make it happen   I look forward to working with you  Chairman Cardin  Senator Schumer  Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter  and the other members of the Committee  as well as the many co sponsors of this bill  to pass this legislation this Congress
