   Obama Calls on Chao to Support Sick Nuclear Weapons Employees Thursday  October 25  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  calling on her to support former nuclear weapons workers in Illinois who have failed to receive compensation through the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  for illnesses related to their employment at nuclear waste facilities during the Cold War   For years  Cold War veterans from 29 current and former facilities in Illinois have waited to have their claims processed  and in turn have struggled with soaring health care costs   Ensuring these former employees are properly compensated has been a priority for Senator Obama   He has met with many of these workers and their families  his staff has helped victims with their claims  and he has also requested answers from agency heads   Obama also threatened to block the nominations of Administration officials until he received answers from government agencies on the lack of compensation  Recently  Secretary Chao recognized problems with EEOICPA  but failed to specify how the Department of Labor would correct them   In the letter  Obama calls on Chao to urge President Bush to improve communication within the agencies to speed up compensation  issue subpoenas to the agencies and corporations that maintain worker records  clarify current DOL policies on the EEOICPA  and meet with Illinois    former nuclear weapons employees who have been frustrated by the current process    The text of the letter is below  The Honorable Elaine Chao  Secretary  Department of Labor  Frances Perkins Building  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20210 Dear Secretary Chao  I am writing regarding some recent comments you made to the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce regarding the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA    As you know  our Cold War veterans have waited years to get their claims processed   Unfortunately  when a decision is finally made on a worker s claim  the integrity of that decision is often in doubt  I am encouraged to hear that you recognize the problems with how EEOICPA is administered   Nonetheless  what is not clear from your comments is what role you believe the Department of Labor plays in creating these problems or what you are doing to correct them   According to the Paducah Sun on October 5  2007         We recognize there have been problems with this program      Chao  said at Thursday   s Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce breakfast   Chao said her staff has urged other agencies    especially the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health    to quickly address the concerns to help people get paid more quickly      And for many of these families time is running out     Chao said       I agree with you that time is running out for many of these workers   Every few weeks  I hear about another Illinois nuclear worker who has passed away without having his or her claim resolved   What I am concerned about  however is that your comments seem to place the blame for this program   s problems at the feet of every other agency  except the Department of Labor  DOL    To be sure  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  as well as the Department of Energy  share responsibility for EEOICPA   s problems   But a great deal of responsibility for the proper administration of this program rests with DOL  and I am troubled that your comments do not recognize that fact   If DOL is serious about helping nuclear workers under EEOICPA  there are a number of actions that you could take that would be of great value  1   Urge the President to provide the proper balance of worker  medical  and scientific perspectives on the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health by appointing board members who represent the interests of workers or the medical community   2   Issue subpoenas to the corporations and government agencies that maintain the records for the work they did to develop our nation   s nuclear weapons   To date  DOL has issued only one subpoena  3   Provide a written response to the following  a   Does the Department of Labor consider worker affidavits to be true if there is no documentation to establish that their testimony is false  b  What policy  statute or regulation does the Department of Labor use when evaluating the weight to give worker testimony when making decisions related to EEOICPA claims and or SEC petitions              4   Meet with Illinois    former nuclear weapons workers who have found this compensation program administered by the Department of Labor to be so frustrating   Specifically  workers of the former Dow Chemical site in Madison  IL have waited nearly seven years for a decision on their claim   To date  only two have gone through the process of dose reconstruction   I believe you would find it valuable to speak directly with these workers and their survivors and hear first hand about the ongoing frustrations they have with this program   Should you be willing to meet with these workers  I would be happy to arrange the meeting at your earliest convenience    Thank you for your consideration to this request  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
