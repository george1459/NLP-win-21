Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Andre Carson  D IN  today sent a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Labor  Elaine Chao  asking for the release of National Emergency Grant funds to assist over 1 200 flight attendants and former employees of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines who recently lost their jobs of as a result of the abrupt termination in service    The members noted that it will be difficult for these working Americans to find new jobs as the airline industry continues to shrink    I am concerned that this troubled airline industry  which is facing massive layoffs and service shutdowns  will not be able to absorb the hard working flight attendants and airline personnel that have lost their jobs   said Durbin    We have come together on a bipartisan basis to see that the 1 200 workers   over 850 in Illinois   and their families have access to the resources they need to start again      With recent mass layoffs at ATA and Aloha Airlines  over a thousand workers are now without jobs   said Obama    These airlines collapsed in the face of skyrocketing fuel prices  a consolidating aviation industry  and a declining economy   I join Senator Durbin and Congressman Carson in calling on Secretary Chao to provide these workers with targeted assistance and emergency training grants   Families in Chicago  Indianapolis  and Honolulu need to know that their government is there when this kind of crisis hits  and I am committed to helping these families get the help they need    It is increasingly important that the U S  Department of Labor act with the utmost urgency in bestowing adequate aid and immediate assistance to the recently displaced workers of ATA and Aloha Airlines   said Carson  Other signatories on today s letter include

attached   April 25  2008 The Honorable Elaine L  Chao  U S  Department of Labor  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20210 Dear Secretary Chao  The termination of operations of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines has resulted in the abrupt dislocation of over 1 200 flight attendants and other personnel  including customer service agents    Given the current state of the aviation industry  it will be difficult for these working Americans to find new jobs in the shrinking US airline industry   In the past  many dislocated or furloughed flight attendants found jobs with other carriers  but the job market in aviation today is poor  The Aloha and ATA flight attendants who are now unemployed had served more than 10 years on average in their specialized fields   The length of service with their company means that the vast majority of these flight attendants have not participated in the job market for more than a decade  A successful transition to a new career requires targeted dislocated worker intervention services   For these particular workers  and especially the flight attendants  whose unemployment follows years of wage and work rule concessions during bankruptcy for their carrier  we urge you to consider releasing National Emergency Grant funds to address their specific re training needs    We urge you to quickly evaluate whether the termination of operations of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines qualify as eligible events for National Emergency Grant  NEG  funding  and if so identify these flight attendants as a target population eligible for specialized assistance    If the flight attendants qualify  we further request that you issue a special guidance letter to all states and local workforce investment boards to announce the immediate availability of NEG funds and to encourage the development of expanded dislocated intervention services for these flight attendants   If they do not qualify  we request an explanation and alternative services that the Department can make available to them  We ask that you make this determination as quickly as possible and notify us as soon as that decision is made                                    Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
