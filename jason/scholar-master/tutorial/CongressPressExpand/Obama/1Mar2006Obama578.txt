   Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Ethics Commission Press Conference   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Ethics Commission Press Conference Thursday  February 16  2006  Below  please find Senator Obama s remarks from today s press conference about his proposed ethics commission  Joining Obama was Anthony M  Wilhoit  retired chief judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals and current executive director of the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission     From the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission Website     In 1993  the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission was established by an extraordinary session of the General Assembly which enacted the Code of Legislative Ethics  The Commission is an independent authority within the Legislative Department of state government  It is charged with the enforcement of the Code and is composed of nine citizen members  The Code regulates conduct by legislators  lobbyists and the employers of lobbyists   To learn more  please visit    Remarks of Senator Barack Obama  Ethics Commission Press Conference  Washington  DC  February 16th  2006   I d like to thank Judge Wilhoit for being here today to share with us some of the progress they ve made in Kentucky as a result of the ethics reforms that have taken place in that state      You know  one of the greatest travesties of the scandal that s plagued Washington is not what Congress did  but what it didn t do      Because for all the noise we ve heard from the media about the bribes accepted by Congressman Duke Cunningham  the thousands of dollars in free meals accepted by other congressmen  and the  K Street Project  that filled lobbying firms with former Republican staffers  we ve heard only silence from the very place that should have caught these ethics violations in the first place   the House Ethics Committee    For years now  it s been common knowledge that this committee has largely failed in its responsibility to investigate and bring to light the kind of wrongdoing between Members of Congress and lobbyists that we re now seeing splashed across the front pages   And the sad truth is that neither the House nor the Senate ethics process inspires public confidence that Congress can serve as an effective watchdog over its own Members    All of this means that in the coming weeks  we can pass all the ethics reforms we want   gift bans  travel bans  lobbying restrictions   but none of them will make a difference if there isn t a nonpartisan  independent body that will help us enforce those laws   You don t crack down on crime by hoping criminals will turn themselves in  and you can t clean up corruption by trusting Congress to police itself      That s why I ve recently introduced legislation that would create a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission to act as the American public s watchdog over Congress   This proposed Commission would be staffed with former judges and former Members of Congress from both parties  and it would allow any citizen to report a possible ethics violation by lawmakers  staff  or lobbyists      The Commission would have the authority to conduct investigations  issue subpoenas  gather records  call witnesses  and provide its full public report to the Department of Justice or the House and Senate Ethics Committees      This would improve the current process in two ways   First  it would take politics out of the initial fact finding phase of ethics investigations   Second  it would exert greater public pressure on Congress  which would retain the ultimate authority to punish any wrongdoing    The idea of an independent body to conduct initial investigations of ethics violations is not new  as similar commissions have been formed in Florida  Tennessee  and Kentucky  which the Judge will tell us about shortly      On the national level  a similar proposal was also suggested in 1997 by Representative David Dreier  a Republican  and former Representative Lee Hamilton  who I m happy to say has endorsed this current legislation as well   Today  this idea has support from a wide range of organizations and scholars across the political spectrum  from Common Cause to Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute     It s my hope that we can build bipartisan support for this proposal in the weeks to come   In the end  the true test of ethics reform is not whether we pass a set of laws that appeal to a lowest common denominator that we can all agree on  it s whether we pass the strongest bill with the strongest reforms possible that can truly change the way we do business in Washington  That s what the American people will be watching for  and that s what we owe them   Enforcing the laws we pass is a crucial step toward reaching this goal and restoring the public s faith in a government that stands up for their interests and respects their values     THE CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION ACT  Senator Barack Obama has proposing the creation of a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission to receive complaints from the public on alleged ethics violations by members of Congress  staff  and lobbyists   The Commission would have authority to investigate complaints and present public findings of fact about possible violations to the House and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department   This proposal  which is endorsed by Common Cause and Norm Ornstein  is modeled after similar state commissions in Kentucky  Florida  and Tennessee     Composition  The Commission would be comprised of nine Commissioners chosen by the leaders of Congress   Four of the Commissioners must be former federal judges  and four must be former members of Congress  During their service  Commissioners would be prohibited from serving as a fundraiser for a Senate or House candidate  contributing to a candidate for federal office  serving as an officer in a political party  acting as a registered lobbyist  and participating in the management or conduct of a political campaign   Investigative Powers In conducting its investigations of alleged violations  the Commission would have the authority to issue subpoenas  compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents  and take depositions   All Commission proceedings  including the initial complaint  would remain confidential until a final determination is made   Following a preliminary investigation of a complaint  the Commission would have several options   dismiss the complaint  confidentially inform the alleged violator of potential violations and provide information to ensure future compliance with the law  or upon a majority vote  initiate an adjudicatory proceeding to determine whether to present a case to the House and Senate Ethics Committee or the Department of Justice   The House and Senate Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice would retain the ultimate authority to discipline members of Congress  Frivolous Complaints   To avoid manipulation of the Commission for political purposes  any person filing a complaint that they knew to be false would be subject to a  10 000 fine and up to one year in jail   That person also would be barred from filing any future complaints        No complaints could be filed against a member of Congress in the three months prior to an election to ensure that complaints are not filed for political purposes        What People Have Been Saying about Obama s Legislation We believe that this legislation would do more to reform ethics and lobbying than any other piece of legislation introduced thus far because it goes to the heart of the problem  enforcement      Chellie Pingree  President  Common Cause This approach to ethics enforcement is just the kind of balanced and reasonable alternative we need  Enforcement of ethics in Congress needs independence and credibility to all  but cannot become either a vehicle for the criminalization of policy differences or an avenging angel like the Independent Counsel statute created  This commission would have on it people of integrity and institutional sensitivity  and could serve to educate members and staff about ethical behavior and performance while also providing vigorous and credible enforcement of ethical standards   It deserves strong bipartisan support       Norm Ornstein  American Enterprise Institute Given this deplorable situation  Public Citizen applauds Sen  Barack Obama  D Ill   for having the courage to challenge the business as usual environment on Capitol Hill and introduce far reaching legislation that would establish a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission  made up of people outside Congress but appointed by House and Senate leaders  The commission would be a much needed independent and non partisan watchdog charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance to the nation s ethics and lobbying laws       Public Citizen  This bill effectively addresses the fundamental problem of ethics regulation in Congress    the ultimate conflict of interest in which members have total control over every part of the process by which they judge one another   The bill would provide a measure of independent judgment  which is necessary to make the final judgments that Congress reaches more credible  It would also discourage politically motivated ethics charges   None of the other reforms that have been proposed will make much difference unless they are accompanied by this kind of change in the process of enforcement   This bill would strengthen the essential constitutional principle that James Madison emphasized   a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time        Dennis F  Thompson  Professor of Government  Harvard University   and author of  Ethics in Congress    This is the first bill that deals seriously with the lack of oversight and enforcement in the existing congressional ethics process   Senator Obama has listened to the concerns of watchdog organizations and has addressed them   This bill will help restore Americans  confidence in the integrity of Congress      Melanie Sloan  Executive Director  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  The Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission Act represents a genuine and constitutional attempt to rejuvenate and further professionalize the legislative self disciplinary process   Its enactment would achieve a proper balance between diminishing the potential for political exploitation of the system and according appropriate safeguards and due process to respondents  all of which would increase public confidence in the congressional self disciplinary power      Stanley M  Brand  Esq   Brand Law Group  Senator Obama s excellent reform is about improving enforcement and transparency which is desperately needed in Washington right now  He proposes to bring an objective  nonpartisan approach to evaluating the link between lobbyists and Members of Congress  something the Ethics Committees have failed to do  Senator Obama has taken the lead in cleaning up Washington with his three reform bills      James A  Thurber  Director and Distinguished Professor  Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies  American University
