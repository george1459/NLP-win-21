               Obama Calls on President to Work with Congress to Implement 9 11 Commission Tuesday  August 15  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs   202  228 5511  Date  August 15  2006  Obama Calls on President to Work with Congress to Implement 9 11 Commission Recommendations and Better Protect the United States   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Tuesday criticized the President and Republican controlled Congress for failing to implement and fund the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission to protect our homeland from future terrorist attacks    Obama said that last week s disclosure of a plot in Great Britain to bring liquid explosives onto airplanes demonstrates that  there are too many glaring gaps in our security efforts here at home     From improving security for our rail and transit systems and our chemical plants  to increasing cargo screening in our airports and ports  the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission have been underfunded  or worse  ignored   Obama wrote   Indeed  the 9 11 Commission gave the Administration dismal marks   5 F s and 12 D s   on the implementation of the Commission s recommendations for homeland security     Obama noted that he and his Senate Democratic colleagues have attempted to increase funding for rail security  aviation security and chemical plant security  but these efforts have been rejected by the majority party in Congress  He also voiced concern that President Bush has submitted budgets that have called for decimating programs for first responders     Now more than ever  we need to come together to address the real security needs of the nation   Obama said   I hope the White House and Congress can work to immediately address the 9 11 Commission recommendations and provide adequate funding to guard against terrorist attacks      For the full text of Obama s letter  please see below     August 15  2006   President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    Like all Americans  I am grateful for the work of the British intelligence service  combined with the swift response by authorities across the globe  to prevent what could have been a major terrorist attack last week   Unfortunately  in the more than two years since the bipartisan 9 11 Commission released its report  the Administration has failed to implement many of its most important recommendations and still seems to suffer from the  failure of imagination  that the 9 11 Commission identified   As a result  there are too many glaring gaps in our security efforts here at home    From improving security for our rail and transit systems and our chemical plants  to increasing cargo screening in our airports and ports  the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission have been underfunded  or worse  ignored   Indeed  the 9 11 Commission gave the Administration dismal marks   5 F s and 12 D s   on the implementation of the Commission s recommendations for homeland security     Over the past year and a half  I have joined my Democratic colleagues in the Senate on numerous occasions to fight for funding to ensure that Americans are protected from the next generation of terrorist attacks   However  our efforts have been consistently thwarted by the party controlling the White House and Congress    In July 2005  just a week after the London subway bombings  Sen  Byrd proposed adding  1 2 billion for transit security grants and  265 million for rail security to the FY 2006 Homeland Security appropriations bill   Sen  Schumer also offered amendments to improve the screening of air cargo and to track the shipment of hazardous materials   All three amendments were rejected by Senate Republicans  In March 2006  during the consideration of the FY 2007 Budget Resolution  Sen  Lieberman offered a comprehensive amendment to increase homeland security spending that included  1 billion for rail and transit security   752 million for aviation security  and  150 million for chemical security   This amendment was rejected by Senate Republicans   Sen  Menendez also offered an amendment to increase funding for port security by  965 million   This  too  was rejected by Senate Republicans  And just last month  during the consideration of the FY 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill  Sen  Schumer and Sen  Biden offered amendments to increase funding for rail and transit security  but these amendments were also rejected by Senate Republicans     In short  Congress  failure to adequately fund homeland security has left our nation vulnerable to attacks     The Administration also has submitted budgets that have called for decimating programs for first responders   This year  the Administration s budget proposed eliminating the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and cutting funds for Emergency Management Performance Grants  both critical sources of homeland funds for our communities      I am also disappointed that the Administration has not taken a lead in pushing for balanced and robust chemical plant security legislation  as Sen  Lautenberg and I have proposed   Five years after September 11  our nation s unguarded chemical plants remain tempting targets for terrorists     In the days after 9 11  the nation was prepared to join together to shore up our defenses and fight the very real terrorist threat we are facing   Unfortunately  that strong sense of national purpose has been tossed aside in favor of partisanship and political brinkmanship   As a result  we are woefully unprepared today on a number of fronts  including rail  port  chemical plant  and cargo security    Now more than ever  we need to come together to address the real security needs of the nation   I hope the White House and Congress can work to immediately address the 9 11 Commission recommendations and provide adequate funding to guard against terrorist attacks      Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
