Contact  Natalie Ravitz  Boxer                                                                                        Shana Marchio  Bond     Ben LaBolt  Obama                                                                                                            Rob Sawicki  Lieberman    Clinton press office  Amy Brundage Vincent Morris  Kerry   Washington  D C    A bipartisan group of U S  Senators led by Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Kit Bond  R MO  today expressed deep concern to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about the state of mental health care services for soldiers at Ft  Carson  Colorado   In December  the Senators wrote to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs William Winkenwerder after National Public Radio  NPR  aired a story detailing the failure of officials at Ft  Carson to provide adequate treatment for soldiers suffering from service connected mental health problems  including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD     And last week  the Senators  along with Senators Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Hillary Clinton  D NY   and John Kerry  D MA   dispatched their staff to Ft  Carson to meet with soldiers and commanding officers to investigate allegations of inadequate mental health care for troops       Our troops are risking their lives for this country  and the sad reality is they are not being given the mental health care services they need and deserve to stay healthy and strong     Senator Boxer said      This problem is not unique to Ft  Carson   clearly we need to be doing more across the board to improve mental health services for our Armed Forces  and to do that we need a strong commitment from the Secretary of Defense   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans        A growing number of service members at Ft  Carson and throughout our military hospitals are returning from war with serious psychological injuries that must not go untreated  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling between the cracks     said Senator Obama      We must implement comprehensive reforms that boost mental health resources and training at our military bases  reduce the strain on our troops and provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those who are affected   That s why I ve called for individual  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members and for important new pre and post deployment screenings for traumatic brain injuries          When it comes to the poor treatment of some of our soldiers returning from combat  the revelations presented to my staff make Walter Reed look like a minor plot in a greater tragedy     said Senator Bond      The military   s handling of some soldiers suffering from mental health problems is unacceptable   We cannot allow the government to continue to fail these soldiers and their families who have sacrificed so much for this country          We have no greater moral obligation than to provide the best care to our soldiers     Senator Lieberman said      Many of them are facing mental health issues and we must provide them with timely and state of the art care  I was pleased by the commitment of the leadership at Ft  Carson to investigate any mishandling of service members    cases and I am committed to working with them and my Senate colleagues to ensure that our soldiers and military leadership have the resources they need to cope with the signature injuries of this war          We have a duty to our wounded warriors to reform and ready the military for the increasing number of veterans suffering from complex injuries like traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder     said Senator Clinton      After a recent Congressional staff delegation visit to Fort Carson  it is clear that much more remains to be done to improve access to mental health care for our wounded service members  to address the stigma that surrounds mental health issues  and to educate commanders on how to deal with soldiers suffering from these types of injuries          We must address all the wounds of war of our heroes when they return home     including the less visible ones  PTSD and traumatic brain injuries  I   m optimistic that this was a productive meeting   Major General Hammond and the leadership at the meeting listened intently to our concerns about access to mental health services for our soldiers     Senator Kerry said      This was an important step forward  and we feel strongly the military knows we mean business and they   ll work with Congress to make sure we are doing everything possible to support our soldiers and veterans  We urge the Secretary of Defense to listen and get our troops the care they need and deserve      The Senators today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asking him to ensure that Ft  Carson is given the resources and direction necessary to provide an optimal level of care for our service members    May 22  2007  The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   In recent months  troubling allegations have surfaced at Ft  Carson  Colorado  suggesting that soldiers are not receiving adequate care for mental health problems incurred as a result of combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Specifically  soldiers have asserted that they are not receiving comprehensive treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI  and mental health issues  such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD    They have also alleged that the command climate discourages soldiers from seeking help for these problems   As a result  we dispatched members of our staff to Ft  Carson last week to investigate these claims   While Ft  Carson has taken some important steps to improve care for soldiers   including implementing mandatory TBI screening and enhancing the pre  and post deployment screening process  the reality remains that the base is facing significant challenges in providing mental health care services   The Department of Defense Mental Health Task Force recently found that the stigma of mental illness and injury is pervasive across our Armed Forces   and Ft  Carson is proving to be no exception   After meeting with soldiers as well as commanders at the base  our staff concluded that the stigma of mental illness is a significant barrier to care   They also determined there is a considerable lack of resources to adequately support the psychological needs of our service members and their families  and a lack of training and education regarding mental health problems for leaders from the division level to the unit level   These issues are severely impairing the ability of our Army and the Department of Defense to produce and maintain the best trained and equipped military fighting force in the world   While visiting the base  our staff received a commitment from Major General Jeffrey Hammond  Commander 4th Infantry Division  that he will investigate claims of command intimidation and lack of access to timely mental health services   They also received his commitment to train military personnel on the mental health challenges many of our service members face   While we are pleased at this commitment  it is apparent that the challenges at Ft  Carson cannot be solved by General Hammond alone   Therefore  we urge you to ensure that Ft  Carson and every other military installation facing similar problems are given the resources and direction necessary to provide an optimal level of care for our service members   We will be following up with a more detailed staff report on Ft  Carson in the near future  and we expect the Department of Defense to immediately review those findings and take appropriate action to see that any and all problems are corrected   Congress and the American people have made clear  especially following the revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  that substandard care for injured service members will not be tolerated   These men and women have stood up for our country  and we have no greater obligation than to stand with them and their families in their hours of greatest need   Please respond as soon as possible to indicate your plans to address these issues   Sincerely   Senator Barbara Boxer   Senator Barack Obama   Senator Christopher Bond   Senator Joseph Lieberman   Senator Hillary Clinton   Senator John Kerry
