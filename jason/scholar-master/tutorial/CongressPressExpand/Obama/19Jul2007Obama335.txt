   Senator Obama and Rep  Slaughter Introduce Legislation to Protect Children from Lead Poisoning   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senator Obama and Rep  Slaughter Introduce Legislation to Protect Children from Lead Poisoning Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Frank Benenati  Slaughter  or Ben Labolt  Obama  14 Percent of child care facilities contain toxic lead Washington D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Louise M  Slaughter  D NY 28  today introduced legislation in the Senate and House respectively to protect children from lead poisoning   The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act requires that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  The bill also would establish a five year   42 6 million grant program to help local communities pay to make these facilities safe  and set up  best practices  standards for communities to test for and reduce lead hazards       Lead poisoning continues to pose an enormous threat to our children   s health and safety in day care facilities and schools in Illinois and across America     said Senator Obama     The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act requires all child care facilities to be certified lead safe within five years   The Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed key parts of this proposal with a rule that would require mandatory lead safety training and certification of our schools    contractors  We must act on these basic precautions to keep our children healthy and our schools lead free          Tens of millions of parents entrust the health and welfare of their children to schools and child care facilities every day  and yet millions of boys and girls are exposed to a lead level that will affect them for life     Rep  Slaughter said   This quiet tragedy is entirely avoidable  and we have to do everything in our power to make lead poisoning and its effects a thing of the past    While lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of exposure  lead can also enter tap water through corroded water lines and pipes  Lead in drinking water can account for as many as 60 percent of the exposure for infants and children who consume formula and concentrated juices   Children suffer the greatest negative health impacts  since lead adversely impacts physical and mental development  Specifically  exposure to lead toxins results in decreased intelligence and behavioral problems  and can also lead to kidney damage  anemia  reproductive disorders  seizures  coma  and even death   According to the Centers for Disease Control  about 310 000 children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  with poor and minority children disproportionately at risk  The problem of lead contamination is especially great in the Midwest and Northeast  where 40 percent of child care centers were built prior to 1960  BACKGROUND   The Impact on Illinois and New York  Illinois suffers from the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  with 20 5 percent of all reported elevated blood levels occurring within the state  Illinois  African American and Hispanic children are at significantly higher risk levels than non minority children   Each year in New York State  10 000 new children under the age of six are identified as having elevated blood lead levels  More than 200 000 children in New York contracted lead poisoning between 1992 and 2004  Children exposed to harmful levels of lead often require special education  medical care  and supervision  often exceeding  4 billion per year in the state alone   A National Epidemic  Nationally  lead poisoning affects 310 000 American children annually  and has been linked to serious health problems ranging from brain damage and hearing loss to comas and death   In 2003  the Department of Housing and Urban Development   s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control found that 14 percent of licensed child care facilities had significant lead hazards   At facilities where the majority of children attending were African  American  30 percent were determined to pose serious risks of lead poisoning   A lack of enforcement  Nearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care  An estimated 14 percent of licensed child care centers nationwide are contaminated with hazardous levels of lead based paint  according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development   A report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant  systemic problems with the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  monitors and regulates the levels of lead in our nation s drinking water  including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make assessments and decisions  The GAO study found that few schools and child care facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead and no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results  Few states have comprehensive programs to detect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities
