                   Obama Calls on Labor Department to Prevent Minimum Wage and Overtime Violations Friday  July 25  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Recent GAO reports conclude Labor Department enforcement inadequate WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  expressing concerns that the Department of Labor is not fulfilling its mission to prevent and remedy violations of federal minimum wage and overtime laws   As cited in a recent editorial in the New York Times  two Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports noted serious problems at the Wage and Hour Division  WHD  of the Labor Department   One report concluded that WHD is not adequately assuring employer compliance   Another report  found an alarming lapse in the Department s handling of individual worker complaints   Despite GAO s conclusions  Acting Administrator of WHD Alexander Passantino  whose nomination is pending in the Senate  testified before the House Education and Labor Committee that GAO was categorically wrong in all of its major findings    In the letter  Obama asks Secretary Chao about Mr  Passantino s categorical rejection of GAO s findings and recommendations and how she will remedy the problems raised    The text of the letter is below    Dear Madame Secretary   I am writing to express serious concerns regarding recent reports that the U S  Department of Labor is not fulfilling its mission to prevent and remedy violations of federal minimum wage and overtime laws   It is important that the Department put procedures into place that will lead to improvements in the enforcement of workers  rights   This is the core mission of the Department and failing to adequately enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act  FLSA  is unacceptable   Most recently  two Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports shed light on serious problems at the Wage and Hour Division  WHD    One report addressed the overall effectiveness of the Division s enforcement procedures  finding that WHD is not adequately assuring employer compliance   It found that the WHD did not effectively take advantage of available information and tools in planning and conducting its compliance activities  failed to use key data on complaints and input from external groups   such as employer and worker advocacy organizations   to inform its planning process   This report also found that WHD focused on the same four industries from 1997 to 2007  despite information from its own commissioned studies that there were other low wage industries that had equally high rates of potential wage and hour violations   Finally  the GAO concluded that the agency does not sufficiently leverage its existing tools and partnerships to encourage employers to comply with the law  Another GAO report found alarming lapses in the Department s handling of individual worker complaints   GAO found frequent instances where WHD   1  inappropriately rejected complaints based on incorrect information provided by employers   2  failed to make adequate attempts to locate employers   3  did not thoroughly investigate and resolve complaints  and  4  delayed initiating investigations for excessive periods of time     Last week  Acting Administrator of WHD Alexander Passantino  whose nomination is pending in the Senate  testified before the House Education and Labor Committee that GAO was categorically wrong in all of its major findings   I would like to know whether you agree with Mr  Passantino s categorical rejection of GAO s findings and recommendations    If so  I would appreciate a detailed response explaining the basis on which you have rejected the conclusions of GAO  an independent agency whose mission is to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people    If in fact you disagree with Mr  Passantino  I would like you to explain specifically what steps you plan to take to address the shortcomings in the process that the report raises   GAO s conclusions about how the Department exercises its responsibilities to working Americans raise serious  but addressable  issues   Fixing these problems may require bipartisan cooperation  or in some cases additional funding  but other needed reforms are in the sole discretion of the Department  and can be instituted unilaterally     I understand that the Congressional committees of jurisdiction will be sending the Department detailed questions in conjunction with both the House hearing and Mr  Passantino s nomination   I look forward to your responses to those questions  as well as to this communication   I further hope that you will direct the Acting Administrator to revisit his recent statement and commit to reforming the Wage and Hour Division for the benefit all workers   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
