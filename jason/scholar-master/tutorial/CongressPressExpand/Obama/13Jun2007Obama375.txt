   Obama to Paulson  Defend American Workers and Businesses by Challenging China   s Currency Manipulation   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama to Paulson  Defend American Workers and Businesses by Challenging China   s Currency Manipulation Wednesday  June 13  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt       Asks him to reconsider refusal to classify China as a currency manipulator WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Paulson asking him to reconsider the decision not to classify China as a currency manipulator   Dear Secretary Paulson  The People   s Republic of China has manipulated its currency for years in order to gain an unfair advantage over the United States in trade   Unfortunately  the Administration has failed to effectively challenge or change China   s behavior   And today  the Department of the Treasury has refused yet again to declare that China is manipulating its currency   I call on the Treasury Department to reconsider today   s decision   Your department   s refusal to take action against China raises serious questions about the Administration   s commitment to protecting the interests of American businesses and American workers   At least partially as a result of the Administration   s failure to address Chinese currency manipulation  the U S  imported more than  232 billion in goods from China than we sold to it last year   That constitutes an annual growth in the imbalance in trade of 73 percent   Refusing to acknowledge the problem will not make it go away   As a result  I will work with colleagues in the Congress to force action and strengthen the ability of Americans losing out from Chinese currency manipulation to bring forward complaints for remedy through increased duties on Chinese goods   The Administration   s refusal to take strong action against China   s currency manipulation will also make it more difficult to obtain congressional approval for renewed Trade Promotion Authority  as well as additional trade agreements   Treasury   s refusal even to acknowledge the costs of Chinese currency manipulation  justifies the fear of many Americans that this Administration lacks the will to stand up against trade abuses and labor or environmental violations that create an unfair playing field for American workers   As a result  I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that any trade agreement brought before the Congress is measured not against Administration commitments but instead against the rights of Americans to protection from unfair trade practices including currency manipulation and the violation of international labor and environmental standards  Again  I urge you to reconsider today   s decision not to take action against China for currency manipulation   Thank you     Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
