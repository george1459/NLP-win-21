        Obama  U S  Must Protect Children From Lead  Safeguard Imported Toys Tuesday  August 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Obama Press Office 202 228  5566 Mattel today announced the recall of 253 000 lead contaminated toy jeeps WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to U S  Trade Representative  Ambassador Susan Schwab  about the large number of lead tainted toys manufactured in China that have been subject to federal government recalls   In the letter  Obama requests information as to whether the USTR has raised concerns about these toys with the Chinese government   Last week Obama called on the Toy Industry Association to provide insight as to how American companies are attempting to regulate foreign supply chains   And in July  he called on the Senate Commerce Committee to pass his Lead Free Toys Act of 2007  S  1306   which would protect our children from products containing lead  Obama originally introduced this legislation in November 2005  The text of the letter is below  Dear Ambassador Schwab  I am writing to urge the Office of the United States Trade Representative  USTR  to take aggressive action to protect America   s children from toys containing harmful levels of lead that are imported from China   This is a serious issue that compromises the health of children throughout the country  While lead paint has been banned in the United States since 1978  nearly half a million children continue to suffer from lead poisoning   Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health problems in young children including IQ deficiencies  reading and learning disabilities  reduced attention spans  hyperactivity  and damage to the kidneys  brain and bone marrow   Though the most common source of lead exposure is from lead paint in older homes  children are exposed to lead in other ways  including through the toys they play with in their homes  playgrounds  and schools  As you are no doubt aware  in recent months  there have been a number of high profile recalls of children   s products manufactured in China  In March 2007  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  announced three separate recalls of 108 600 units of children s necklaces and 128 700    Elite Operations    toy sets due to high lead paint content   In April  4 million    Groovy Grabber    bracelets and 396 000 metal key chains were recalled because of high lead content   In May  103 000 pieces of metal jewelry marketed in conjunction with    High School Musical    were recalled because of high lead content   In June  the RC2 Corporation recalled 1 5 million Thomas   Friends wooden toy railway sets that were coated with excessive levels of lead paint   Two weeks ago  Mattel announced the recall of 83 types of toys worldwide because the paint in the toys contained excessive amounts of lead   This worldwide recall involved almost 1 million plastic preschool toys  including the popular Big Bird  Elmo  Dora and Diego characters    And just today  Mattel announced the recall of 253 000 toy jeeps featuring the Sarge character from the movie    Cars       Since we first learned about the dangers of these products  the CPSC has taken steps to remove these toys from store shelves   But recent product recalls raise a larger question about whether our government should take proactive steps to prevent the importation of potentially dangerous children   s products  particularly toys manufactured in China  In 2006  China was the largest importer of toys  dolls  and games to the American marketplace   These imports total  14 6 billion and account for 86  of total U S  imports of toys  dolls  and games   Although most of these toys are safe  recent events suggest that a number of Chinese manufacturers are cutting corners and using cheap and illegal substitutes such as lead paint   The resulting lower prices of many foreign made toys are attractive  especially to low income families  who  along with the rest of our citizens  trust that products imported into the United States undergo a thorough inspection   Unfortunately  it appears that their trust may be misplaced  If we have an opportunity to protect our nation   s most vulnerable population     our children     from harmful toxins  we should do so  and a good place to start is safeguarding their toys   Since the USTR is responsible for developing and coordinating U S  international trade policy and overseeing negotiations with other countries  I am interested in learning the following    Given the large number of toys imported from China with high lead levels  has USTR raised concerns about this issue with the Chinese government   If so  what is the response of the Chinese government to these concerns  If these concerns have not been raised with the Chinese government  does USTR intend to raise this issue in the near future  I request that you respond to these questions by August 21  2007   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
