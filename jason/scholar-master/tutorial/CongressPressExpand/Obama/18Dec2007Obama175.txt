   Obama Statement on FCC Ruling to Expand Media Consolidation   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Statement on FCC Ruling to Expand Media Consolidation Tuesday  December 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the Federal Communications Commission s  FCC  ruling to allow greater media consolidation across the country   This ruling will allow large media outlets to become larger  potentially cutting out small business  women and minority owned firms   Last week  Obama joined Senator John Kerry  D MA  to call on FCC Chairman Kevin J  Martin to postpone the vote to modify existing ownership rules   He also joined a bipartisan coalition of senators vowing to nullify the FCC s vote through legislative prerogatives if the Commission moved forward with the vote   In October  Obama called on Martin to launch an independent review panel to develop proposals to further promote media ownership diversity   And Obama cosponsored the Media Ownership Act of 2007   S 2332   introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND   which would ensure openness and accountability in FCC media ownership rules and launch a review panel     The text of the statement is below     Today the FCC failed to further the important goal of promoting diversity in the media and instead chose to put big corporate interests ahead of the people s interests   Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play a critical role in African American and Latino communities and help bring minority issues to the forefront of our national dialogue   We must ensure that we have an open media market that represents all of the voices in our diverse nation  and allows them to be heard      I am disappointed that the FCC failed to meet its obligations to diverse communities and ensure that broadcasters are doing right by the communities in which they operate   Congress will not stand by and allow the FCC to move forward with these regulatory changes  and I will urge my colleagues to push forward legislation that ensures any changes will be evaluated and modified in a transparent and inclusive process  and fully takes into account the interests of our women and minority owned outlets  and communities                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election
