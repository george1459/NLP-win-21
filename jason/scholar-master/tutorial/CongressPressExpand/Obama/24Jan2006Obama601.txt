Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201    Dear Secretary Leavitt     As you know  during the next few weeks  millions of America s seniors and people with disabilities face the difficult task of selecting a Medicare prescription drug plan   As you also know  we were not members of Congress in 2003 when the Medicare Modernization Act  MMA  was enacted   We therefore have no political stake in defending or criticizing the merits of the law that created the prescription drug benefit   As public servants  however  we have every interest in ensuring that seniors and people with disabilities receive reliable  accurate information  that the federal government prohibits insurers and agents from victimizing seniors in the marketing of the plans  that seniors and people with disabilities get the assistance necessary to make informed choices  and that the prescription benefit is properly implemented     Given the enormous health and financial implications  Americans have every right to expect that the benefit plan will be implemented in an efficient  comprehensible and fair manner   Two years after the enactment of the MMA  we are deeply troubled by recent newspaper reports and complaints we have received from constituents that highlight flaws in the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit     For example  misinformation provided by your Department has caused significant confusion   The 2006 Medicare   You handbook mailed to 42 million beneficiaries contained significant errors regarding the monthly premiums that plans will charge low income enrollees   The informational insert published in Parade magazine misrepresented the Medicare drug benefit as more generous than it really is   Moreover  when beneficiaries call 1 800 MEDICARE  the primary source for information regarding the drug benefit  they often encounter automated messages requesting that they call back   Many beneficiaries complain that when they are connected to a live person  the operators are unable to answer all but the most basic questions regarding the benefit plans   Given the lack of accurate information available to beneficiaries  it is no surprise that a recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the majority of seniors do not understand the Medicare drug benefit       Recent newspaper reports also reveal that seniors may be at risk of being defrauded by unscrupulous insurers and agents who reportedly have visited their residences uninvited  pressured them to select particular plans  misrepresented plans  and requested personal information such as Social Security numbers and banking information   Although it is impossible to completely prevent fraudulent activities by unscrupulous persons  it does not appear that state and federal authorities have a coordinated plan of action to deter fraudulent conduct and to swiftly prosecute insurers and agents who engage in illegal activities   Implementation of the new drug benefit should not be an open invitation for scam artists to take advantage of senior citizens        In light of these reports  we strongly urge you to take immediate action to address these concerns  and request that you provide our offices with answers to the following questions as soon as possible   What actions has your Department taken to correct the misinformation provided to beneficiaries   Does your Department have a way to determine whether the corrected information is reaching beneficiaries Is there an adequate communications strategy for interacting with individuals with disabilities or for those without sufficient English or reading abilities Are the 1 800 MEDICARE informational centers properly staffed to respond to the inquiries What actions has your Department taken to ensure that operators who staff the 1 800 MEDICARE information centers are properly trained to meaningfully respond to questions concerning the benefit plans  Is there a coordinated plan between federal and state authorities to investigate and prosecute insurers  agents and others who engage in fraudulent and otherwise illegal conduct in marketing and selling the benefit plans   If so  what is the plan What actions has the Department implemented to deter fraudulent conduct in the marketing of the plans  including monitoring the conduct of authorized plan insurers      We request that you provide this information to us by January 3  2006      We owe Medicare beneficiaries clarity  fairness  and our best efforts to implement the benefit plan   Similarly  we owe our Americans assurances that their tax dollars are spent wisely and efficiently   We look forward to reviewing your response  and to overseeing effective  timely interventions to address the shortcomings of the implementation effort to date          Sincerely
