   Obama Opposes Mukasey Nomination   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Opposes Mukasey Nomination Tuesday  October 30  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today issued the following statement on his opposition to Judge Michael Mukasey   s nomination as attorney general      After the dismal performance of the last attorney general  I had hoped that Judge Michael Mukasey would represent a badly needed change in direction for the Justice Department and the nation   But his testimony before the Senate was stunning     While his legal credentials are strong  his views on two critical and related matters are  in my view  disqualifying  We don t need another attorney general who believes that the President enjoys an unwritten right to secretly ignore any law or abridge our constitutional freedoms simply by invoking national security   And we don t need another attorney general who looks the other way on issues as profound as torture   Judge Mukasey s professed ignorance of the debate over the propriety of practices like    waterboarding     or simulated drowning  as a means of interrogation  was appalling     We are a nation of laws  and those laws apply equally to the President of the United States and common citizens   We need an attorney general who understands and appreciates that inviolable principle     For these reasons  I will oppose this nomination
