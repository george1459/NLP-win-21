                                    Obama Calls on President to Protect Affordable Housing in New Orleans  Keep Promise to Gulf Coast Tuesday  December 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Despite urgent housing needs  Administration intends to drastically reduce federal housing in New Orleans WASHINGON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  calling on him to abandon his Administration   s intentions to demolish federally assisted housing in New Orleans  Louisiana until there is a comprehensive plan to meet the Gulf Coast region   s extensive affordable housing needs   Despite an estimated 12 000 people already homeless in New Orleans  and thousands more struggling with costly and slow rebuilding efforts since Hurricane Katrina  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  is now planning to reduce the limited supply of affordable housing even further by demolishing 4 500 units of public housing   Over the past two years  the Bush Administration has consistently failed Gulf Coast residents  and should not further exacerbate this tragic housing crisis by destroying affordable housing    The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President    I urge you to abandon all plans to demolish federally assisted housing in New Orleans  Louisiana until there is a comprehensive plan to meet the region s extensive affordable housing needs      Two years ago  when you appeared in Jackson Square  you spoke of America s    duty to confront this poverty with bold action     You explained      Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive  but to thrive  not just to cope  but to overcome   We want evacuees to come home  for the best of reasons    because they have a real chance at a better life in a place they love        Unfortunately  there are an estimated 12 000 people already homeless in New Orleans  and thousands more are struggling with costly and slow rebuilding efforts and private rents that have risen 45  since the storm   More than two thirds of the housing stock was destroyed by the hurricane  and much of it has not yet been rebuilt   Thousands of residents are still living in trailers with dangerous levels of formaldehyde even though more than 800 days have passed since Hurricane Katrina made landfall     Despite this harsh reality  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  is now planning to reduce the limited supply of affordable housing even further by demolishing 4 500 units of public housing   Notwithstanding your wish for evacuees to come home to    thrive    and    overcome     New Orleans does not have adequate affordable housing options even for the people who are already there         It is critical for policy makers to answer the following questions before any demolition takes place     Is demolition  which was originally planned and approved before hurricane Katrina  still a sensible strategy in light of the region s housing crisis   How many new units of public housing will be built or acquired to replace the 4 500 scheduled for demolition   If less than 4 500  what is the plan to close the gap to get back at least to pre Katrina levels   If more than 4 500  what plans are in place to ensure adequate income diversity and economic integration    What plans are in place to meet the low income housing needs during the period between demolition and the availability of new housing    What supports are in place to assist residents during any housing transition   Almost a year ago  I visited New Orleans and posed similar questions to HUD   I have yet to receive an adequate response to that inquiry    There is no question that most displaced residents want to come back to their homes and apartments  but that is hardly possible if they return to a city with fewer affordable housing options available than it had before   I support the conversion to mixed income neighborhoods and greater economic integration  but such redevelopment plans must not be at the expense of adequate and improved housing options for the poor   No public housing should be demolished until HUD can point to an equivalent number of replacement units in the near vicinity      Over the past two years  the federal government has failed the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast   But there is still an opportunity to demonstrate that they are not forgotten   I urge you to reconsider the demolition of these housing units until there is a comprehensive plan to meet the region s extensive affordable housing needs   Thank you      Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls
