                         Obama Offers Plan to Stop Escalation of Iraq War  Begin Phased Redeployment of Troops Tuesday  January 30  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 30  2007  Obama Offers Plan to Stop Escalation of Iraq War  Begin Phased Redeployment of Troops Goal to Redeploy All Combat Brigades out of Iraq by March 31  2008   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced binding and comprehensive legislation that not only reverses the President s dangerous and ill conceived escalation of the Iraq war  but also sets a new course for U S  policy that can bring a responsible end to the war and bring our troops home    Our troops have performed brilliantly in Iraq  but no amount of American soldiers can solve the political differences at the heart of somebody else s civil war   Obama said   That s why I have introduced a plan to not only stop the escalation of this war  but begin a phased redeployment that can pressure the Iraqis to finally reach a political settlement and reduce the violence     The Obama plan offers a responsible yet effective alternative to the President s failed policy of escalation   Realizing there can be no military solution in Iraq  it focuses instead on reaching a political solution in Iraq  protecting our interests in the region  and bringing this war to a responsible end   The legislation commences redeployment of U S  forces no later than May 1  2007 with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date that is consistent with the expectation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group    The plan allows for a limited number of U S  troops to remain as basic force protection  to engage in counter terrorism  and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces   If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration  this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment  provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States     The American people have been asked to be patient too many times  too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent   Obama said   It s time for a policy that can bring a responsible end to this war and bring our troops home    Fact Sheet  The Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007 Today  Senator Obama introduced the Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007   The Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007 is binding and comprehensive legislation that not only reverses the President s dangerous and ill conceived escalation  but also sets a new course for U S  policy in Iraq that can bring a responsible end to the war and bring our troops home   It implements   with the force of law   a phased redeployment of U S  forces that remains our best leverage to pressure the Iraqi government to achieve the political solution necessary to promote stability   It also places conditions on future economic aid to the government of Iraq and calls for the United States to lead a broad and sustained diplomatic initiative within the region   This plan is based on Senator Obama s November 20th  2006 speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  and it implements key recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group     The Obama plan offers a responsible yet effective alternative to the President s failed policy of escalation   Realizing there can be no military solution in Iraq  it focuses instead on reaching a political solution in Iraq  protecting our interests in the region  and bringing this war to a responsible end   The legislation commences redeployment of U S  forces no later than May 1  2007 with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date that is consistent with the expectation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group   The plan allows for a limited number of U S  troops to remain as basic force protection  to engage in counter terrorism  and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces   If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration  this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment  provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States     In short  the Obama plan halts the escalation and requires a responsible  phased redeployment of American forces from Iraq in a manner that protects U S  troops and exerts leverage to achieve the political settlement among the Iraqis   Key Elements of Obama Plan Stops the Escalation  Caps the number of U S  troops in Iraq at the number in Iraq on January 10  2007   This does not affect the funding for our troops in Iraq  This cap has the force of law and could not be lifted without explicit Congressional authorization  De escalates the War with Phased Redeployment   Commences a phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq not later than May 1  2007  with the goal that all combat brigades redeploy from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date consistent with the expectation of the Iraq Study Group   This redeployment will be both substantial and gradual  and will be planned and implemented by military commanders   Makes clear that Congress believes troops should be redeployed to the United States  to Afghanistan  and to other points in the region  A residual U S  presence may remain in Iraq for force protection  training of Iraqi security forces  and pursuit of international terrorists  Enforces Tough Benchmarks for Progress    These 13 benchmarks are based on President Bush s own statements and Administration documents and include  Security  Significant progress toward fulfilling security commitments  including eliminating restrictions on U S  forces  reducing sectarian violence  reducing the size and influence of the militias  and strengthening the Iraqi Army and Police  Political Accommodation  Significant progress toward reaching a political solution  including equitable sharing of oil revenues  revision of de Baathification  provincial elections  even handed provision of government services  and a fair process for a constitutional amendment to achieve national reconciliation  Economic Progress   Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than  10 billion for reconstruction  job creation  and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make up of Iraqi regions    Should these benchmarks be met  the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment  subject to the agreement of Congress    Congressional oversight   Requires the President to submit reports to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government s progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals  Intensified Training  Intensifies training of Iraqi security forces to enable the country to take over security responsibility of the country  Conditions on Economic Assistance   Conditions future economic assistance to the Government of Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks   Allows exceptions for humanitarian  security  and job creation assistance   Regional Diplomacy  Launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative   that includes key nations in the region   to help achieve a political settlement among the Iraqi people  end the civil war in Iraq  and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and regional conflict   Recommends the President should appoint a Special Envoy for Iraq to carry out this diplomacy within 60 days   Mandates that the President submit a plan to prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider regional conflict
