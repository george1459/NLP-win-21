   Domenici  Obama Cosponsor Bill to Expand Mental Health Care Access for Veterans   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Domenici  Obama Cosponsor Bill to Expand Mental Health Care Access for Veterans Wednesday  May 23  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Courtney Sanders  Domenici  or Ben LaBolt  Obama  Measure Extends Readjustment Services to Military Families WASHINGTON     U S  Senators Pete Domenici  R N M   and Barack Obama  D Ill   today introduced legislation to improve access to services for the thousands of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who are increasingly struggling with combat related mental health disorders   Domenici and Obama have cosponsored the Veterans    Mental Health Outreach and Access Act  a bipartisan measure that will authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  VA  to develop and implement a comprehensive national program to increase the availability of mental health support so that veterans affected by combat related mental health problems do not go without the care they need   The Domenici Obama bill would place particular emphasis on National Guardsmen and Reserve veterans serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom  These    civilian soldiers    often return from combat duty and immediately resume civilian life and may not have adequate access to readjustment services  The legislation includes provisions to extend counseling services to veterans    families  who may also experience issues with readjustment after their loved ones have returned from deployment       Virtually all returning veterans and their families will face readjustment problems    These soldiers and their families deserve the best care and treatment possible  but for those returning to communities remote from VA services  care isn   t always available  It is my hope that this legislation will help close the gaps we currently have in our mental health service delivery systems and provide support to those who have experienced mental health problems as a result of their service to their country     said Domenici  a longtime mental health advocate        As many of our bravest men and women return from Iraq and Afghanistan with combat related psychological injuries  our top priority should be providing them with the mental health care they deserve     said Senator Obama      This legislation will strengthen mental health and peer counseling support for our veterans  as well as launch a national effort to ensure our Guardsmen and Reservists living in rural communities receive the same quality and access to mental health care as every other veteran served by the Veterans Administration     said Obama   Recognizing the seriousness and prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems among veterans  the Domenici Obama bill calls on the VA Secretary to develop a national program to train returning service members for positions as peer outreach workers and support specialists  In any remote areas of the country in which the VA determines there is inadequate access to a VA medical center  the bill directs the Secretary of the VA to contract with community mental health centers to provide treatment and support services and readjustment counseling  However  any resulting contracts would require centers to first train and adhere to the VA   s expertise and standards of care in mental health  It also will require any contract provider to hire a qualified peer specialist  as well as have its clinicians participate in a training program to ensure services are tailored to meet the specialized needs of combat affected veterans   New data from the Department of Defense indicates that since 2005  50 percent of Army National Guardsmen and 44 percent of Marine Reservists who served in Iraq have reported mental health concerns in post deployment assessments
