   Obama Calls on Mukasey to Address Racial Discrimination  Protecting Civil Rights   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Calls on Mukasey to Address Racial Discrimination  Protecting Civil Rights Wednesday  October 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Attorney General Designate  Judge Michael Mukasey  asking him how he intends to protect the civil rights of all Americans if he is confirmed Attorney General   In recent years  there has been a systematic failure by the Department of Justice to exhibit any significant commitment to upholding civil rights     particularly in the cases of the photo identification requirement for voting in Georgia  the Jena 6 in Louisiana  the death of a young man at a boot camp in Florida  and concerns that minorities have been steered into high cost subprime loans  In the letter  Obama requests Mukasey   s commitment to enhancing voting rights  enforcing the Voting Rights Act  ending racial profiling  and reversing the politicization of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice  The text of the letter is below  Dear Judge Mukasey   I write to you at a moment in our nation   s history that is fraught with unprecedented legal challenges and constitutional questions     a moment that highlights the extraordinary importance of the position for which you have been nominated   By all accounts  your distinguished legal career reflects a commitment to our Constitution and the rule of law   Unfortunately  this Administration     and your predecessors as Attorney General     have a poor track record in the area of investigating discrimination against racial minorities  while inexplicably focusing resources on a few  exceptional cases involving white victims   From attempts in Georgia to enact a voter identification requirement to the Jena 6 case in Louisiana to concerns that minorities have been steered into high cost subprime loans  we have seen a systematic failure by the Department of Justice to exhibit any significant commitment to upholding civil rights    At such a critical time in our nation   s history  we need an Attorney General determined to protect the rights of all Americans     in particular  those traditionally disadvantaged     and not someone who views his mission as serving as the President   s personal attorney   Since I am not a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  I will not have the opportunity today to ask you questions about your views on civil rights  For that reason  I ask that you provide responses to the following questions  1   In recent years  the Department of Justice has demonstrated a clear preference for investigating isolated examples of voter fraud  rather than more widespread allegations of disenfranchisement of minority voters   As Attorney General  will you commit to a program of enforcement that is aimed at enhancing  rather than diminishing  the ability of racial and ethnic minorities to vote   Will you commit to applying the Voting Rights Act to challenge voter identification laws such as those attempted in Georgia and other states    2   The Department of Justice seems to have weakened its stance on the enforcement of apparent racial profiling cases under 42 U S C 14141  which allows for civil lawsuits to be brought by the Department against racial profiling by our nation   s police departments   Will you commit to opening investigations and pursuing lawsuits against police departments that reveal a pattern or practice of police misconduct    3   In recent months  our nation   s attention has been focused on the racial strife in Jena  Louisiana  and the disparate treatment of six African American youths   As Attorney General  will you commit the investigative resources of the Civil Rights Division to ensuring the fair treatment and execution of the law in cases such as the Jena 6  as well as the recent acquittal by an all white jury of eight prison guards accused of killing a young black male at a juvenile detention center in Florida  4   Several studies have found that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered into high cost subprime loans than other borrowers  even after controlling for factors such as income  loan size  and property location   Although multiple concerns have been raised in recent years about discrimination in the housing market  the number of housing cases filed by the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section has fallen from 53 in 2001 to 31 in 2006  and cases involving discrimination have fallen by 60    In 2003  the Justice Department announced that it would no longer file disparate impact cases involving housing discrimination     a sharp break from DOJ   s longstanding and bipartisan policy to aggressively litigate these cases   In light of recent reports of stark racial disparities in the subprime lending market and the sharp drop in housing discrimination enforcement actions  what steps will you take to ensure that the nation s housing discrimination laws are vigorously enforced   Will you commit the Housing and Civil Enforcement Division to investigating whether the practices of the mortgage lending industry violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act  Fair Housing Act  or other federal antidiscrimination statutes  5   In 2002  the Bush Administration placed political appointees in charge of hiring new attorneys in the Civil Rights Division     departing from the longstanding practice of giving this hiring authority to career professionals   Since then  less than half of new hires in the Division   s important Appellate  Employment Litigation  and Voting Sections have had any prior civil rights experience     and less than a quarter have had any prior experience enforcing the nation   s civil rights laws   The others  according to a Boston Globe analysis     gained their experience either by defending employers against discrimination lawsuits or by fighting against race conscious policies      Will you pledge to restore professionalism and end the practice of politicized hires within the Civil Rights Division   What specific steps will you take to reverse these trends in hiring  6  What is your opinion of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act  which I introduced in January 2007 and which recently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee   Do you agree that this legislation is necessary  I believe that with the proper leadership  the Department of Justice can reclaim its historical leadership role in fighting racial discrimination and ensuring equal protection under the law   I appreciate your attention to my questions  and I look forward to your response   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator
