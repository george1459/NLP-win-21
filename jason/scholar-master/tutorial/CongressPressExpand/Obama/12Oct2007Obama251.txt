Violates Conditions of Clean Water Act Friday  October 12  2007  For Immediate Release    Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin   Amy Brundage  Obama   Kathleen Connery  Emanuel  or Sarah Feinberg  Nick Papas Call on Indiana Governor  US EPA  and Regional EPA to work with US Steel to protect Lake Michigan  WASHINGTON  D C      Continuing their effort to fight for the environmental health and protection of Lake Michigan  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Rahm Emanuel  D IL  today  along with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and members of the Chicago delegation  sent a letter to U S  Steel Corporation  calling for a meeting with the Chairman and CEO to discuss Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s  IDEM  proposal to give U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana a wastewater permit that would allow them to operate for five more years without complying with current clean water standards      Durbin and Emanuel also sent letters to both the EPA Administrator  and the Region 5 EPA office commending them for coming out in opposition to the permit and asking them to work with IDEM and U S  Steel to right the situation   They sent a fourth letter to the Governor of Indiana asking for his cooperation    In today s letter to U S  Steel the members wrote     Lake Michigan is our Grand Canyon  our Yellowstone  and we hope that you will join us in working to protect the lake   It is our understanding that US Steel has been working to come into compliance with clean water requirements at the Gary  Indiana facility for over a decade   We strongly oppose any efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan      According to an article in today   s Chicago Tribune  Gary Works  located about 15 miles southeast of Chicago  is the largest source of water pollution in the Lake Michigan basin  dumping more than 1 7 million pounds in 2005   The facility has been operating under an expired permit that has been extended by state officials since 1994   The proposed permit would allow Gary Works to increase its discharge of pollutants  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  and nitrates  into the Grand Calumet River  which flows directly into Lake Michigan   Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional 5 years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  Senator Durbin and Congressman Emanuel sent four letters regarding the proposed IDEM permit   In a letter to the EPA Administrator  Stephen Johnson  both Illinois members applauded EPA for rejecting the proposed IDEM permit and urged them to review all proposed permits in order to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act   Further  in their letter to the EPA Region 5 Administrator  Mary Gade  Durbin and Emanuel questioned U S  Steel   s compliance with the Clean Water Act  In their letter to the Governor of Indiana  Mitch Daniels  Durbin and Emanuel stressed that economic development and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   Finally  in a letter to the Chairman and CEO of U S  Steel Corporation  John Surma  signed by Durbin  Obama  Emanuel and members of the Chicago Congressional Delegation  they asked for a meeting to discuss the company   s decision to seek a permit that threatens water quality in Lake Michigan   text of letters below  October 12  2007 Mr  John P  Surma  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  United States Steel Corporation  600 Grant Street  Pittsburgh  PA 15219 Dear Mr  Surma  After reading this morning   s Chicago Tribune article regarding the proposed wastewater permit for your company   s Gary  Indiana facility  we write to express our strong concern and request a meeting with you to discuss the potential effects of this permit on the health of Lake Michigan and all of the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes account for 95  of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90  of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes need greater environmental stewardship  not an increase in pollution   Economic development and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand    Lake Michigan is our Grand Canyon  our Yellowstone  and we hope that you will join us in working to protect the lake   It is our understanding that US Steel has been working to come into compliance with clean water requirements at the Gary  Indiana facility for over a decade   We strongly oppose any efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan   Due to a public dialogue and the involvement of concerned local citizens  BP reconsidered their decision to increase their permitted discharge levels and is now working to expand their Whiting refinery without discharging more ammonia and other pollutants into Lake Michigan   We urge you to reconsider your company   s decision to seek a permit that threatens water quality in Lake Michigan and invite you to meet with us to discuss this important issue   Please contact Jen Waller in Congressman Emanuel   s office at 202 225 4061 or Michael Kolenc in Senator Durbin   s office at 202 224 9447 to set up a meeting  and we look forward to hearing from you  Sincerely    October 12  2007  Ms  Mary Gade  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency Region 5  77 W  Jackson Blvd   Chicago  IL 60604  Dear Ms  Gade   We are writing today to express our strong concern about the Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s proposed wastewater permit for U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana    We commend you for formally objecting to the proposed permit and urge you to work with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management  IDEM  to ensure that any new permits issued do not further threaten the health and water quality of Lake Michigan    Compliance with the Clean Water Act calls for a steady reduction in pollutants discharged into public waters   After nearly a decade  it appears that U S  Steel is still not in compliance with either the Clean Water Act or the standards in the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative  GLI    We encourage you to ensure that the final permit makes significant strides towards minimizing pollutants      Following this latest news about IDEM   s proposed U S  Steel permit and the recent controversy over BP   s NPDES permit for their Whiting refinery  we are concerned about additional permits under consideration in Indiana   We urge you to undertake a detailed review of any additional  state approved permits to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act   EPA   s oversight role is critical as we work together to ensure the health of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes  Sincerely  Rahm Emanuel                                        Member of Congress                                           Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator   October 12  2007  The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator   U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington  DC 20460  Dear Administrator Johnson   We are writing to express our strong concern over the Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s proposed wastewater permit for U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana   According to many experts  the permit would allow the Gary Works to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  nitrates and more    Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional five years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  As such  we are relieved to hear that the EPA has formally objected to this permit  particularly with regard to the discharge limits and five year compliance schedules   A mere three months ago  we wrote to express our concern regarding IDEM   s permit for BP   s Whiting  Indiana facility   There are still unanswered questions regarding that permit and EPA   s oversight of its issuance  and we hope that the EPA will work with Indiana to make sure that permits issued by IDEM do not threaten the health of the Great Lakes   We all want to work together to protect Lake Michigan    It has come to our attention that there may be additional permits being reviewed by IDEM and we urge you to undertake a detailed review of all proposed permits to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and the standards of the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative  GLI    It   s time to improve rather than threaten the health of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes  As you are well aware  President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in order to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      We agree with the President that the Great Lakes are among our nation   s greatest treasures  and we need to take action to protect them   We thank you for objecting to the proposed permit allowing U S  Steel to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River and hope that we can work with you as you revise the permit with the state of Indiana to draft a permit consistent with the Clean Water Act  the GLI  and the goal of improving the health of the Great Lakes   Sincerely    Rahm Emanuel                                        Member of Congress                                           Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator   cc  Mary Gade  Regional Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 October 12  2007 The Honorable Mitch Daniels  Governor   Dear Governor Daniels  After reading this morning   s Chicago Tribune article regarding the proposed wastewater permit for US Steel   s Gary  Indiana  facility  we write to express our strong concern about the potential impact of this proposal and others like it on the health of Lake Michigan   President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      The permit currently under review by the State of Indiana appears to move in the opposite direction   You sit in a unique position  with the potential to make a positive  lasting impact on the Lake   The State of Indiana can and should work with industry in the state to encourage compliance with the Clean Water Act goals and to participate as stewards of Lake Michigan     We all know how important Lake Michigan is for our states and for the country   The Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90 percent of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes need greater environmental stewardship  not greater levels of pollution    We believe that economic infrastructure and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   U S  Steel   s Gary Works is one of the region   s biggest employers and contributes to the supply of domestic steel   Our hope is that as U S  Steel serves these functions for our region  it also will recognize its obligation to more aggressively mitigate pollutants discharged into the public waterways   We urge the State of Indiana to reevaluate this permit  and work with the EPA and U S  Steel to protect the Lake      Sincerely   Rahm Emanuel                                        Member of Congress                                           Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator
