                             Obama  Harkin  Others Ask Bush to Help Black Farmers Who Were Victims of Discrimination Friday  October  5  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Kate Cyrul  Harkin   Melanie Roussell  Conyers   Jonathan Godfrey  Conyers   or Corey Ealons  Davis    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Joe Biden  D DE   and Representatives John Conyers  D MI   Bennie Thompson  D MS   Artur Davis  D AL   Jerrold Nadler  D NY   Bobby Scott  D VA  and Steve Chabot  R OH  yesterday to President Bush asking him to investigate allegations of the USDA lobbying against legislation that would bring compensation for black farmers who were victims of discrimination  The Pigford settlement  approved in 1999  allowed black farmers to file claims against the USDA for failing to respond to racial discrimination complaints between 1983 and 1997  Recently passed legislation in the House of Representatives would allow certain previously denied farmers an opportunity to re file their settlement claims and have them reviewed on their merits  Obama has introduced companion legislation  S  1989  in the Senate  Below is a copy of the letter  October 4  2007 President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC Dear Mr  President  We write to express our serious concerns about the apparent posture of the United States Department of Agriculture     USDA     toward efforts in Congress to provide a small measure of justice to African American farmers who were victims of discrimination   We refer specifically to the alleged efforts of individual USDA employees to lobby illegally to undermine remedial civil rights legislation passed in the House of Representatives as well as the apparent USDA strategy of criticizing Congressional efforts for raising    false hopes    among farmers while doing nothing affirmative to make legitimate hopes of compensation for past abuses come true   By way of background  in 1999  the USDA settled a class action lawsuit with African American farmers in the case of Pigford v  Glickman   The U S  District Court for the District of Columbia approved of this settlement as    a good first step towards assuring that the kind of discrimination that has been visited on African American farmers since Reconstruction will not continue into the next century      Opinion in Pigford v  Glickman  Civil Action No  97 1978   The order of the Court concluded     the Department of Agriculture and the county commissioners discriminated against African American farmers when they denied  delayed  or otherwise frustrated the applications of those farmers for farm loans and other credit and benefit programs     The denial of credit and benefits has had a devastating impact on African American farmers      This settlement  known as the Pigford consent decree  brought relief to over 20 000 black farmers and was indeed a good first step towards righting an historic wrong   Unfortunately  for a variety of reasons  approximately 75 000 additional black farmers filed their claims of discrimination through the Pigford consent decree claims adjudication process after the filing deadline   As a result  thousands of victims of discrimination continue to be denied an opportunity even to have their claims heard and evaluated on the merits  H R  2419  which passed the House of Representatives on July 27  2007  provides qualifying late Pigford claimants with a right to go to court and have their cases adjudicated on the merits   Similar bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the Senate and may be included in the Senate version of the farm bill   We urge your support for this important and overdue legislation  It appears  however  that USDA is intent on undermining these efforts   There were reports in early August about USDA Farm Services Agency  FSA  employees using federal resources to lobby against the legislation passed in the House   And more recently the General Counsel has publicly criticized the legislation on the grounds that there are 30 times as many valid claims of discrimination as the  100 million funding provided in the House bill will cover   We welcome USDA   s concern that black farmers not be shut out yet again from receiving just compensation for the wrongs they have suffered   If the USDA believes  however  as its General Counsel suggests  that two thirds of the 75 000 late filers will show legitimate claims of discrimination by the USDA  the right thing for the USDA to do is to work as a good faith partner in crafting a fair and responsible remedy  The USDA should sit down with class counsel  the judge and any other appropriate parties to discuss options for modifying the consent decree or finding other ways to accommodate additional late filers    We firmly believe that farmers who believe they have been the victims of discrimination should be allowed to have their cases heard and adjudicated on the merits  Those most familiar with the farmers    claims believe that the cost estimates significantly overstate potential Federal exposure from permitting this limited class of mostly poor farmers to bring cases in court   Whether one believes that a funding limitation is advisable or not  however  we cannot sit by aware of injustice and do nothing   That may be the USDA approach  but it is not an approach that Congress can continue to tolerate    Congress is working to come up with a fair remedy to address this issue   We would like your administration to step up to the plate    We respectfully request that by October 15  you let us know the following   1 The status of the internal investigation  announced by former Secretary Mike Johanns before his resignation last month  of the allegations that USDA employees illegally used federal resources to lobby against legislation   2 The position of your administration on petitioning the court to open the consent decree in order to address the status of late filers    In the Court   s opinion accepting the original settlement  Judge Friedman declared     While the USDA landscape has remained resistant to change for many seasons  the labors of these farmers are beginning to bear fruit   This settlement represents one significant harvest   It is up to the Secretary of Agriculture and other responsible officials at the USDA to fulfill its promises to ensure that this shameful period is never repeated and to bring the USDA into the twenty first century     Though the harvest of the original settlement turned out to be disappointing for too many farmers  we urge the full and immediate support of your Administration to make things right at last    Sincerely  Senator Barack Obama

                                             Congressman Steve Chabot  Congressman Artur Davis                                                                   Congressman Jerrold Nadler   Congressman Bobby Scott
